Shebeing the only child of her parents,was brought up with all care and ten-dernefs imaginable; not wanting a-ny education that was thought necef-fary or proper for her; her naturaltemper, which was very airy, beingjoined to her edi^patioH, and that de¬gree of pride which, as it is natural,Ibme make neceflary for the femalefex, helped to fet her off to the bell.advantage. Fine feathers make finebirds ; and it the birds are fine withoutthem, doubtlefs they make them fodoublyThis lovely woman was the delightof her father,'who clothed her richly,adorned her with jewels; and histrade lying among the court ladies,he often carried her with him to (hewher the paftimes, which were madethere, frequently to divert the Queen,&c. which gave her an early longingafter a greater genteelity than fhe hadever yet attained to, or her pity breed¬ing could produce.When fhe grew up to the age otfifteen, her competent ftock of beau¬ty and good carriage, caufed manyto fall in love with her, and fomegreat Lords fixed their eyes upon her,to get her tor a miftrefs, which herfather perceiving, fent her to his fitterat Northampton, where £he remainedabout a year, till h<f fuppofed the en-, quiry after her was over, and that (hemight return without any hazard ofbeing any further tempted to lewd-nefs. Yet {he was no fooner return¬ed but a deep plot was laid one nightto have her carried away by LordBattings j who, after the death of4King. Edward, he took her for hisconcubine", as will appear m the clofc;of this hiitqry But the ipcid he hadbribed with gold to get her abroad;repenting of fuch treachery to henmailer, gave timely nbtice, and fbprevented it.Her father perceiving that, unlefs!he ^took home fpeedy courfe, her!great flock of beauty would foon beher ruin, refolved to have her mar¬ried, fo that having furrendered hervirginity, and being in the arms of ahufhand, thofe that fought to crop hervirgin rofe would not regard her, butgive over the purfuit.She had many fuicors, and amongthofe that eafneflly fought her in theway of marriage, was one MatthewShore, a rich goldfmith in Lombard-ilreet, whom her father pitched uponas a husband, and acquainted his fairdaughter with his intention to matr-ryher to him, but fhe appeared veryaverfe to it, alledging fometimes dis¬proportion of years, he being above5thirty ; at other times his being dtl-figured with the fmall pox, and ma¬ny other exceptions she made. How¬ever, her fathers poinive commands,and the rich prefents her love madeher, won her confent, or feeminglyshe yielded to the match, so maxried they were in great pomp ; ma¬ny of the court, as well as of the ci¬ty, being invited to the wedding;whicli was kept with great feafting,many days.The wedding being now over, andthe bridegroom having enjoyed his! charming bride, grew exceedinglytond of her even to dcttage, whichfickened and palliated her love to¬ward him, and he perceiving it, droveto wind himfelf more into her affec¬tions ; and to this end he clothed he~i very richly, and adorned her wita} jewels, denying her nothing ihe de-v fired, or that he thought would tendf- to her fatisfaclion or delight.It was not long before Lord Haft-I ings heard the unwelcome tidings,>6that Krs Fair ]a^e was married; whichhowever, did not make him give overhis purftiit of enjoying her fair body,fo that he often reforted to fee her,treating her at home, and her hus¬band abroad; eften inviting themboth to court; and took his oppor¬tunisms to pour out many amorousdiicourfes, endeavouring by all meansto make her defile the marriage-bed.And one time, endeavouring to tryhis utmoft efforts, he threw her on abed, when they were alone; but (heget fiom him and ran to her husbumd,telling him plainly how rude LordHaftings had been ; which angeringShore, he modeflly rebuked him,forbidding him his houfe, which madehim run away in a great heat, refolv-ing to be revenged.This Lord being chamberlain toEdward the Fourth, having frequent¬ly his ear, and' finding he was muchinclined to Lady Elizabeth Gray, tookan opportunity to tell him of J&ne sbeauty, extolling her wit above herfeatures, which made the King hsat-7ken to this new adventure, and hsrefolved to go to Shore’s ihop in dif-guife to fee her.The King whofe thoughts ftill runon his intended miftrefs, delayed notlong to pay her a vifit; and in orderto it, attired himfelf like a merchant,and withdrew privately from thecourt, only attended by a page.And coming in to Shore’s (hop,then the richeft in Lombard ftreet, hefound the good man employed in hisbufinefs; and waiting till he was alittle at leilure, he dehred to fee fomeplate, which being fhewn him, he,under a pretence of carrying it be¬yond fea, foon agreed for a confide-,rable quantity.—But yet no wife ap¬peared, which made him delay .thetime with difcourfing about what wasthen tranfacting in England and pla¬ces abroad> where, lie faid. he had.travelled.This delighted Shore mightily, fi>that he ordered bis man to fetch up a8bottle 04r wine, and they drank mer¬rily, thergocdman beginning with ahealth to the King, which the Kingpledged him in. So when feme o-ther healths had palled, the King alk-ed if there was not a miftrefs to fofair a houfd ? otherwife he could helphim to a wife, rich and beautiful.For this offer; Shore thanked him,but told him he was already marriedto fuch a one as he deferibed, whomhe loved extremely. This difeourfemade the King more deffrous to leeher before he departed, and asked ifhe could not have a fight of her.Shore little thinking that this was in¬tended for his ruin, and proud of hiswife’s beauty, foon yielded to his re-queft, and ordered her to be calleddown; who came, attired in a skycoloured morning gown, floweredwith gold, embroidered with pearlsand ipangles, her head attired withcurious lace, under which her hairflowed wantonly, and herbludies madeher appear ftill more beautiful.^ ” ne king ro fboncr Taw her butne ftepped forth and fainted her coralhps, impreffing on them many bal¬my kiffits.

The King likedthis advance, and it was agreed thathe fliould fee her at this Mrs Blague’sand have freedom to court her ; butfhe Ihould not know that he was theKing, until he thought proper to haveit difcovered.Lord Haftings was not idle in pro¬moting his mafter’s happinefs, andwith gifts and large promifes foonmade the lace woman pliable, fo thatmany meetings were made at herhoufe, the King coming in dilguifeas her friend ; and though Mrs Blague12often left them alone, and the Kingcourted her with aU his rhetoric, yetHie appeared averfe to his love, andoften blamed him (liarply for per-fuading her to defile her hufband’sbed; and then {he would chide MrsBlague for fuffering fuch a rude manto come about her houfe, telling herthe defign he had oh her chaftity ; fhefeemed very much furprifed at it,but intreating her to be at eafe, for(he would not fuffer him to comethere again any more.This pacified her, but the plot wasftili deeper laid for her ruin; and atChrillmafs time, fhe got leave of MrShore for his wife to accompany herto the court, to fee the ball there,to which he confented with feme un-willingnefs. And foon after flic wasintroduced, a man of a very comelyport, entered with a mafk on ; andMrs Shore heard the ladies whiiper.That's the King; who looking roundthrough his mafk, fixed his eyes uponher, immediately ftepped up to herfeat, took her out to dance along with*3him. At this file blufiied, but notto be unmannerly, flic complied, andthe dance being ended, he took herto a fingle light, and pulling off hismask to ialute her, fhe perceived itwas the fame man whom (he hadfeen at her own thop, and at MrsBlague’s houfe ; and the King puttinga letter into her hand, retired. Shethen coming to Mrs Blague, defiredto go home; to this £he confented,and then read the letter, which wasto this purppfe:“ My lovely Jane,“ Tour beauty has enthralled my heart,M Uis a King fues ; you will be kind to■' him, and, by a line, tell him fo to his“ comfort ’When fhe read this letter, fhe leftMrs Blague abruptly, judging ihe hada hand in the matter.All that night the fair Jane war,refUefs; her husband enquired thecaufe, but could not learn it. Asfoon as fhe was up, {he went to MrsBlague to confult what fhe muft, doin this ftrait, well knowing the king’shumour.Mrs Blague feeing her thus pen-five, faid. come my dear, you muftnot be coy, nor deny the King’s re-queft; glitter near a thrpne, and en-joy a gallant bedfellow. I find he isrefolved to have you for a Miflrefs,and therefore it is belt for you, will¬ingly to comp/iy.At this difeourfe fhe trembled ; yetconfidering from the many attempts♦her beauty had caufed, that it was notmade to be enjoyed by one, in a fatalhour, fhe contented ; and inftead ofwriting an answer to the King’s let¬ter, it was agreed that very night (hefhould take her apparel, and put her-felf into the arms of the King,—Thisbeing concluded, Mrs Blague fentthe King notice, who fent a chariocfor them, and, in the mean time herclothes-were conveyed away to MrsBiague’s However fhe fupped with15her linfoand; when, on a fudden,fome body came on a feigned errand,and faid, her mother was taken ill, anddefired to fpeak with her.

tell me at noon where they feed ?Shall I seek thee onvsweet winding Tay,Or the pleasanter banks of the Tweed?GO, PLAINTIVE SOUNDS.Go, plaintive sounds ! and to the fair,My secret wounds impart,Tell all I hope, tell all I fear,Each motion in my heart.Bet she methinks is list’ning now,To some enchanting strain,The smile that triumphs o’er her brow,Seems not to heed my pain.Yes, plaintive sounds, yet, yet delay.Howe’er my love repine,Let that gay minute pass away,The next perhaps is thine.Yes, plaintive sounds, no longer crost,Youf griefs shall soon be o’er,Her cheek undimpled now has lost,The smile it lately wore.Yes, plaintive sounds, she now is yours,’Tis now your time to move;Easy to soften all her pnw’rs,he that s&ltens love.6Cease, plaintive soundsS./vrtuf fcV-fc is doneThat anxious tender air.Proves o’er her heart the conquest, won,I see vou ttieltinif there.v OReturn, ye smiles, return attain,Return each sprichtl' yVac^',I yield u > to your charming reign, ‘All that encha'itinir face.I take no outward shew amiss.Rove where they will, her ryes,StiU let her smiles eaeh shepherd bless,fc>o she but hear my sighs.THE YELLOW HAIR’D L \DDIE.The ydlo w hon’d !odd e ^at dovn on >’011 brae,Cried, milk the e ve... lassie, let na ne o' them gae jAna ay as she milked, she metrily san’tr,ifhc yellow-haii’d Lddie s|.,(|l be mj ^uJcman.And ay as she mdked, &c.The treather is can'd, -nd my c'a;t!iing it thin,The ewes are new dipt ; and they virna bught in {'Itiey winna luvht in. altho’ I s!

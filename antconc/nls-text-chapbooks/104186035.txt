His psalm-book from his pouch flang he,He clapp’d his hand upon the hedge.And o’er lap ho right wantonly.When Graham did see his bully come,The salt tears stood long in his o’e,Now needs must I say, thou art a man,That dare venture thy body to fight with me.Nay, I have a harness on my back,I know that thou hast none on thine ;But as little as thou hast on thy back,As little shall there be on mine.He flang his jacket from off his back.His cap of steel from his head flang he,He’s taken his spear into his hand,He’s ty’d his horse unto a tree.Now they fell to it with two broad swords,For two long hours fought Bewick and he,Much sweat was to be seen on them both,But never a drop of blood to see.Now Graham gave Bewick an awkward stroke,An awkward stroke surely struck he,Ho struck him under the left breast,Then down to the ground as dead fell he.Arise, arise, 0 bully Bewick,Arise, and speak three words to me,Is this to be thy deadly wound,Or God and good surgeons will mend thee !90 horse, O horse, 0 bully Graham,And pray do get thee far from me.Thy sword it is sharp, it hath wounded my heart,And so no farther can I gae.O hcfrse, O horse, 0 bully Graham,And get thee far from me with speed,And get thee out of this country quite,That not one may know who’s done the deed.Oh! if this be true, my bully dear.The words that thou dost tell to me.The vow I made, and the vow I’ll keep,T swear I’ll bo thp first to die.Then he stuck his sword in a mould-hill,And he leapt thirty good feet and three,First he bequeath’d his soul to God,And upon his own sword leapt he.Now Graham he was the first that died ;And then Sir Robert Bewick came to sco ;Arise, arise, 0 son, he said.For I see thou’s won the victory.Father, could not you drink your wine at home,And letten mo and my bully be,Now dig a grave both low and wide,And in it us two pray bury ?But bury my bully Graham on the sun side.For I’m sure he’s won the victory.Now we’ll leave off talking of these bold brethren.In Carlisle town, where they were slain,And talk of these two good old men,Where they were making a pitiful moan.10And now up spake Sir Robert Bewick,0 man, -was I not much to blame,I have lost one of the liveliest ladsThat ever was bred unto my namaWith that up spake my good Laird Graham,O man, I’ve lost the better block,I’ve lost my comfort and my joy,I’ve lost my key, I’ve lost my lock.Had I gone through all Lauderdale,And forty horse had set on me,Had Christy Graham been at my back.So well he would have guarded me.I have no more of my song to sing.But two or three words I will name—It will be talk’d in Carlisle town,That these two men were all the blame.3 £17/SHT.(T/I/ lii/ S • /UiTJTRBERKSHIRE LADY’S GARLAND.In Four Parts.PART I.Shewing Cupid’s Conquest oyer a coy Lady of

Thousand a-year, Ao.Tune—“ The Royal Forester.”Bachelors of every station,Mark this strange and true relation,Which in brief to you I bring—Never was a stranger thing.You shall find it worth the hearing:Loyal love is most endearing.When it takes the deepest root,Yielding charms and gold to boot.Some will wed for love of treasure ,But the sweetest joy and pleasureIs in faithful love, you’ll find,Graced with a noble mind.Such a noble disposition,Had this lady, with submission ;Of whom I this sonnet write,Store of wealth and beauty bright.She had left by a good grannum,Full five thousand pounds per annumWhich she held without control;Thus she did in riches roll.13Though she had vast stores of riches,Which some persons much bewitches.Yet she bore a courteous mind,Not the least to pride inclin’d.Many noble persons courtedThis young lady, ’tis reported,But their lab’ring prov’d in vain,They could not her favour gain.Though she made such true resistance,Yet by Cupid’s true assistance,She was conquer’d after all,How it was declare I shall.Being at a noble wedding,Near the famous town of Redding,A. young gentleman she saw.Who belonged to the law.As she view’d his sweet behaviour,Every courteous carriage gave herNew additions to her grief;Forc’d she was to seek relief.Privately she then enquir’dAbout him so much admir’d,Both his name and where ho dwelt,Such was the hot flames she felt.Then at night this youthful ladyCall’d her coach, whicirbeing ready,Homeward straight she did return.But, her heart in flames did burn.uijtweo trPART II.Th« l&ij’s Letter of a Challenge to fight him upon refyging to wedher in a mask, without knowing who she was.Night and morning, for a season,In her closet would she reasonWith herself, and often said,Why has love my heart betray’d fI that have so many slighted,Am at length so well requited,For my griefs are not a few ;Now I find what love can doHe that has my heart in keeping.Though I for his sake be weeping,Little knows what grief I feel,But I’ll try it out with steel.For I will a challenge send him,And appoint where I’ll attend him ;In a grove without delay,By the dawning of the day.He shall not the least discover,That I am a virgin lover,By the challenge which I send;But for justice I contend.He has caused sad distraction,And I come for satisfaction,Which if he denies to give, 'One of us shall cease to live.Having thus her mind revealed,She her letter clos’d and sealed;Now when it came to his hand,The young man was at a stand.In her letter she conjur’d him,For to meet, and well assur’d him,Recompence he must afford,Or dispute it with the sword.Having read this strange relation.He was in a consternation:Then advising with his friend,He persuades him to attend.Be of courage and make ready,Famt heart never won fair lady..In regard it must be so,I along with you must go.inn; fifiLj vru v-i.t of eovlo ■ n oilV/. louiiifj I t i jiI <jil H./nlq laid vrodi oJ ;od I JuHtfldf I flit)

appointment in a grove, where she r blk'ed him toEarly on a summer’s morning,When bright Phoebus was adorningEvery bower with its beams,The fair lady came, it seems.At the bottom of the mountain,Near a pleasant crystal fountain,There she left her gilded coach,While the grove she did approach.Cover’d with her mask, and walking,There she met her lover talkingWith a friend that he had brought ;Straight she ask’d him who he sought.I am challeng’d by a gallant,Who resolves to try my talent;Who he is I cannot say.But I hope to show him play.It Is 1 that did invito you,You shall wed me, or I’ll fight you,Underneath those spreading trees,Therefore choose you which you please.You shall find I do not vapour,I have brought my trusty rapier,Therefore take your choice, says she,Either fight or marry me.fight or wed her.Said he, Madam, praj what meai■ ^oufIn my life I’ve never ?een you:Pray unmask, your visage show.Then I’ll tell you Aye or No.I will not my face uncoverTill the marriage ties are over,Therefore choose you which you will,Wed me, sir, or try your skill.Step within that pleasant bower,With your friend one single hour ;Strive your thoughts to reconcile,And I’ll wander here the while.While this charming lady waited,The young bachelors debated,What was best for to be done :Quoth his friend, the hazard run.If my judgment can be trusted.Wed her first—you can’t be worsted ;If she’s rich, you’ll rise to fame,If she’s poor, why you’re the same.He consented to be married ;In her coach they all were carried,To a church without delay,Where he weds the lady gay.The sweet pretty Cupids hover’dRound her eyes, her face was cover’dWith a mask—lie took her thus,Just for better or for worse.With a courteous kind behaviour,She presents his friend a favour.And withal dismiss’d him straight,That he might no longer wait.18Suerv in,o>PART IV.How they rode together in her gilded coach to her noble seat orcastle, tic.As the gilded coach stood ready,The young lover and his lady,Rode together till they cameTo her house of state and fame.Which appeared like a castle,Where he might behold a parcelOf young cedars tall and straight,Just before her palace gate.Hand in hand they walk’d together.To a hall, or parlour rather,Which was beautiful and fair—All alone she left him there.Two long hours there he waitedHer return —at length he fretted,And began to grieve at last.For he had not broke his fast.Still he sat like one amazed,Round a spacious room he gazed,Which was richly beautify’d ;But, alas ! he lost his bride.There was peeping, laughing, sneering,• All within the lawyer’s hearing ;But his bride he could not see ;Would 1 were at home, thought he.While his heart was melancholy,Said the steward, brisk and jolly.Tell me, friend, how you came here ?You have some design, I fear.nil woHHe reply’d, dear loving master,You shall meet with no disaster,Through my means, in any case—Madam brought me to this place.Then the steward did retire,Saying, that he would enquire.Whether it was true or no :Never was love hamper’d so.Now the lady who had fill’d himWith those fears, full well beheld hiMFrom a window, where she drest,Pleased at the pleasant jest.When she had herself attir’d,In rich robes to be admir’d,She appeared in his sight,Like a moving angel bright.Sir, my servants have related.How you have some hours waitedIn my parlour—tell me whoIn my house you ever knew.Madam, if I have offended,It is more than I intended;A young lady brought me here—That is true, said she, my dear.1 can be no longer cruelTo my joy and only jewel,Thou art mine, and I am thine,Hand and heart I do resign.< T:" •Once I was a wounded lover,Now these fears are fairly over ;By receiving what I gave,Thou art lord of what I have.Beauty, honour, love, and treasure,A rich golden stream of pleasure,With his lady he enjoys ;Thanks to Cupid’s kind decoys.Now he’s cloth’d in rich attire,Not inferior to a squire,Beauty, honour, riches, store.What can man desire more.1THECOMIC TALEOIMARGARET AND THE MINISTER.A douse, religious, kintry wife.That liv’d a quiet contented life,To show respect unto the priest,Whom she esteem’d within her breast,Catch’d twa

no relief!Heigh ho! what can be the matter with Nancy ?( 7 )With ray head on my pillow I feek for repofe,Which comes to the wretched, and foftenrtheir woes;.But fleeplefs, though blamelefs, I figh through the night;And the day can’t relieve me, though never fo bright.In vain I perplex my poor fancy, &c.So evil a fpirit that haunts a poor maid,By the grave fons of phyfic can never be laid ;If a youth vers’d in magic would take me in hand,I’m lure of a cure, if he waves but his wand.In vain I perplex my poor fancy, &c.A young Oxford fcholar knows well my fad cafe,For he look’d in my eyes, and read over my face;So learned he talk’d, that I felt at my heart.He mull have great {kill in "the magical art.In vain I perplex my poor fancy, See.O fend for this fcholar, and let him preferibe,He’ll do me more good than the medical tribe:Then the rofe with the lily again fhall appear,And my heart, now fo heavy, dance thro’ the whole year.No more I’ll perplex my poor fancy,To find out the grief,For he’ll foon brir« relief,Heigh ho!

ARRIED MAN.To its own proper Tune.IAm married, and happy ; with wonder hear this,ye rovers and rakes of the age,Who laug^ at the motion of conjugal blifs,and who only loofe pleafures engage.( 8 )You maylaugh; but, believe me, yoa’re all inthevvrong,when you merrily marriage deride ;For to marriage the permanent pleafures belong,and in them we can only confide.The joys which from lawlefs connexions arife,are fugitive-^-never fincere ;Oft ftolen with hafle, or fnatch’d by furpr’ae,interrupted by doubts, and by fear.But thofe which in legal attachments we find,when the heart is with innocence pure,Is from ev’ry imbitt’ring refleXion refin’d,and to life’s lateft hour will endure.The life which you boaft of, deferves not that name,true love is with fentiment join’d ;But yours is a paffion, a feverifii flame,rais’d without the confent of the mind.AVhen, dreading confinement, ye miflreffes hire,with this, and with that ye are cloy’d ;Ye are led, and milled, by a flatt’ring falfe fire,and are oft by that lire defiroy’d.If you afle me from w'.mce my felicity flows,roy anfwer is Ihort—“ From a Wife,Who for chearfulnefs, fenfe, and good nature I chofe,which are beauties that charm us for life.”To make home the feat of perpetual delight,ev’ry hour each fludies to feiz£;And we find ourfelves happy from morning to nightby our mutual endeavours to pleafe.F I N r S.

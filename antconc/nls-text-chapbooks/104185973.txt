side,And fragrance fill’d the valeBy far the sweetest flower there,Was the Rose of Allandale.Where’er I wander’d east or west;Though fate began to low’r—A solace still was she to me,In sorrow’s lonely hour.When tempests lash’d our gallant b&riCtAnd rent her shiv’ring sail—One maiden form withstood the storm,’Twas the Rose of Allandale.And when my fever’d lips were parofo’d,On Afric’s Doming sand.She whisper’d hopes of happiness,And tales of distant land.My life had been a wilderness.Unbliss’d by fortune’s gale—Had fate not link'd my lot to hers,'rv'e Rose of Allandal"V4HEAVING THE LEAD.For England, when, with fav'ring gale,Our gallant ship up channel steer’d,And scudding under easy sail,The high blue western land appear’d,To heave the lead the seaman sprung,And to the ' ’ ’But bearing up to gain the port,Some well-known object kept in view—An abbey-tow’r, an harbour-fort,Or beacon, to the vessel true ;While oft the lead the seaman flung,And to the pilot cheerly sung,And as the much-lov’d shore wo near,With transports we behold the roofWhere dwells a friend or partner dear,Of faith and love a matchless proof:The lead once more the seaman dung,And to the watchful pilot sung,Now to her berth the ship draws nigh.With slacken’d sail she feels the tide;Btand clear the cable! is the cry—The anchor’s gone, we safely ride,The watch is set, and thro’ the night,We hear the seamen with delight,Come, cheer up, my lads, ’tis to glory we steer,To add something new to this wonderful year ;To honour we call you, not press you like slaves,For who are so free as the sons of the

wi’ a braw new gown,Came o’er the hill to Gowrie.The rose-bud ting’d Wi’ morning showers,Bloom’d fresh within the sunny bowers,But Kitty was the fairest flowerThat ever bloom’d in Gowrie.I had nae thought to do her wrang,But round her waist my arms I flangAnd said, “ My lassie, will ye gangTo view the Carse o’ Gowrie?”I’ll take ye to my father’s ha’In yon green field beside the shaw.And make

*Far, far to foreign lands I stray,To spend the hours in deepest wae.Farewell my dear and native soil.Farewell, the braes o’ Aberfoyle.And fare ye well my winsome love,Into whatever lands I rove,ThouTt claim the deepest, dearest sigh,The warmest tear e’er wet my eye ;And when I’m wand’ring many a mile,I’ll think on Kate o’ Aberfoyle.When far upon the raging sea,While thunders roll and lightnings fiee,When sweeping storms the ship assail.I’ll bless the music of the gale!And when I’m listning a’ the while.I’ll think on Kate o’ Aberfoyle.Katy, my only love, farewell;What pangs my faithful heart shall feel,While straying through the Indian grovss,Weeping our waes, cur early loves:I’ll ne’er mair see my native soil,Farewell, farewell, sweet Abeifoyle.• J lMY DEAR HIGHLAND

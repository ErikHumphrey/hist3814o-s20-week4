Having to call at ourgrocer’s shop, I found him enquiring of a poorwoman after the health of her son. In a plaintivevoied she replied, “ He is very ill;—he cannotcontinue long ;—he is my only child, and when Ihave lost him, I have lost all 1” Instantly I felt astrong desire to visit him, and with some difficultyobtained permission. I found him in a wretchedhabitation, seated in an easy chair, panting forbreath, in the last stage of a consumption: heappeared to be about twenty-two years of age.I addressed him as follows : “ Young man, Iam sorry to see you so ill.” He said, “ I am illindeed sir ; but it will not be long ;—I shall soonbe released,—I hope I shall soon be in heaven.”“ I am glad {I added) to hear of your willingnessto die and of your hope of heaven : have you ascriptural foundation for your, hope ?” As he madeno reply, and thinking he did not understand me,I said, c' You know, my friend, there are manydie who do not go to heaven : for God saith,‘ The wicked shall be turned into hell, with allthe people that forget God.’ Before we can beadmitted into heaven, we must repent of ourwicked lives, and obtain a pardon of all our sins.Save you repented, and been forgiven ?” Hecould contain himself no longer, but turned withindignation tp his mother and said, “What didyou bring this fellow here for ?” Then turning3to me, he said, “ Man, go about your businessI did not send for you, nor do I want you : youdo me no good: surely my sufferings are great■enough, and you distress rue exceedingly.” Themore I endeavoured to pacify him, the more hisanger kindled against me. I-therefore sat, andsilently lifted up my heart to God for wisdom todirect me. It appeared as if I had no possibilityof success, unless I could obtain consent to situp with him all night. I asked, entreated, andwould not be denied : I told them what an excel¬lent nurse I was, and I hoped we should have acomfortable night: if they pleased I would gohome and fetch some currant-jelly, and otherthings proper for a person in his situation ;—thatI would bring some refreshment for myself, thatI might be no expence to them ;—that a night ofsound sleep would refresh the old mother, whoseemed almost w orn out—That I would instruct"him in the best manner I was able ;—and that ifthere were a change for death, I w ould awakethe mother, that she might see her son die, &c.&c. Taking it for granted I had prevailed, 1hastened home, and returned as soon as possible,and found they had not locked me out.The young man received me with sullen silence.After some conversation, I prevailed upon themother to go to bed. As the young man was1 not able to lie down, he remained in his largechair day and night. I told him I had brought•. a Bible with me, and if he pleased I would readIto him, to which he consented. After I hadprayed, I read and expounded those parts whichwere applicable to his state. “ What! (he said)you are beginning again ; you certainly will killme : it does so hurt me to talk—Oh that mymother was but here !” I said, “ My dear child'you do not need to talk: I won’t ask you one4question, and I bt;g you will not speak, and I willpray and read.", 1 kneeled down and prayed again,but with little expectation. Then I opened theprecious word of life' and alternately rend, ex¬pounded, and applied; when I saw his passionrising, X begged he would not speak, lor thatwould hurt him.We spent our time in this way for some hours,till at length under prayer, I heard him feeblysay Amen to my petitions ; which inspired mewith fresh courage to persevere. When I arose,I spoke to him more closely, with all tenderness,concerning his sin and danger. Now he openedhis mouth, and brake the. snare of the Devii. Hetold me he was the son of a pious Methodist class-leader, who many years ago had passed into theheavens. I felt confident that the father’s manyprayers must be answered. Now I kneeled down,and asked God in faith, nothing doubting : I heardthe young man repeating my petitions word forword: I instantly personated a poor .lost sinneron the brink of eternity, and on the, verge of hell,vet, through the infinite- merits ot Jesus Christ,suing for piercy. Then I cried, “ God be mer¬ciful to me a sinner,—Jesus died for me ; for hissake alone forgive vie, but let it be just now.”We both prayed harden and louder, till we prayedwith all our might.When we prose from our knees, (for I foundhe had dropped upon his during the last prayer,)he walked over the room, and leaning his headagainst the wall, he said, “O God,) 1 .thou wiltgive me a little ease and strength, 1 will pray aswell as I can.” Immediately he turned to me,and said, “ I have no pain : it is all gong!” Hethen poured out his soul’in strong cries and tears,and his body shook like a leal in the wmd.Considering his state ol weakness, it is astonish-5ing he did not faint. I encouraged him to takeno thought for his body, but by faith to plead theblood of the covenant. His importunity increas¬ed, till he made a sudden pause, and turning tome, he said, “ I am happy ! O how happy ! blessthe Lord ! blessed he my God !” And he praisedGod, in language which astonished me.He was so filled with the love of God, that he| opened the door and walked into the street , thoughl| he had not been able to stand for some time with-opt assistance. Accents of praise to the mosthigh God filled the air, in the solemn silence ofthe night. He said, “ O ye angels join with meto praise the Lord ! The dead’s alive, the prodi¬gal is found ! Glory be to God for ever. Oh !the matchless mercy of God, to savt/me at thisi latest hour,” &c. &c.This was a memorable night: what a contrastbetween the former and the latter part of it. Inthe beginning, devils were raging within him, un¬willing to lose their prey ; in the after-part of thenight, angels were rejoicing over another sinnersaved by grace. I sang several hymns of praise to1 God, and we conversed as brethren in the Lord,and fellow-citizens of heaven : we eat the bread; of life, and antedated the joys above. When his: mother came down stairs in the morning, she wasstruck with astonishment to hear her son praiseGod. He said, “ If God had not sent this hisservant to visit me, I should have been damnedfor ever. The Lord lias pardoned all my sins. Iam so happy I cannot describe it—Glory be toGod for ever,” &c. He continued a few days,faithfully warning his friends and acquaintance toflee from the wrath to come, magnifying theboundless grace of God as manifested in him, andthen triumphantly departed this life, in sure andcertain hope of a glorious resurrection.i6The Conversion of a Poor Woman nearManchester.A poor woman that lived about ten miles fromManchester, hearing some say “ We have beenthere and have found the Lord.” told it to aneighbour, and said, “ I wish I could go to Man¬chester and find the Lord.” Her neighbour said“ then why do you not go?” She replied “ Ihave got no shoes 1” Her neighbour answered,“ I will lend you mine." She said “ then I willgo.” She accordingly went to Manchester, butknew not where to go ; seeing a gentleman in themarket-place, she asked him, “ where is it thatpeople goto find the Lord ?” He said, “ amongthe Methodists, as far as I know.” She asked,“ where are they 7" He answered, “ come andI will shew you.” He brought her to the pas¬sage which led to the Chapel, and said, “go inthere.” A person came to her and asked whatshe wanted ? She said, “ is this the place wherethe people find.the Lord ?” One of the membersthen came (John Morris,) and having heard hersimple relation of the cause of her coming, hetook her into the chapel, and placed her near themiddle of the room, and advised her to look atnone but the preacher. She took his advice,and about the middle of the sermon she exclaim¬ed, “ glory be to God, I have found the LordWhich she repeated over and over, being filedwith joy unspeakable.—C. Atmorc's Memorial.The remarkable conversion of tivo wicked Men atConglctm in Cheshire.David and Samuel were pot-companions; Davidmade it his business to stand in the street nearthe time of preaching, and swear at the people as7they were going to it. About this time ther£ wereseveral remarkable conversions. At this Davidseemed much perplexed, and asked Samuel,* What can this be ? What is it they do to thepeople to convert them ? I have a good mind t«go and see.” Accordingly they both went tohear Mr. Furze preach ; but after they had satabout a quarter of an hour, David started up andsaid, “ I will stay here no longer.” He attempt¬ed to run, but quickly dropped down : howeverhe rose, and with some difficulty got home. Hewent straight to his chamber and got to bed : heturned a few times, and then leaped up and said,“ I will lie here no longer.” He ran into thefields, and there wandered all the night. In themorning he came home, went into his shop, andthought he would go to work. He heated hisiron in the forge, and lifted up his hammer overhis head; but he imagined Satan was just behindhim, and ready to carry him away. He imme¬diately let fall his hammer, ran out of the shop,and wandered in the fields all the day. In theevening a farmer saw him, and said, “ David,why are you not at your work ?” He answered“ I think I shall work no more.” The farmerasked, “ Why so ?” he said, “ I am afraid I shallbe converted.” It quickly spread through thetown that David was going to be converted. ButDavid protested he would not! And in order toprevent it he would go and get drunk directly !He accordingly went and drank two quarts ofale, and half a pint of brandy ! He was nowraging mad, after knocking down several persons,and destroying the furniture in the public-house,he went home ; but be now thought Satan wouldsurely have him ; he therefore took to his heelsand ran into the fields, where he spent the day.At last he went to Samuel and said, “ Ever since1 heard that oid man preach I can neither catnor sleep.” Then said Samuel, ‘f Take it fur awarping, or I will keep thy company no more.”David said, “ What shall we do ?” Samuel an¬swered, “ Whatever thou doest, I will join thesociety.” David fell a weeping, and said, “ Ifthou doest, so will I, if they will have me." Assoon as their design was known, several personswent to Mr. Furze, and desired he would not re¬ceive them. A little before the time of preach¬ing they came, and Samuel said to Mr. Furze,“ We are two desperate wicked men ; but wewant to be better. And we beg. you, for Christ’ssake to receive us into your society.” lie re¬plied, “ Yes, for Christ’s sake, I will receiveyou.” They looked one at another with tjjarsflowing from their eyes, and said, “ For Chest’ssake to receive us now, and let us go to the Love-feast.” Mr. Furze answered, “I do receive younow for Christ’s sake.” After preaching, Davidwas observed be in great distress ; his qriesand groans were such as struck terror ipto allwho were near him. Mr. Furze kueeied. downand prayed for him, ami while he was praying,David started up and cried aioiul, “ Glory be toGod, my sins are forgiven !” At the same timeSamuel said, “ O precious Lamb of God ! all ina gore, of blood for me!” David th'ep brokethrougji the people and caught Samuel in hisafnis/ sajipg; Come let. us sing the Virgin'Many's..song together : I could neyerjmig ic be¬fore ; but now ‘ My soul $otq magnify the.Xord-and my spirit doth rejoice in God my Sgvidur !An Infidel Converted id a Miisiovary.Tun Rev.

The links of thechain of Proyideneq.are wonderfully connected:an infidel ridicules—,a believer admires and adores!'The following i^g story that can be authenti¬cated by t'ne eyideqep of m a Ay who have, heard itfrom,the person who is the subject of it, but nowgone safe, to God and glory. “ When the Itev.Mr. to. his living in the country, a verygreat audience collected from the neighbouringtowns and villages,j in one of which lived an oldinnkeeper, who having made free with his owntap, had well carbuncle^ his nose and face, whiuhbore the visible marks of his profession. lie hadheard the report of the concourse at this churchy,as many went from his own town ; but he alwaysstoutly swore he would never be found among thefools who wrere running to turn Methodists. In-deed it was equally contradictory to his practice,as well as profession, to be found among thos«who followed the gospel of Christ; but on hear¬ing the particularly pleasing mode of singing atchurch, which >vas much spoken of, his curiositywas excited, and he said he did not know butwhen next P—n-feast came, which was half way,he might go and hear the singing ; but not w ith¬out some imprecation, that he would never heara woid of the sermon.He lived about six miles distant, and whenP—n-feast came, dining with a party, instead ofsitting to drink he came to the afternoon service,merely to hear the singing at the church, with afull resoli.tm- Jr^nintr his vow> aluJ eXciduin''every word of the sermon.He was a large fat man, and it was a hot sum¬mer’s day, he came in sweating and wiping, andhaving with difficulty found admission into a nar¬row open pew, with a lid, as soon as the hymnbefore sermon was sung, which he heard withgreat attention, he leaned forward, and fixing hiselbows on the lid, secured both his ears againstthe sermon with his fore fingers. He had notbeen in this position many minutes before theprayer finished, and the sermon commenced, withan awful appeal to the consciences of the hearers,of the necessity of attending to the things whichmake for their everlasting peace ; and the mini¬ster addressing them solemnly, “ He that hathcars to hear let him ear.” Just the moment be¬fore these words w’ere pronounced, a fly had fas¬tened on the carbuncled nose of the Inn keeper,and stinging him sharply, he snatched one of hisfingers from his ear and struck of? the painful vi-IIsltanf, at that very moment the words, “ FTe thathath ears to hear let him hear," (pronounced withgreat solemnity) entered the ear that was opened,as a clap of thunder. It struck him with irresist¬ible force, he kept his hand from returning to liisear, and feeling an impression he had neverknown before, he presently withdrew the otherfinger and harkened with deep attention to thediscourse which followed.That day was the beginning of days to him;from that moment a change was produced uponhim which could not but be noticed by all his for¬mer companions he never from that day return¬ed to any of his former practices; never after¬wards was seen in liquor, or heard to swear ; be¬gan to pray and hear God’s word ; for many yearswalked, all weathers, six miles to the churchwhere he received the first knowledge of a dyingRedeemer and salvation through his name ; andafter about eighteen years faithful and close walkwith God, he died in the rejoicing of hops,and blessed him who sent, the meanest of his crea¬tures to open his ears to instruction.”—(January5th. 1796.—/.

The word preached did notprofit him, not being mixed with faith. In thisdreadful situation was he, when, on the 10th ofMarch 1790, his wife died, after bringing intothe world an infant daughter.The good providence of that gracious' God,who callcth the weak things of this world to con-found the strong, had ordained that the nurse oftins child should be a woman of exemplary faith,who 4 4 Wi.il 1 ied in the Spirit, being sanctified bythe Holy Ghost.1’ The carnal mind of the Fa¬ther still continued at “ enmity with God,” bathe was ere long to be brought to a conviction ofbis own unworihingss, and a delightful experienceof the riches of redeeming love. The child beingnow about twenty months old, and ^eginqiag toprattle a few words; was one day seijt'for by thefather, who was sitting after dinner with some ofhis profane acquaintances.; to.his great astonish¬ment, the child repeated two or three times, inits infant tone, “ 0 ,the-'Griice of God ! I”- Thesewords made a deep impression upon the father :he began to reflect upon his sins, and the powerof that grace “ which , cleansetfi from sin,” solong the subject of bis impious ridicule. TheHoly Ghost luid “ opened his heart,” and nowbrought him, like a sheep that had been, astray,unto the fold of divine love. Since that time hehas ever walked as becometh one called in theLord, “ bringing forth fruits meet tor renentan'cel”The .words winch through the grace of (Tod, be¬came the happy instrument of his conversion,,.were the customary ejaculations of bis piousnurse, and had tbus been learned by the infayir.So truly wa% the Scripture verified, that (1 out ofthe mouths of babes .and suckling's the Lord hasordained praiisp.”Free-fririce exemplified in the Conversion of rtv; ^. Thif.A notorious’ robber iu Scotland, known ir,the n me of J’oha-of-tlie-Score, happening 1 tomeet with a poor man travelling with two horses,forcibly took them both away, regardlesc of theintreaties of the distressed countryman, who fa.!-ling on his knees, begged him for Jesu* Chrirf'ssaJce to restore one of them, as the maintenanceof his family was depending on his horses.The thief having returned home became fromthat day dull and melancholy, unable to rest athome or pursue his depredations abroad, forwhich he could assign no cause but tin’s, that thewords which the poor man had uttered concern¬ing Jesus Christ, (which, by the way, he was soignorant Jas not to understand,) laid like a heavyweight upon his spirit. Desiring therefore hissons to shift for themselves, and secretly re¬fraining from attempting to escape or hide him¬self, he was apprehended by the ministers of jus¬tice, imprisoned in Edinburgh, tried, and con¬demned to die.Being visited by the Rev. Mr. Blyth and a Mr.Cunningham, who had formerly known him, hewas exhorted to consider his miserable and dan¬gerous condition as a dying sinner, and to fly foryefuge to Jesus Cnrist. xieanhg that name hesuddenly cried out, “ Oh what word is that forit has been my death ? That is the word that haslain upon my heart ever since the poor man men¬tioned it, so that 1 had no power to escape.” Theminister took occasion to preach to him Jesus asthe only and all-sufficient Saviour. But will he,said the relenting thief, "’ill he ever look uponme, will he ever shew mercy to me, who wouldnot for his sake shew mercy to that poor man, ingiving him buck his horse.After further instructions a real and most gra¬cious change appeared in him, of which he dis¬covered the most convincing evidence: he attain¬ed to a happy assurance of his interest in Christ,and on the scaffold, where he suffered, spoke sowonderfully of the Lord’s dealings with him, asjeft a conviction on the spectators, and forcedn f         lem to acknowledge a glorious truth and reality) the grace of God.—(Evangelical Magazine.)The Conversion of a Libertine.A certain libertine, of a most abandoneduiracter, happened accidentally to stroll into alurch, where he heard the fifth chapter of Ge-;sis read ; importing that so long lived such1 trsons, and yet the conclusion was “ they died.”nos lived 905 years and he died—Seth, 912 and2 died—Methuselah, 9f>9 and he died. The• jlpquent repetitions of the words he died, not-(ithstanding the great length of years they had''ed, struck him so deeply with the thought of?ath and eternity, that through divine grace, hecame a most exemplar}' Christian.3 i , •' _ tConversion of a Father by means of a child.I The father of the Rev.

HisTe a serious Christian, one day called the familyagether, and engaged young Baiiy, then a child,it remarkable for piety, to pray with them. Thether being informod in what a wonderful way.s son had prayed, was struck with a deep con¬ation, which proved the beginning of his con-rsion to God : so that he became one of thenst eminent Christians in the neighbourhood!iere he lived—(Lancashire.) He would some-nes retire with his child in his hand to theenes of his former wickedness, and there pourt floods of tears in prayer before the Lord.Anecdote of Mr. Guthrie.The iate Mr. Guthrie, of Fenwick, when rid¬ing in the county of Angus, happened to lose liisway in a moor, and after wandering •'awhile, be¬came to a cottage where a poor man was .dyirfgJUpon, coming into the house he' found a carnalminister endeavouring to comfort the poor manfrom the consideration ofhis own works, and notfrom the free grace and righteousness of the .Lord Jesus.

My mind was instantly solemnized. I could not laugh : my attention was riviteeon the preacher. I heard prayer and sermon wit!an impression very different from what had carried me into the chapel.—From that moment tingospel truths penetrated my heart. I joined thcongregation, and cried to God in Christ fomercy, and found peace in believing ; becammy mother’s comfort as I had long been her heavy cross ; and through grace have ever since continued in the good ways of the Lord.

Freaching once at Warborough, near Oxford, a man was so much affected with his firsprayer, that he ran home, and desired his wife t>idget ready, and come to church, for there wasone in the pulpit who prayed like an angel. Thewoman hastened away and heard the sermon,which, under the divine blessing, proved themeans of her conversion, and she afterwardsproved an eminent Christian.The Conversion of a poor woman near Bath.I was well acquainted with a pious woman,who died in Bath, about the year ITTi, who was•brought to the saving knowledge of God, in thefollowing remarkable manner. She lived in thecountry and was left a widow, with several chil¬dren, who were all taken ill of the small pox atthe same time. Being in deep poverty, and dis¬tress, especially while her children were underthat affliction, a Quaker-woman one day rode upto her door and said, “ Art not thou a poor wi¬dow and in great distress?” The woman an¬swered, “yes, I am a widow and in distressenough.” She then gave her a little money, andsaid, I am a stranger to thee, but as I was rid-I ing along the road, the Lord inclined me to callat thy house, and to relieve thee.” She thenrode away, and the woman saw her no more.Some time after this she came and lived at Mash-field, where the travelling preachers were enter¬tained by one John Ranger, a truly pious youngman, he being visited by affliction got this poorwoman to attend him in his sickness. One dayj as she was sitting by the bed-side, he beingasleep she fell asleep also, and dreamed thatJohn Ranger said to her with great earnestness:1“ awake thou that sleepest, and arise from thedead and Christ shall give thee light.”—She im¬mediately awoke out of her sleep and could hard¬ly be persuaded but that John Ranger had really.spoke those words to her. However they had a20blessed effect on her lyind. She was awakenedfrom the deep sleep of sin, and sought the Lordwith her whole heart. About a week after thisshe again fell asleep while sitting by the sickman, and dreamed that John gave out and sungDr. Watt’s hymn,• Come, Holy Spirit, heavenly Dove,’ &c,>and while he was singing, the Lord spoke peaceto her spul, and she awoke full of peace and joy.I preached at Mashfiyld the followh 0 Sunday,and not knowing any thing of this, I happenedto give out, before the sermon, the above'hymn,which very much affected her mind. John Ran¬ger died happy in the Lord, and the preachingwas removed from Mashfield. On this account,the poor woman removed to Rath, as she couldnot live without the gospel. Here she got herbread by attending the sick, as a nurse for someyears, and walking humbly and comfortably withGod. I visited her in her last sickness and foundher solidly happy in the enjoyment of close com¬munion with God. She lived alone, and had noone to attend her in her affliction except someof her kind neighbours might occasional!}' lookin' upon her ; and she had nothing to support herunless what might be now and then given her incharity. And although she was alone night andday, she was perfectly satisfied. I took the lateMr. Wesley to see her, wno after talking andpraying with her, would have given her a littlemoney, but she refused to take it. saying, “I amunable to take any tiling but a small bit of breadsteeped in cold water, and therefore I want no¬thing.” Thus lived, and thus died this poor, butexceeding happy woman.—f John Paivfon.)21■W-* W-V^.

A pious young woman, aservant in the neighbourhood, felt a deep concernfor the salvation of this man, and set herself toinvent some method to promote it. She invitedanother serious young woman to accompany herto his house, in the evening, when they offeredtheir services to sit up with the sick man ; whichoffer was thankfully accepted. When the rest ofthe family had retired to their beds, and all wasstill, the young woman, first mentioned, addressedthe dying man in the most solemn manner res¬pecting the state of his soul, and the in •mrtantconcerns of eternity ; after which they asked hispermission to pray with him.—He consented ;—and while she, with uncommon enlargement,poured out her soul in his behalf, the Spirit ofGod powerfully affect#d the poor man’s heart,convinced him of his lost and ruined state, andded him cordially to embrace Jesus Christ and his(great salvation, as exactly suited to his condition.[file rest of the night was employed in spiritualconversation and ferventY>rayer.

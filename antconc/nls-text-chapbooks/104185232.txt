He must have strange terms, and emphati-cal words, to grace and adorn his actions ; and themore to amaze and astonish the beholders,3. And lastly. He must use such gestures ofbody, as may take off the spectators’ eyes froma strict and diligent beholding his manner of per¬formance.The Card burnt, and afterwards foundin a Watch.One of the company draws a chance card, andyou ask for three watches from the spectators,which you fold up in separate pieces of paper inin the form of dice boxes, which are laid on thetable, and covered with a napkin—the card chosenis burnt, and the cinders put into a box—shortlyafter the box is opened, the ashes are not there.4The three watches are put on a plate, and someone of the company chooses one, the same per¬son opens the watch, and finds under the glass apiece of the burnt card: and in the watch-case,under the watch, is found a miniature card, resem¬bling the one burnt.Explanation.The card chosen is known by tne arrangementwe have explained. The watches are placed,well covered with paper, on a little trap : the trapis described in the cutting, tearing, and mendinga handkerchief. When you have made known tothe confederate the card which is chosen, hestretches his arm to the table to take one of thewatches, and deposit there what is requisite; thewatches must be covered with a napkin, which issupported by bottles, or somewhat else, otherwisethe hand of the confederate would be seen, orthe napkin would be seen to move. As for themeans employed to cause the ashes of the burntcard to disappear in the box, it consists in puttinginto the cover a piece of wood or paper which ex¬actly fits it, and falls down to the bottom whenthe box is shut; this piece of wood or paper be¬ing at the same colour as the inside of the box,operates as a double bottom, and hides the ashesfrom the view of the deceived spectator, who atthat minute is tempted to believe that the ashesare gone out to be combined afresh, and to pro-5dace the miniature card which is found in thewatch.How to cut a Man’s Head ©ff, and put thdHead into a plate a yard from his Body.This is a noble action if it be handled by a skil¬ful hand. To show this feat of execution youmust cause a board, a cloth, and a plate to bepurposely made, and in each of them to be madeholes fit for a boy’s neck: the broad must bemade of two planks, the longer and broader thebetter; there must be left within half a yard ofthe end of each plank, half a hole, so as both theplanks being thrust together, there may remaintwo holes like the holes in a pair of stocks ; theremust be made likewise a hole in the cloth, a platealso must be set directly over or upon one ofthem, having a hole in the middle thereof, of thelike quantity, and also a piece cut off the sameas big as his neck, through which his head maybe conveyed into the middle of the plate and thensitting or kneeling under the board, let the headonly remain upon the board, in the frame, thento make the sight more dreadful put a little brim¬stone into a chafing-dish of,coals, setting it be¬fore the head of the boy, who must gasp two orthree times so as the smoke may enter his nos¬trils and mouth, which is not unwholesome, andthe head presently will appear stark dead, if theboy set his countenance accordingly; and if a0little blood be sprinkled on his face the sight willbe stranger. This is commonly with a boy in¬structed for that purpose, who being familiar andconversant with company, may be known as wellby his face as by his apparel. In the other endof the table, where the like hole is made, anotherboy of the bigness of the known boy must beplaced, having on his usual apparel: he must leanor lie upon the board, and must put his head un¬der the board, through the side hole, so as thebody shall seem to lie on the end of the board,and his head lie in a plate on the other end.There are other things which might be performedin this action, the more to astonish the beholders,which, because they require long descriptions, Iomit; as to put about his neck a little doughkneaded with bullock’s blood, which, being cold,will appear like dead flesh, and being prickedwith a sharp round hollow quill will bleed andseem very strange; and many rules are to be ob¬served herein, as to have the table-cloth so longand so wide as it may almost reach the ground Note, suffer not the company to stay too long inthe place.Dancing Egg.Three eggs are brought out, two of them areput on a table, and the third in a hat: a littlecane is borrowed from one of the company, andit is shown about to convince the spectators that/there is no preparation. It is then placed acrossthe hat, the hat falls to the ground and the eggsticks to it as if glued, the orchestra then playsa piece of music, and the egg, as if it was sensi¬ble of the harmony, twists about the cane fromone end to the other, and continues its motiontill the music stops.Explanation,The egg is fastened to a thread by a pin, whichis put in lengthways, and the hole, which hasbeen made to introduce the pin, is stopped withwhite wax. The other end of the thread is fas¬tened to the breast of the person who performsthe trick, with a pin bent like a hook—the canepassing under the thread near to the egg servesfor it to rest on—when the music begins, theperformer pushes the cane from left to right, orfrom right to left; it then appears as if the eggran along the cane, which it does not, being fas¬tened to its thread, its centre of gravity remainsalways at the same distance from the hook thatholds it; it is the cane which sliding along pre¬sents its different points to the surface of the egg. N.B. To produce the illusion, and persuadethe company that it is the egg which carries it¬self toward the different points of the cane, theperformer turns a little on his heel, by this meansthe egg receives a motion which deceives the8spectators, it remaining’ always at the same dis¬tance from the point to which it is fastened.Dancing Egg.Boil an egg hard, and peel of a small piece ofthe shell at one end; then thrust in a quill filledwith quicksilver, and sealed at each end. Aslong as the egg remains warm, it will not ceaseto dance about.The Fascinated Bird.Take any bird, and lay it on a table; thenwave a small feather over its eyes, and it will ap¬pear as dead, but taking the feather away, it willrevive again. Let it lay hold of the stem partif the feather, and it will twist ami turn like aparrot; you may likewise roll it about, on thetable just as you please.Enchanted Cock.Bring a cock into a room, with both yourhands close to his wings, and hold them tight;put him on a table, and point his beak down asstraight as possible ; then let any one draw a line,with a piece of chalk, directly from its beak, andall the noise you can possibly make will you dis¬turb him, for some time, from the seeming leth-argy, which thet position you have laid him inhas effected.To Make a Sixpence leap out of a Pot.This is done by means of a long horse-hair,fastened to the rim of a sixpence, by a small hole9driven through it. This feat should be done bynight, with a candle placed between the specta¬tors and operator, their eyes being thereby hin¬dered from discerning the deception.Magic Spoon.Put four ounces of bisbuth into a crucible, andwhen in a state of complete fusion, throw in twoounces and a half of lead, and one ounce and ahalf of tin : these metals will combine, and forman alloy fusible in boiling water. Mould the al¬loy into bars, and take them to a silversmith tobe made into teaspoons. Place one of them in asaucer, at a tea-table, and the person who uses itwill not be a little astonished to find it melt awayas soon as he puts it into the hot tea.The Paper Oracle.Some amusement may be obtained amongyoung people, by writing with common ink, avariety of questions, on different bits of paper,and adding a pertinent reply to each, written withnitro-muriat of gold. The collection is sufferedto dry, and put aside till an opportunity offersfor using them. When produced, the answerswill be invisible; you desire different persons toselect such questions as they may fancy, and takethem home with them; you then promise, thatif they are placed near the fire during the night,answers will appear beneath the questions in the10morning; and such will be fact, if the papers bebe put in any dry, warm situation.The Cut Lace joined.Conceal a piece of lace in your hand ; thenproduce another piece of the same pattern; dou¬ble the latter, and put the fold between yourfore-finger and thumb, with the piece which youhave concealed, doubled in the same manner;pull out a little of the latter, so as to make aloop, and desire one of the company to cut it as¬under. If you have conveyed the concealed pieceof lace, so dexterously as to be undetected, withthe other between your thumb and fore-finger,the spectators will, naturally enough, think youhave really cut the latter : which you may seemto ma'ke whole again, while repeating some con¬juring words, and putting away the two ends ofthe piece that is actually cut.How TO SUSPEND A IllNG WITH A BURNTTHREAD.The thread having been previously soaked twoor three times in common salt and water, tie itto a ring not larger than a wedding-ring. Whenyou apply the flame of a candle to it, thoughthe thread burn to ashes, it will yet sustain thering.A whimsical, trick.Take salt-petre an ounce, cream of Tartar anounce, sulphur half an ounce, beat them to poiv-11der singly, then mix them together, and put thepowder in a paper in your pocket, you may thenat any time you please, convey a grain into apipe of tobacco, and when it takes fire it will givethe report of a musket, but not break the pipe;or you may put as much as will lay upon yournail in any place, upon little bits of paper, andsetting fire to it, there will be the report of somany great guns, but it will not produce any badeffect.To TELL A CARD THOUGHT OF BLINDFOLD.Take twenty-on cards, and lay them down inthree rows, with their faces upward; (he.) whenyou have laid out three, begin again at the lefthand, and lay one card upon the first, and so onto the right hand ; then begin on the left handagain, and so go on until you have laid out thetwenty-one cards in three heaps at the same timerequesting any one to think of a card. Whenyou have laid them out ask him which heap hiscard is in: then lay that heap in the middle be¬tween the other two. This done, lay them outagain in three heaps as before, and again requesthim to notice where his noted card goes, and putthat heap in the middle as before. Then takingup the cards with their backs toward you, takeoff the uppermost card, and reckon it one ; takeoff another, which reckon, two ; and thus proceedtill you come to the eleventh, which will invari-112ably prove to be the card thought of. You mustnever lay out your cards less than three times,but as often above that number as you please.This trick may be done with-out your seeing thecards at all, if you handle and count them care¬fully. To diversify the trick, you may use adifferent number ot cards, but the number chosenmust be divisible by three, and the middle card,after they have been thrice dealt as directed, willalways be the one thought of; for instance, ifdone with fifteen cards, it must be the eighth,and so on ; when the number is even, it must bethe exact half; as if it be twenty-four, the cardthought of will be the twelfth, &c.To WRITE ANY NAME UPON A PAPER, AND THENBURN IT TO ASHES, YET AFTERWARDS IT MAYBE READ PLAINLY.Take a new clean pen that was never writwith, and dip in your own water as you do ink,then strip up your shirt sleeve above your wrist,and upon your arm write your name, or any mark,and then let it dry on your skin, and nothingwill be seen, then put down your sleeve and but¬ton your wrist; do this privately, and it will causesome wonder; then take a piece of white paperand write your name, or the mark thereon withanother pen of black ink (but let it be written aslike the other as you can) then take the paperand burn it, and lay the ashes on a table, and13stripping up your sleeve, rub the ashes hardwith your finger, where you had written withyour water, then blow oil’the ashes, and the nameor mark will plainly be read on your arm in blackletters.The Sentinel EggLay a looking-glass upon an even table ; takea fresh egg, and shake it for some time, so thatthe yoke may be broken and mixed up with thewhite. You may then, with a steady hand, bal¬ance it on its point, and make it stand on the glass.This it would be impossible to do while the eggwas in its natural state.How to blow a Sixpence out of anotherMan’s Hand.Take a sixpence, blow on it, and clap it pre¬sently into one ol your spectator’s hands, biddinghim to hold it fast; then ask of him if he be surehe have it; then to be certain he will open hishand and look.. Then say to him, “ Nay, butif you let my breath go off, I cannot do it.”Then take it out of his hand again, and blow onit, and, staring him in the face, clap a piece ofhorn in his hand, and retain the sixpence, shut¬ting his hand, yourself. Bid him hold his handdown, and slip the tester between one of his cuffs.Then take the stone you show feats with, andhold it unto his hand, saying, “ By virtue hereof1 will command the money to vanish you hold in14your hand; vade, now see.” When they havelooked, then they will think it is changed by vir¬tue of your stone. Then take the horn again ;and seem to cast it from you, retaining it, andsay, ‘ Vade !’ and anon say, ‘ you have, your mon¬ey again.’ He then will begin to marvel, andsay, “ I have notsay then to him again, youhave, and I am sure you have it; Is it not inyour hand ? If it be not there, turn down one ofyour sleeves, for it is in one I am sure; where hefinding it, will not a little wonder.Mysterious Bottle.Pierce a few holes, with a glazier’s diamond,in a common black bottle; place it in a vase or ajug of water, so that the neck only is above thesurface. Then, with a funnel, fill the bottle, andcork it well, while it is in the jug or vase. Takeit out, and notwithstanding the holes in the bot¬tom, it will not leak; wipe it dry, and give it tosome person to uncork. 4 he moment the corkis drawn to the party’s astonishment, the waterwill begin to run out of the bottom of the bot¬tle.Money Box.A piece of money, or a ring, is put into a box,in the presence of a person who holds it; the oper¬ator stands at a distance, and bids him shake thebox gently, and the piece is heard to rattle in¬side ; he is desired again to shake it, and then itis noc heard to rattle; the third time it is againheard, but the fourth time it is gone, and is foundin the shoe of one of the company.The box must be made on purpose, in such amanner that in shaking it gently up and down,the piece within is heard; on the contrary, shak¬ing it hard, horizontally, a little spring, whichfalls on the piece, prevents it from being heard,which makes you imagine it is not within. Hewho performs the trick, then touches the box,under pretence of showing how to shake it, andalthough it is locked, he easily gets out the pieceby means of a secret opening, availing himself ofthat minute to put in a false piece, and to leavethe box with the same person, whom he causesto believe that the piece is or is not within, ac¬cording to the manner the box is shaken; atlength, the original piece is found in the shoe ofone of the company, either by means of the per¬son being in confederacy, and having a similarpiece, or by sending another to slip in on thefloor, in this last case, it is found on the floor,and the person fixed on is persuaded that it fellfrom his shoe as he was taking it off.Handkerchief Hearth.Cover the metal case of a watch with part ofa handkerchief, single only; brings the ends tothat side where the glass is, and hold the hand¬kerchief by them there, so as to stretch it tight-ly over the metal. You may then place a redhot coal, or a piece of lighted paper, upon thatpart of the handkerchief which is so strained overthe metal without burning it; the caloric merelypassing through the handkerchief to fix in themetal.Knotted thread.Considerable amusement, not unmixed withwonder, may be occasioned among a party ofladies, by a clever performance of this trick. Itis most frequently performed by a female, butthe effect of it is considerably increased when itis displayed by a boy. A piece of calico, mus¬lin, or linen, is taken in the left hand, a needle isthreaded in the presence of the spectators, andthe usual, or even a double or treble knot madeat the extremity of one of the ends of it. Theoperator commences his work by drawing theneedle and the thread in it quite through thelinen, notwithstanding the knot, and continuesto make several stiches in like manner succes¬sively.The mode of performing this seeming wonder,is as follows ; a bit of thread, about a quarter ofa yard long, is turned once round the top of themiddle finger of the right hand, upon which athimble is then placed to keep it secure. Thismust be done privately, and the thread kept con¬cealed, while the needle is threaded with a bit17of thread of a similar length. The tnreaa in theneedle must have one of its ends drawn up nearlyclose, and be concealed between the fore fingerand thumb; the other should hang down nearlyas long, and by the side of the thread which isfastened under the thimble, so that these twomay appear to be the two ends of the thread.The end of the piece that is fastened under thethimble is then knotted, and the performer be¬gins to sew, by moving his hand quickly afterhe has taken up the stich. It will appear asthough he actually passed the knotted threadthrough the cloth.How TO BREAK A STAFF UPON TWO GLASSESof Water.Place the Glasses (being full of Water) upontwo joint stools, or such like, equidistant fromthe ground, and distant one from another thelength of the staff; then place the end of the staffupon the edges of the two glasses, so that theybe sharp; this done, with all the force you can,with another staff, strike the staff which lies onthe glasses in the midst, and it will break with¬out breaking the glasses, or spilling the water.To shuffle Cards in such a Manner as al¬ways to keep one certain Card at theBottom.A person with a hard hand and stiff jointsshould never think of playing deception with the18cards, as clumsy fingers will not do. In show¬ing tricks with cords, the principal point consistsin shuffling them nimbly, and yet keeping onecertain card either at the bottom or in some knownplace of the pack, four or five cards from the bot¬tom ; for by this you may seem to work wonders;since it is easy for you to see, or take notice of acard ; which, though you are perceived to do, itit will not be suspected if you shuffle them welltogether afterwards, by the method here to betaught, which is this; in shuffling, let the bottomcard be always kept a little before, or which isbest, a little behind all the rest of the cards; putit a little beyond the rest before, right over yourfore finger, or else, which is the best, a little be¬hind the rest, so as the little finger of the lefthand may slip up, and meet with it at first:shuffle as thick as you can, and at last throw up¬on the board the bottom card, with as many moreas you would preserve for any purpose, a littlebefore or a little behind the rest; and be sure tolet your fore finger, (if the pack be laid before)or your little finger, (if the pack be laid behind)always creep up to meet with the bottom card,and when you feel it, you may there hold it, tillyou have shuffled over again, which being done,the card which was first at the bottom : will comethere airain; thus you may shuffle them beforetheir faces, and yet leave your noted card at the19bottom; you must try to be perfect in this modeof shuffling, and having once obtained it, youmay do almost what you please; for whateverpack you make, though it is ten, twelve, or twen¬ty cards, you may still keep it next the bottom,and shuffle them often to please the curious.To CALL FOR ANY CARD IN THE PaCK.This trick, which requires very little practiceto perform, is done in the following manner.Have privately seen a card, put it at the bottomof the pack, then shuffle the cards till it comesto the bottom again, then put the cards behindyou; and say here I call for naming the bottomcard which you have seen, and as you hold thembehind you, turn the top card with the face up¬wards, then hold forth the cards, and as you holdthem you may see what the next card is ; thenput the cards behind you again, and take the topcard, and put at the bottom, with its face down¬wards, and turn the next card with its face up¬wards, and whilst you are doing this, say, hereI call for, naming the card, you saw last; thenhold forth the cards again, showing the bottomcard which will be that you call for; then put thecards behind you again and proceed in the samemanner as you did before; you may by this methodgo through them all, and call for all the cards inthe pack, to the admiration of the beholders, who20will be surprised how you could find them outwhen you hold them behind you.How to lift a Bottle with a Straw.Take a straw, and having bent the thicker endof it in a sharp angle, put this curved end intothe bottle, so that the bent part may rest againstits side; you may then take the other end andlift up the bottle by it, without breaking thestraw, and this will be the more readily accom¬plished as the angular part of the straw approach¬es nearer to that which comes out of the bottle.It is necessary, in order to succeed in this feat,to be particularly careful in choosing a stoutstraw, which is neither broken nor bruised; .f ithave been previously bent or damaged, it is un¬fit for the purpose of performing this trick, as itwill be too weak in the part so bent, or damaged,to support the bottle.The Golden Head, which, leaping anddancing in a Glass, answers differentQuestions.To show that this head is not connectea withany other object, you put some crown pieces atthe bottom of a glass, and a covering over all,this however does not prevent the head, whichyou affirm to be of solid gold, from dancing inthe glass to answer by numbers, and yes or no,to questions proposed to it; at the same time, abunch of rings, to another glass, at a little dis-tar.ce, as if by sympathy, performs the same mo¬tions. In the room of the first head, which isshown round to the company, you take a secondfrom the table, where the experiment is to be per¬formed. This second head is attached to a silkenthread which passes through the partition intothe hands of the confederate ; this thread, insteadof leaning on the brim of the glass, where the cov¬er would prevent it from sliding, passes througha small well-polished nick to give it easy playand prevent it from breaking N. B. The crownpieces, which you put in the bottom of the glass,under pretext of preventing any communicationbetween the golden head, and the machinery,which may be suspected to be hid in the table,are not useless, for they serve as ballast, and pre¬vent the glass from yielding to the motion occa¬sioned by drawing the threadThe Wonderful Dye.Dissolve indigo in diluted sulphuric acid, andadd to it an equal quantity of solution of carbon¬ate of potass. If a piece of white cloth be dip¬ped in this mixture it will be changed to blue;yellow' cloth, in the same mixture, may be chang¬ed to green ; red to purple; and blue litmus pa¬per to be turned to redTo find the Points cast on iwo Dice.For this trick, east both the dice, and thenmark how many points appear at the top; then22let him take up one of them (no matter which),and see what number is at the bottom, and addall together; then let him cast the dice again,and add the points cast to the former sum; letthe dice stand, bring seven with you, and thenadd the points which appear at the top of thedice, and you will find so many were cast in thewhole.How TO KNIT A KNOT UPON A HANDKERCHIEF,AND TO UNDO THE SAME WITH WORDS.Make one plain loose knot with the two cor¬ner ends of a handkerchief, and seeming to drawthe same very hard, hold fast the body of thesaid handkerchief near to the knot with your righthand, pulling the contrary end with your lefthand, which is the corner of that tvhich you hold ;then close up handsomely the knot, which willbe somewhat loose, and pull the handkerchief sowith your right hand as the left hand end maybe near to the knot, then will it seem to be a trueand firm knot; and to make it appear more as¬suredly to be so, let a stranger pull at the endwhich you have in your left hand, while youhold fast the other in your right hand, and thenholding the knot with your fore-finger and thumb,and the lower part of your handkerchief with yourother finger as you hold a bridle, when you wouldwith one hand slip up the knot and lengthen thereins; this done, turn your handkerchief over the23knot with the left hand, in doing whereof youmust suddenly slip out the end or corner, puttingup the knot of your handkerchief with your fore¬finger and thumb, as you would put up the afore¬said knot of your bridle; then deliver the samecovered and wrapt within the midst of the hand¬kerchief to one to hold fast, and after pronounc¬ing some words of art, take the handkerchief andshake it, and it will be loose.How TO COMMAND SEVEN HaDFPENCE THROUGHa Table.This feat is one of the greatest that the jug¬glers have done, and is inferior to none. To dothis, you must go to some tinman, or any bodythat knows how to make your holes room enoughfor a die to go in and out, and then let them clapa good halfpenny upon them all, and so makethem fast, and nobody can tell them from trueones ; then you must get a cap to cover yourhalf-pence, a cap and a die for the company tosling to amuse them; when you are thus providedwith half-pence, a cap, and a die, the manner oiperformance is thus; desire any body in the com¬pany to lend seven half-pence, telling them thatyou will soon return them their own again ; thensay, ‘ Gentlemen,’ this is made just fit for yourmoney ; then clapping your cap on, desire some¬body in the company, to fling that die to see whatthey can fling, and in so doing take off the cap,21and convey your false money into the cap, scthat the company, may not see you put it in, thenwith your cap over the die, so with your right Fhand take up the true money, and put it into theleft under the table, saying, ‘ Vade, begone, 1command the die to be gone, and the money tocome in the placeso take up the cap, and thedie is gone, and the money is come, coveringthe money again with the cap, so taking the truemoney in your right hand, and knocking underthe table, making a jingling as though the mon¬ey was coming through the table, then flingingthem on the table, say, ‘ There is the money,’and with your right hand take oft’ the cap, say¬ing, ‘ And there is the die so convey the falsemoney into your lap, and there is the cap like-wise.—This is an ingenious feat if well handled,here make the figure of a die, and the fashion ofseven half-pence, and a cap to cover them.FINIS.♦I

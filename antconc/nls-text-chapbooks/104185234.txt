found ;But faith! he could ne’er save a shilling,Though tatoes he sold hy the pound.So says he to my mother one night,To England suppose you and I go ;And the very next day hy moonlightThey took leave of the county Sligo.Sing, fal de ral lal de ral la fal la de, &c.That the land is all covered with water,’Twixt England and Ireland you’ll own,And single misfortunes, they say,To an Irishman, ne’er came alone :So my father, poor man, was first drowned,Then shipwreck’d in sailing from Cork ;But my mother she got safe to land.And a whisky shop opened in York.Sing, fal de ral, Ac,Just a year after father was dead,One night about five in the morn,An odd accident happen'd to me,For ’twas then that myself was first born:4All this I’ve been told by my mammy.And surely she’ll not tell a wrong ;But I don’t remember nought of it,Caze it happen’d when I were quite young.Sing, fal de ral, Ac.On the very same day the next year.For so ran the story of mother,The same accident happened again,But not to me, then, that were brother.So ’twas settled by old Father Luke,Who dissolv’d all our family sins.As we both were born on the same day.That we sartainly must have been twins.Sing, fal de ral, Ac.«’Twas agreed I should not go to school,As learning I never should want;Nor would they e’en teach me to read.For my genius, they said, it would cramp.Now this genius of mine where it lay.Do but listen a while and you’ll hear:—’Twas in drawing—not landscapes and pictures,No! mine were for drawing of beer.Sing, fal de ral, Ac.Some with only one genius are blest, .But I it appears had got two ;For when I had drawn off some beer,I’d a genius for drinking it too.At last I was drawn up to town.Without in my pocket a farden ;But since I’ve earned many a crown,By the shop here in sweet Common garden.Sing, fal de ral, &c.Now the end of my song's drawing near,I'll tell ye, hut that’s nothing new ;Now all my ambition’s to try,And do what I can to draw you ;In which, if I do but succeed.And my efforts beguile you of pain ;I entreat you’ll not wait to be asked,To come often and see me again.THE IRISH SMUGGLER.From Brighton two Paddies walked under the cliff.For pebbles and shells to explore.When too a small barrel was dropt from a skiff,Which floated at length to the shore ;Says Dermont to Pat, we the owner will bilk.To-night we’ll be merry and frisk),l know it as well as my own mother’s milk,Dear joy, ’tis a barrel of whisky.Says Pat, I’ll soon broach it, a fortunate lot,Now Pat, you must know was no joker ;111 go to Tom Murphy, who lives in the cot,And borrow his kitchen hot poker.’’"was said and ’twas done, the barrel was bor’d,No bachanals ever felt prouder,When Paddy found out a small error on board.The whisky, alas ! was gunpowder.With sudden explosion he flew o er the ocean,And high in air sported a leg ;Yet instinct prevails, when philosophy fails.So he kept a tight hold of the keg.But Dermout bawled out with a terrible shout,I’m not to be choused, Mr Wiseman ;If vou do not come down, I'll run into the town,And by St Patrick I’ll tell the Exciseman.THE KING OF THE FAIRIES.A wee, wee man came to our toun en,Fiddledum, faddledum, fee, fee, fee ;An’ he sang sae sweet, that the hale o’ our menLap aff their looms the carle to see.His cap was red, an’ his breeks were green,Fiddledum, faddledum, fee, fee, fee ;An’ his jacket the shortest that ever was seen.An’ the queerest colour you ever did see.His nose was as flat as the back o’ my han’,Fiddledum, faddledum, fee, fee, fee ;An’ his feet wad hae covered an acre o’ lan’.Yet his Boots cam’ up o’er the lid o’ his knee.His e’en were grey without ony white,Fiddledum, faddledum, fee, fee, fee ;An’ his teeth were as black as the middle o’ night.When the moon has forsaken this countrie.7His legs were as bow’d as the half o’ a hoop,JFiddledum, faddledum, fee, fee, fee ;An’ his arms were sae lang, lie ne’er needit to stoop.For he picked up preens without bending his knee,He laughed, and the hale o’ the men o’ our toun,Fiddledum, faddlcdum, fee, fee, feo ;Lap out o’ their wits and fell down in a swoon,The fient o’ them had the power to flee.He sang, and they sprang to their feet in a crack,Fiddledum, faddledum, fee, fee, fee ;Now what I relate is a notable fact,For I was sleeping when I did it see.He play’d them a jig, and the dancing began,Fiddledum, faddledum, fee, fee, fee;And he led them to where a big water down ran,Where he douked them till they were like to die.This queer wee man lap up on a hill,Fiddledum, faddledum, fee, fee, fee;An’ he open’d his mouth like the door o’ a mill,I hope sic a mouth I will ne’er again see.But thunder ne’er gied sic a terrible roar,Fiddledum, faddledum, fee, fee, fee;As when he announced that the dancing was o'er,An’ bade them fareweel, an’ awa’ did flee.Weary and wet our men cam’ hame,Fiddledum, faddledum, fee, fee, fee ;An’ swore the wee man was surely to blame,For using sic freedoms in ony countrie.8Ye’ll wonder what came o’ this wee, wee man,Fiddledum, faddledmn, fee, fee, fee;He bought a green coat—an’ to fairy lan’ ran,An’ now he is king o’ that countrie.GET UP AND BAR THE DOOR.There dwalt a man on Crawford moor.And John Blunt was his name ;lie made gude maut, and brew’d gude ale,And bore a wond’rous fame.Now it fell upon a Martinmas time.And a gay time it was than,That Johnie’s wife had puddings to make,And she boil’d them in the pan.The wind swept cauld frae north to south,And blew into the floor ;Quoth our gudeman to our gudewife,Get up and bar the door.My hand is in my husewife-cap,Gudeman as ye may see ;If its no barr’d this hunder year,It’s no be barr’d by me.They made a paction ’tween them twa,A paction firm and sure,"Whoever spoke the foremost word.Should rise and bar the door.Twa travellers had tint their gate,As o’er the hills they foor,And airted by the line o’ light.Made straight to Johnnie’s door.Now whether is this a rich man’s house.Or whether is it a poor ?But ne’er a word wad aue o' them speak.For the barring of the door.And first they ate the white puddings,And syne they ate the black:O muckle thought our gudewife to hersel.But ne’er a word she spake.The young ane to the auld ane said.Here, man, take ye my knife,And gang and shave the gudeman’s beard.While I kiss the gudewife.But there’s nae water in the house,And what shall I do than ?—What ails ye at the pudding broo.That’s simmering in the pan?0, up then started our gudeman,An angry man was he—Will ye kiss my wife afore my face.And scaud me wi’ pudding bree.An’ up an’ started our gudewife,Gae three skips o’er tire fioor,Gudeman, ye’ve spoke the foremost word.Get up and bar the door«10LOGAN WATER.O Logan, sweetly didst thou glide,That day I was my Willie’s bride:And years sinsyne hae o’er us run,Like Logan to the summer sun.But now thy flow’ry banks appearLike drumlie winter, dark and drear,While my dear lad maun face his faes,Far far frae me and Logan braes.Again the merry month of May,Has made our hills and valleys gay,The birds rejoice in leafy bowers,The bees hum round the breathing flowersBlythe morning lifts his rosy eye,And evening tears are tears of joy ;My soul, delightless, a’ surveys,While Willie’s far frae Logan braes.Within yon milk-white hawthorn bush,Amang her nestlings sits the thrush.Her faithfu’ mate will share her toil.Or wi’ his song her cares beguile ;But I wi’ my sweet nurslings here,Nae mate to help, nae mate to cheer,Pass widow’d nights and joyless days.While Willie’s far frae Logan braes.O, wae upon you men o’ state,That brethren rouse to deadly hate!As ye make mony a fond heart mourn,Sac mav it on your heads return.11How can your flinty hearts enjoy.The widow’s tear, the orphan’s cry ? .But soon may peace bring happy days.And Willie hame to Logan braes !BANKS OF ALLAN WATER.On the banks of Allan water,When the sweet spring time did fall.Was the miller’s lovely daughter.Fairest of them all.For his bride a soldier sought her,And a winning tongue had he ;On the banks of Allan water,None so gay as she.On the banks of Allan water.When brown autumn spreads his store,There I saw the miller’s daughter ;But she smiled no more.For the summer grief had brought her,And her soldier false was he ;On the banks of Allan water,None so sad as she.On the banks of Allan water.When the winter snow fell fast.Still was seen the miller’s daughter,Chilling blew the blast.But the miller’s lovely daughter,Both from cold and care was free—On the banks of Allan water.There a corse lay she.THE CARLE HE CAM’ OWER THE CRAFT.The carle he cam’ ower the craft,Wi' liis beard new-shaven ;lie looked at me as he’d been daft—The carle trowed that I wad hae him !Hout awa ! I winna hae him !Na, forsooth, I winna hae him !For a’ his beard’s new-shaven,Ne’er a bit o’ me will hae him,A siller brooch he gae me neist,To fasten on my curchie nookit;I wore’t a wee upon my breist,But soon, alake ! the tongue o’t crookit;And sae may his ; I winna hae himNa, forsooth, I winna hae him!Twiee-a-bairn’s a lassie’s jest;Sae ony fool for me may hae him.The carle has nae fault but ane ;For he has land and dollars plenty ;But waes me for him, skin and baneIs no for a plump lass of twenty.Ilout awa, I winna hae him !Na, forsooth, I winna hae him !"What signifies his dirty riggs.And cash, without a man wi’ them ?« * -But should my cankert daddie garMe tak him ’gainst my inclination,I warn the fumbler to bewareThat antlers dinna claim their station.IP,Hout awa! I winna hae him !Na, forsooth, I winna hae him !I’m fleyed to crack the holy hand,Sae lawty says, I shouldna hae him.GUDE ALE COMES.0 gude ale comes, and gude ale goes ;Gude ale gars me sell my hose,Sell my hose, and pawn my shoon ;Gude ale keeps my heart aboon.o1 had sax oxen in a pleuch,And they drew tench and weel eneuch ;I drank them a’ just ane by ane ;Gude ale keeps my heart aboon.I had forty shillings in a clout,Gude ale gart me p v ke them out;That gear should mouT I thought a sinGude ale keeps my heart aboon.Gude ale bauds me bare and busy.Gars me moop wi’ the servant hizzie.Stand i’ the stool, when I hae done ;Gude ale keeps my heart aboon.0 gude ale comes, and gude ale goes :Gude ale gars me sell my hose,Sell my hose, and pawn my shoou ;Gude ale keeps my heart aboon.14THEY’RE A’ TEASING ME.O wha is he I loe sae weel ?Wha was my heart an’ a’,O wha is he ? ’tis sair to tellHe’s o’er the seas awa’,There’s Charlie he’s a sodger lad,And Davie blythe is he.And Willie in his tartan plaid,They’re a’ teasing me.O they’re a’ tease teasing.They’re a’ teasing me.They’re a’ tease teasing,O they’re a teasing me.There’s Carl the chief o’ Daftne glen.And he has land and store,With flow’ry mead, and shady fen.And siller o’er and o’er.“ Quoth he, sweet lass, I’ll marry thee("Yestreen in yonder shaw,)And thou my aiu true bride shall be,And Queen o’ Daftne ha!”O they’re a’ tease, &c.But when my Jamie comes again.Young Carl will then descry,That siller is but empty gain.To hearts nae gowd can buy.My Jamie’s brave, my Jamie’s braw,My Jamie’s a’ to me,And tho’ his siller store be sma’Yet his I’ll only be.For they’re a’ tease, &c.15TO MARY IN HEAVEN.Thou ling’ring star, with lessViing ray,Tim lov’st to greet the early morn.Again thou usher’st in the dayMy Mary from my soul was torn.O mary, dear departed shade!Where is thy place of blissful rest ?Seest thou thy lover lowly laid ?Hear’st thou the groans that rend his breast ?That sacred hour can I forget!Can I forget the hallowed grove,Where by the winding Ayr we met,To live one day of parting love !Eternity will not effaceThose records dear of transports past,—Thy image at our last embrace ;—Ah! little thought we ’twas our last!Ayr, gurgling, kiss’d his pebbled shore,O'erhung with wild woods, thick’ning, greenThe fragrant birch, and hawthorn hoar,Twin’d am’rous round the raptur’d scene.The flowers sprang wanton to be prest,The birds sing love on every spray,Till too, too soon, the glowing westProclaim’d the speed of winged day.Still o’er these scenes my mem’ry wakes.And fondly broods with miser care :Time but the impression stronger makes.As streams their channels deeper wear.My Mary, dear departed shade !Where is thy place of blissful rest ?Seest thou thy lover lowly laid ?Hear’st thou the groans that rend his breast ?THE HIGHLAND LADDIE.The Lawland lads think they are fine,But 0! they’re vain and idle gaudy ;How much unlike the gracefu’ mien,And manly looks of my Highland laddie.O my bonnie Highland laddie,My handsome, charming Highland laddie ;May heaven still guard, and love reward.The lawland lass and her Highland laddie.If I were free at will to choose,To be the wealthiest Lawland lady,I’d tak young Donald without trews,With bonnet blue, and belted plaidie.O my bonnie, Ac.iThe bra west beau in burrows town.In a’ his airs, wi’ art made ready,Compar’d to him, he’s but a clown.He’s finer far in’s tartan plaidie.O my bonnie, Ac.O’er benty hill wi’ him I’ll run,And leave my Lawland kin and daddie ;17Frae ■winter’s eanlJ and summer’s sun.He’ll screen me wi’ his tartan plaidie.0 my bonnie, &c.A painted room, and silken bed.May please a Lawland laird and lady ;But I can kiss, and be as glad,Behind a bush in’s tartan plaidie.0 my bonnie, &c.Few compliments between us pass ;I ca’ him my dear Highland laddie,And he ca’s me his Lawland lass,Syne rows me in beneath his plaidie.0 my bonnie, &c.Nae greater joy I’ll e’er pretend,Than that his love prove true and steady.Like mine to him, which ne’er shall end,While Heav’n preserves my Highland laddie.O my bonnie, &c.THE CONFESSION.With sorrow and repentance true,Father, I trembling come to you ;I know I’ve too indulgent beenTo one, but oh! forgive the sin.To one whom still I love, tho’ hoUngrateful proves, and false to me ;Then let me on my knees confessHow I've been tempted to transgress.18Oh! rev’rend father, if you knewThe charms of him, alas! untrue ;0 had you heard the false one swear1 was the fairest of the fair ;You could not, holy Sir, refuseSo slight a weakness to excuse ;He swore my eyes were loveliness.Ah! let me then my fault confess.To grief, eternal grief a prey.His name is all my heart can say ;When bath’d in sad repentant tears.Still to my mind his name appears ;Yes, ’tis that name, that name alone,Which bends me now before thy throne ;Alcander—but I can’t express.Oh !

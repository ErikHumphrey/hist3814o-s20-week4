But’ after;S had flourifhed twenty-nine years, muchnlarging its borders, he left it to his Ion11ms, lor which reafon it is, by Homer andmier poets, often called Illium; but it hadhe name of Troy from Trofs, the fucceed-ing4 ‘The famous Hijtory ofing king, who, after he had conquered th<Thrigians, his neighbours, in a might)battle, and annexed their country to it;named it Troy, and commanded his fub-jefts to call themfelves Trojans.This king reigned fuccersfully manjyears, and dying left the kingdom andgreat riches to Leomedon, his bon, whcenlarged the wails of Troy, built ftrongtowers, and had many fair children; fcthat he was a liranger to adverfity, till afodd adventure happened, viz. A mortalplague having wafted his country, and thoulands of his fubje&s daily dying of it, h«Tent to enquire of the Oracle, to know tfacaufe of it, and how it might be removedHaving anfwer returned, that Apollo ancNeptune, the gods of the fun and fea, wenangry with him for his breach of promilein negle&ing to build them a new templewith the money they had taken out of thsold one, feeing they had fo much contributeed to the advantage of his country, and th<building of the walls of his city ; and tha:the. plague fhould not be flayed till it hatwafted his whole people, unlefs a virgin above fixteen years, was daily offered up t<,a fea mcnfter which Neptune would lend t(devour her, if no valiant knight in finghcombat could kill the monfter.This, to fave' the general deftru&icnwas agreed on j till at iaft ail the virginbu;the Deflruction of Troy. 5but Exione, the king’s daughter, was de¬voured, for whci'e hard fortune the peoplpgreatly lamented, as being a virtuous lady,-of a beauteous behaviour, and exceeding: fair: When at that inftant (he was led to-ibe bound to the rock, followed by herweeping fillers, who were married, and amultitude of people, the mighty Hercules,;whofe name made nations tremble, return¬ing from winning the golden fleece, arrived;in the port, and enquiring into the matter,1 offered himfelf to be the lady’s champion.King Leomedon, upon this greatly, rejoic-ied, and promifed him, if he overcame theunonfler, to give him whatever he defirediin his kingdom; telling him a lamentable.iftory of their defires and fufferings, wrhichmoved him to pity. But whilfl they weredifcourfing, the fea came rowling on inmighty weaves from afar; and immediatelythey could perceive the monfler, in a terri¬ble form and bignefs, making to the (bore;iwhereupon the virgin being bound to the■rock, to wait the event, having only &cambrick fliift over her delicate body. Her-cules took a huge iron club, which two;(lrong men at his requeft, had fetched fromTroy on -their fhoulders, and entering aboat began a combat with the monfter, whoroared terribly, and fpouted floods of water1on him, endeavouring to catch him in hismoniirous mouth, and fv,allow him whole ;but6 The famous Hi/tory cfbut with mighty ftro.kes of his club he re¬pelled him, and at laA battered his ftuilquite into his brains, when with a terribleroaring he died : Whereupon the fea with¬drew and left him upon the fands, and fo:hideous was his form, that the Trojans-trembled to behold him tho’ dead. Here¬upon Hercules releafed the lady with greatjoy, leadin^ her to the city, where he wasreceived in triumph with feveral nobleGreeks his accomplices, and feafled many,days. Then he demanded as his reward,:king Leomedon’s two milk-white horfesthat drew his chariot; but the perfidious Iking, finding the plague ceafed, and hisdaughter preferved, grew unmindful of hispromife, and the mighty obligation laid ’upon him, yet difl-embled the matter; tillHercules one day going a hunting, at his .return found the city gates shut againft him,';and upon demanding entrance, Leomedon 'from the wall denied k, faying. He went ■about to move his fubjefls to rebel againit .him,, and charging him and his Greeks im-:mediately to depart the land.Then Hercules defired the horfes accord- :ing to his oath and rromife, as the reward; ‘but he with tlireats refufed to deliver them.Whereupon ihe mighty warrior thus vented ;his anger: “ Falfe and ungrateful king, ■■“ doft thou deny me the reward of my la-“ hour, requiting me e\il for good ? bythe Destruction of Troy. 7‘ the gods I fwear, as I with this club have‘ delivered Troy from many evils, withthe fame I will bring far worfe upon it,:t fo that the living Trojans fnall fay, thole4 that died of the plague are the happier.’*And thereupon turning his back on theiproud walls of Troy, he went, burningj with anger, to his (hip, in the company ofPrince Thefeus Philots, a mighty giantwhom he had conquered in the Hefperantflfles, and taken from him fheep valued atijtheir weight in gold, and thence calledgolden fleeces, and arriving in Greece, w ashighly welcomed by King Creon, Eurifte-ous, and Amphitrion his fuppofed father,and ether kings and princes ; to whom, af¬ter great feafting, having made his com¬plaint of the wrong done him by Leome-don, they ail vowed to aiiifl: him in reveng¬ing it, and thereupon railed 2o,oco valiantjmen which foon embarked and by the waythey facked and burnt Parifla and Tenedos,wealthy cities belonging to the Trojans,and in a defperate battle overthrew Leome-don, and took his fon Priamus prifoner ;on which Leomedon was obliged to retreat,and Hercules purfued lo violently, beatingdown all before him, that he feized thegates of the city and let in the Greeks erehalf the Trojans were entered, fo that mif-erable cru s and flaughter enfued; whereu¬pon Leomedon feeing all loft, fled with hx-.

Hutchison, Bookseller,19. SaltmarJcet.1823.QUEEN MARY’S LAMENTATION.I sing and lament me in vain,these walls can but echo ray moan,Alas; it increases'my pain,when I think on the days that are goneThrough the gate of my prison I see,the birds as they wanton in air,My heart how it pants to be free,my looks they are wild with dispair.Above, though opprest by my fate,I burn with contempt for my foes.Though fortune has alter’d my state,she ne’er can subdue me to those.False woman, in ages to come,thy malice detested shall be,And when we are cold is the tomb,some heart will still sorrow for me.Ye roofs where cold damps and dismay,with silence and solitude dwell.How comfortless passes the day ?how sadly tolls the evening bell:3The owls from the battlement cry,hollow winds seem to murmur around,O Mary! prepare thee to die,my blood it runs cold at the sound.The ORANGE And BLUE.IT was on a^Monday morning,as I was going to M;ws,I had no mind of listing,until they did mo press:Bad company enticed me topartake of a full flowing bowl,And the advance money they gave me,was a guinea and a crown.O! my dearest dear he is listed,and ta’en a white cockade,O! he is a clever fellow,besides he’s a roving blade.Sure he is a clever fellow,and is gone tosei ve the King;My very heart is a bleedingall for the love ©f him#It was on a monday morning,just by the break cf day, \The Captain commanded the Leutenant,to march those men away.■ 4He mai-ch’d them all in rank and file,all on the Irish shore,Fare you well sweet Molly dear,if 1 never see you more.He pull’d out his pocket-kerchief,and wip’d her christal eyes,He says, My dearest jewel,I’m sorry for your sighs.But if ever I come back again,and all goodness spares my life.There is not a woman breathing,but you I’ll make my wife.My dear, I will convoy you,as far as sweet Straban,My dearest. I’ll convoy youas far as e’er I can,My hand I never will giveto any man but you,And now you’re going to leave mefor the Orange and the Blue.He’s gone, he’s gone, and left me,behind him for to rove,His name I’ll carve on every tree,through Belanamurry grove,Please God that he return againand his consort make me,I’ll prove a faithful loving wife,until the day I die.oQLORD GREGORY.O Mirk, mirk is this midnight hour,And loud’s the tempes’t roar;A waefu’ wanderer seeks thy tow’r,Lord Gregor, ope thy door.An exile frae her father’s ha’,And a’ for loving thee;At least some pity on me shaw,If love it may na be.Lord Gregory, mird’st thou not the groveBy bonnie Irwine-side,Where first I own’d that virgin-loveI lang, lang had denied.How aften didst thou pledge and vow,Thou wad for ay be mine;And thy fond heart, itsel’ sae true,It ne’er mistrusted thineHard is thy heart, Lord Gregory,And flinty is thy breast:Thou dart ofheav’n that flashcstby,O wilt thou give me rest!Ye mustering thunders, from above,Your willing victim see 1But spare and pardon my fause love,His wrangs to heaven and me !6TAK 'YOUR AULD CLOKE ABOUT YEIn winter when the rain rain’d ca-uld,And frost and snaw cn ilka hill,And Borens, wi’ his blasts sae bauld,Was tbrcat’ning a’our Icye to ktil:Then Bel!, my wife, wha lo’es nae strife,She said to me right hastily,Gjet up gudeman, save Cromie’s lifeAnd tak’ your auld cloke about ye.O Bell why dost thou flyte and scorn?Thou kens my cloke is very |htn:It is sae bare and overworn,A cricket thereon canna rin ;Then I’ll nae mair barrow nor lend,For I’ll ance mair'apparell’d be,To-morrow I’ll to the town and spendAnd I’ll hae. a new cloke about me.My Cromie is an useful cow,And she is come of a good kin’,Aft has she wat the bairns’ m >u’,And I am lailh that she should tine;Get up, gudeman; it is fou time,The sun shines in the lift sne hie;Sloth never made a gracious end,Gac tak’ your auld cloke about ye.My cloke was once a gude grey cloke,When it was fitting for my wear;701But now its scantily worth a groat,For I ha’e won’t this thretty year:Let’s spend the gear that,we hae won,We litt'e ken the day we’ll die:Then I’ll be proud, since I hae swornTo hae a new doke about me.In days when our King Robert rang,His trows they coast but ha’f a crown.He said thy were a groat o’er dear,And ca’d the tailor thief and loan ;He was a king that wore a crown,And thou’rta man oflaigh degree;’Tis pride brings a’ the kintra down,Sae tak’ thy auld doke about thee.Every land has its ain laugh,Ilk kind o’ corn has its ain hool;I think the watld is a’ run rang,When ilka wife her man wad rule;Do ye not see Rob, Jock, and Hab »How they are girded gallantly,While I sit hurklin in the ase ?I’ll hae a new cloke about roe.• iwtfsiu v;i» ' cj ; "Guderaan, I wat ’tis thretty years,Since we did ane anither ken;And we hae had between us twa,0 lads and bonny lassies ten:Now, they are women grown and men,1 wish and pray weel may they be;And if you prove a good husband,E’en tak’ your auld cloke about ye.Bell, ray wife, she lo'*» nae strifeBut she will guide me if she can ;And, to maintain an easy life,I aft maun yield, though I’m gudeman.Nought’s to be won at woman’s hand,Unless ye gi’e her a’ the plea;Then I’ll leave aff where I began,And tak’ my auld cloke about me.THE SAILOR’S RETURN.BEHOLD from many a hostile shore.And all the dangers of the main,Where billows mount, aud tempests roar,Your faithful Tom returns again;Returns, and with him brings a heartThat ne’er from Sally shall depart.After long toils and troubles past,How sweet to trade our native soil,With conquest to return at last?And deck our sweethearts with the spoil!No one to beauty should pretend,But such as dare its right defend.FINIS.

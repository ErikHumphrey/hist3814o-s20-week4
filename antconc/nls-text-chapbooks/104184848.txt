ALI BABA,OR, THEForty ThievesAn Interesting Tale.FALKIRK:HWINTRD AND SOLD BT T. JOHWaTOM.1827.S0 9ALT BABA,OR, THEFORTY THIEVES.In the town of Persia there lived twobrothers, the sons of a poor man ; the-onewas named Cassim, and the other Ali Baba.Cassim, the elder, ‘married a wife with ac msiderable fortune, and lived at his ease,ma handsome house, with plenty of ser-vmts ; but the wife of Ali Baba was asp >or as himself; they dwelt in a mean cot¬tage in the suburbs of the city, and hemaintained his family by cutting wo ad ina neighbouring forest.One day when Ali Baba was in the for¬est and preparing to load his asses with thewood he had cut, lie saw a troop of horse¬men approaching toward him. He had of-,ten heard of robbers who infested that for¬est, and, in great fright, he hasti’y climbed4a lanje thick tree, which stood near thefoot of a rock, and hid himself among thebranches.The horsemen soon galloped up to therock, where they all dismounted. Ali Babacounted forty of them, and he could notdoubt but they were thieves, by their ill-looking countenances. They each took aloaded portmanteau from his horse, and hewho seemed to be their captain, turningto the rock, said. Open Sesame, and im¬mediately a door opened in the rock, andall the robbers passed in, when the doorshut of itself. In a short time the dooropened again, and the forty robbers cameout, followed by their captain : who said,Shut Sesame. The door instantly closed,and the troop, mounting their horses, werepresently out of sight.Ali Baba remained in the tree a longtime, and seeing that the robbers did notreturn, he ventured down ; and approach¬ing close to the rock, said, Open Sesame,Immediately the door flew open, and AliBaba beheld a specious cavern, very light,and filled with all sorts of provisions, mer¬chandise, rich stuffs, and heaps of gold andsilver coin, which these robbers had takpn5from merchants and travellers. Ali Bab*then went in search of his asses, and havingbrought them to the rock, took as manybags of gold coin as they could carry, andput them on their backs, covering themwith some loose faggots of wood; and after¬wards (not forgetting to say Shut Sesame)he drove his asses back to the city; andhaving unloaded them in the stable belong¬ing to his cottage, carried the bags into thehouse, and spread the gold coin out uponthe floor before his wife.His wife, delighted with possessing somuch money, wanted to count it; but Anding it would take up too much time, shawas resolved to measure it; and rurningto the house of Ali Baba’s brother, she en¬treated them to lend tier a small measure.Cassim’s wife was very proud and ehvi-ous : “ I wonder,” said she to herself,“ what sort of grain such poor people canj have to measure; but I am determined I! will find out what they are doing.” So be¬fore she gave the measure, she artfully rub¬bed the bottom with some suet.Away ran Ali Baba’s wife, measured her| money; and having helped her husband tobury it in the yard, she carried back the6measure to her brother-in-law’s house with¬out perceiving that a piece ot gold was leftsticking to the bottom of it.“ Fine doings, indeed !” cried Cassitn‘swife to her husband, after examining themeasure, “ your brother there, who pre¬tends to be so very poor, is richer than youare, tor he does not count his money, butmeasures it.’ Cassim herring these words, and seeingthe piece of gold, grew as envious as hiswife, and hastened to his brother, threaten¬ed to inform the Cadi of ids wealth, if heid not confess to him how he came by it.. i Baba, without hesitation, told him thehv torv of the robbers, and the secret of theea vand offered him half his treasure ; butthe envious Cassim disdained so poor a sum,rest.: /ed to have fifty times more than thatout < the robber’s cave.Ac rrdingly he rose early the next mor¬ning, id set out with ten mules loadedwith gt it chests. lie found the rock eas¬ily enou.< i by Ali Baba’s description ; andhaving si 1, Open Sesame, he gained ad¬mission in > the cave ; where he foundmore treasi ^ than he even had expectedto behold ft n his brother’s account of it./7He immediately be^an to gather bags otgold, and pieces of rich brocades, all whichhe piled close to the door; but when hehad got together as much, or even morethan his ten mules could possibly carry,and wanted to get out to load them, thethoughts of his wonderful riches had madehim entirely forget the word which causedthe door to open. In vain he tried Bame,Fame, Lame, Tatame, and a thousand[others; the door remained as immovablei as the rock itself, notwithstanding Cassinikicked and screamed, till he was ready todrop with fatigue and vexation. Present-1 ly he heard the sound of horses’ feet, which! he rightly concluded to he the robbers, andhe trembled lest he should now fall a vic¬tim to his thirst of riches.He resolved however to make one effortto escape ; and when he heard Sesame pro¬nounced, and saw the door open, he sprungout; but was instantly put to death by theswords of the robber.The thieves now held a councel, but notone of them could possibly guess by whatmeans Cassim had got into the cave. Theysaw the heaps of treasure he had piled,ready to take away, but they did not mis»8what Ali Baba had secured before. Atlength they agreed to cut Cassim’s bodyinto four quarters, and hang the pieceswithin the cave, that it might terrify anyone from further attempts; and also deter¬mined not to return themselves for sometime to the cave, for fear of being watchedand discovered.When Cassim’s wife saw night come on,and her husband not returned,-she becamegreatly terrified. She watched at her win¬dow till day-break, and then went to tellAli Baba of her fears. Cassim had not in¬formed him of his design of going to thecave, but Ali Baba, new hearing of hisjourney thither, did not wait to be desiredto go in search of him.He drove his asses to the forest withoutdelay. He was alarmed to see blood nearthe rock ; and on entering the cave, hefound the body of his unfortunate brother,cut to pieces, and hung up within the door.It was now too late to save him ; but hetook dow n the quarters, and put them uponorie of his asses, covering them with fag¬gots of wood ; and weeping for the miser¬able end of his brother, he regained theeity.9The door of his brother's house was open¬ed by Morgiana, an intelligent faithful fe¬male slave, who Ali Baba knew was wor¬thy to be trusted with the secret. Hetherefore delivered the body to Morgiana,and went himself to impart the sad tidings; to the wife of Cassim. The poor womanwas deeply afflicted, and reproached her¬self with her foolish envy and curiosity, asbeing the cause of her husband’s death $;i but Ali Baba having convinced her of thei necessity of being very discreet, she check-’ her lamentations, and resolved to leave <^,try thing to the management of Mor¬giana.Morgiana having washed the body, has-I tened to an apothecary’s, and asked fori some particular medicine ; saying it was forI her master Cassini, who was dangerously!i ill. She took care to spread the report ofiCassim’s illness through the neighbour¬hood j and as they saw Ali Baba and iiiswife going daily to the house of their bro¬ther in great affliction, they were not sur¬prised to hear shortly, that Cassim had diedof his disorder.The next difficulty was to bury him with-10out discovery ; but Morgiana was ready tocontrive a plan for that also. She put onher vail, and went to a distant part of thecity very early in the morning, where shefound a poor cobbler, just opening his stall.She put a piece of gold into his hand ; andtold him he should have another, if hewould suffer himself to be blindfolded, andgo with her, carrying his tools with him.Mustapha 1 he cobbler hesitated at first; butthe gold tempted him, and he consented :when Morgiana, carefully covering hiseyes, so that he could not see a step of theway, led him to Cassim’s house ; and takinghim to the room where the body was lying,removed the bandage from his eyes, andbade him sew the mangled limbs together.Mustapha obeyed her orders; and havingrevived two pieces of gold, was led blind¬folded the same way back to his stall.Morgiana, then covering the body witha winding sheet, sent for the undertaker tomake preparations for the funeral; andCassini was buried with all due solemitythat very day.Ali Baba now removed his few goodsand all his gold coin that he had broughtfrom the cavern, to the house of his qe-11ceased brother, of which he took posses¬sion ; ;. id Cassim’s widow received everykind af ention both from Ali Baba and hiswife. 3Afto an interval of some months, thetroop (4 robbers again visited their retreatin the 1*west, and were completely astonish-1 ed to t. nd the body taken away from thei cave, j|id every thing else remaining in itsmi usual §rder. “ We are discovered,** faidI the caj jiain, “ and shall certainly be undonef if we £*o not adopt speedy measures toprevent our ruin. Which of you, my bravei comracg's, will undertake to search out thevillain ho is in possession of our secret?”One tf the boldest of the troop advan¬ced, ano offered himself, and was acceptedon the f flowing conditions; namely, thatif he suci neded in his enterprise, he was ipI be made s \cond in command of the troop;but that it he brought false intelligence, hswas immed '.tely to be put to death.The bold robber readily agreed to theconditions ; id having disguised him sell,he proceeded to the city. He arrivedthere about da -break, and found the cob¬bler Mustapha i his stall, which was alwaysopen before an; shop in the town..12<* Good raorrow, friend,said .the rolvher, as he passed the stall, “ you rise be¬times : I should think, old as you are, youcould scarcely see to work by this light.0** Indeed, Sir,” replied the cobler, “ oldas I am 1 do not want for good eye-sight'as you must needs believe, when I tell you} sewed a dead body together the otherday, where I had not so good a light as Ihave now.”“ A dead body !” exclaimed the robber;he bad luckily met with the very man whocould give him the information he was insearch of. However he did not wish tomake me believe that the people of yourcity do impossible things.”“ I tell you,” said Mustapha in a loudand angry tone, “ I sewed a dead body to¬gether with my own hands.”Then I suppose you can tell me alsowhere you performed this wonderful busi¬ness ?”Upon this, Mustapha related every par¬ticular of his being led blitidfold to thehouse, &c.** Well, my friend,” said the robber,•« 'tis a fine story, I confess, but not veryeasy to believe : however, if you will con-13' Vince me by shewing me the house you! talk, of, I will give you four pieces of goldjj to make amends for my unbelief.’*“ I think,” said the cobler, after consi*> dering awhile, “ that if you were to blind¬fold me, 1 shoidd remember every turning1 we made ; but with my eyes open I am sure! 1 should never find it.”Accordingly the robber covered Musta-pha’s eyes with his handkerchief, who ledhim through most of the principal streets,and stopping by Cassim's door, said, “ hereit is, I went no further than this house.”The robber immediately marked the doori with a piece of chalk; and giving Musta-Spha his four pieces of gold, dismissed him.Shortly after the thief and Mustapha had; quitted the door, Morgiana coming Jiomefrom market, perceived the little mark ofwhite chalk on the door ; and suspectingI something was wrong, directly marked fourdoors on one side and five on the other of11 her master’s, in exactly the same manner,(without saying a word to any one.The robber meantime rejoined his troop,Iand boasted greatly of his success. Hi#captain and comrades praised his diligence;and being well armed, they proceeded to14the town in different disguises and in sepa~rate parties of three and four together.It was agreed among them, that thejwere to meet in the market place at thedusk pf evesing ; and that the captain andthe robber, who had discovered the house,were to go there first, to find out to whomit belonged. Accordingly, being arrivedin the street, and having a lantern withthem, they began to examine the doors,and found, to their confusion and astonish¬ment, that ten doors were marked exactlyalike. The robber, who was the captain’sguide, could net say one word in explana¬tion of this mystery; and when the dis¬appointed troop got back to the forest, hisenraged companions ordered him to beput to death.Another now offered himself upon the•ame conditions as the former ; and havingbribed Mustapha, and discovered the househe made a mark with dark red chalk uponthe door, in a part that was not in the leastconspicuous : and carefully examined thesurrounding doors, to be certain that no•uch mark w as upon any one of them.But nothing could escape the pryingeyesof Morgiana : scarcely had the robber de-parted when he discovered the red mark:and getting some red chalk, she markedseven doors on each side precisely in thesame place and in the same manner.The robber, valuing himself highly uponthe precautions he had taken triumphantlyconducted his captain to the spot: but greatindeed was his confusion and dismay, whenI he found it impossible to say which, amongI fifteen houses marked exactly alike, wasthe right one. The captain, furious withhisdisappointment, returned again-with thethe troop to the forest; and the secondrobber was also condemned to death.The captain having thus lost 2 of his troop,(judged that their hands were more activethan their heads in such services ; and heresolved to employ no other of them, butI to go himself upon the business.Accordingly he repaired to the city, andaddressed him:.elf to the cobler Mustaphajwho for six pieces of gold readily perform¬ed the same services for him he had donefor the two other strangers, and the captainmuch wiser than his men, did not amuseI! himself with setting a mark upon the door,but attentively considered the house, counited the number of its windows, and passedIGby it very often to be ceftain that he shouldknow it again.He then returned to the forest and or.dered his troop to go into the town, andbuy nineteen mules and thirty-eight largejars, one full of oil, and the rest empty.In two or three days the jars were bought,and all things in readiness, and the captainhaving put a man into each jar properlyarmed, the jars being rubbed on the out¬side with oil, and the covers having holesbored in them for the men to breathethrough, loaded his mules, and in the ha-b\J of an oil-merchant, entered the town inthe dusk of the evening. He proceededto the street where Ala Baba dwelt, andfound him sitting in the porch of his house.“ Sir, said he to Ali Baba, “ I have broughtthis oil a great way to sell, and am toolate for this day's market, as I am quite astranger in this town, will you do me thefavour to let me put my mules into yourcourt-yard, and direct me where I maylodge to night ?”Ali Baba, who was a good-natured man,welcomed the pretended oil-merchant verykindly, and offered him a bed in his ownItouse; aud having ordered the mules to17bft unloaded in the yard, and properly fed,he invited his guest into supper. The cap¬tain, having seen the jars placed ready illthe yard, followed Ali Baba into the house,and after supper, was shown to the cham¬ber where he was to sleep.It happened that Morgiana was obligedto sit up later that night than usual, to getready her master’s bathing linen for thefollowing morning; and while she wasbusy about the fire, her lamp went out, andthere was no more oil in the house.After considering what she could possi¬bly do for alight she recollected the thirty-eight oil jars in the yard, and determinedto take a little oil out of one of them forher lamp- She took her oil-pot in her handand approaching the first jar, the robberwithin said, “ Is it time, captain ?” Anyother slave, perhaps, on hearing a man inan oil-jar, would have screamed out; butthe prudent Morgiana instantly recollectedherself, and replied softly, “ No, not yet ;lie still till I call you.” She passed on toevery jar, receiving the same question, andmaking the same answer, tdl she came tothe last, which was really filled with oil.18Morgiana was now convinced that thiswas a plot of the robbers to murder hermaster Ali llaba ; so she ran back to thekitchen, and brought out a large kettle,which she filled with oil, and set it on agreat wood fire; and as soon as it boiled,she went and poured into the jars sufficientof the boiling oil to kill every man withinthem.Having done this, she put out her fire,and her lamp, and crept softly to her cham¬ber.The captain of the robbers, hearing everything quiet in the house} and perceiving nolight any where, arose and went down intothe yard to assemble his men. Coming tothe firrt jar, he felt the steams of the boiledoil j he ran hastily to the rest, and foundevery one of his troop put to death in thesame manner. Full of rage and despair athaving failed in his design, he forced thelock of a door that led to the garden, andmade his ('scape over the walls.On the following morning, Morgiana re¬lated to her master Ali Baba his wonderfuldeliverance from the pretended oil mer¬chant and his gang of robbers. Ali Baba19it first coukl scarcely credit her tale ; but.vhen he saw the robbers dead in the jars,he could not sufficiently praise her courageand sagacity ; and without letting any onedse into the secret, he and Morgiana, thenext night, buried the thirty-seven thievesi'n a deep trench at the bottom of the gor-ilen. The jars and the mules as he had nouse for them, were sent from to time totiie different markets, and soldWhile Ali Baba took these measures toprevent his and Cassini's adventures in theforest from being known, the captain re¬turned to bis cave, and for some time aban¬doned himself to grief and despair. Atlength however lie determined to adopt anew scheme for the destruction of Ali Ba-: ba.‘ lie removed by degrees all the valu¬able merchandise from the cave to the city,uand took a shop exactly opposite to AliBaba's house.He furnished this shop with every thingthat was rare and costly, and went by thename of the merchant Cogio Hassan. Many1 persons made acquaintance with the stran¬ger, and among others, Ali Baba's son wenievery day to his shop. The pretendedCogia Hassan soon appeared to be verygofond of AH Baba's son, offered him manypresents, and often detained him to dinner,on which occasions he treated him in thehandsomest manner.Ali Baba’s son thought it was necessaryto make some return to these civilities, andpressed his father to invite Cogia Hassen tosupper. Aii Baba made no objection, andthe invitation was accordingly given.The artful Cogia Hassan would not toohastily accept this invitation, but pretendedhe was not fond of going into company, andthat he had business which demanded hispresence at home. These excuses only. made Ali Baba's son the more eager to takehim to his father’s house : and after repeat¬ed solicitations, the merchant consented tosup at Ali Baba’s the next evening.A most excellent supper was provided,which Morgiana cooked in the best man¬ner, and, as was her usual custom, she car¬ried in the tirst dish herself. The momentshe looked at Cogia Uassan, she knew himto be the pretended oil-merchant. Theprudent Morgiana did not say a word toany one of this discovery, but sent theother slave into the kitchen, and waited attable herself j and while Cogia Hassan waj21drinking, she perceived he had a daggerlaid under his coat. When supper wasended, and the deseit and wine on the table,Morgiana went away and dressed herself iqthe habit of a dancing girl : she next calledAbdalla, a fellow slave, to play on his taberwhile she-danced.As soon as she appeared at the parlour-door, her master, who was very fond ofseeing her dance, ordered her to come into entertain his guest with some of her bestdancing. Cogia Hassan was not very wellsatisfied with this entertainment, yet wascompelled, lor fear of discovering himself,to seem pleased with the dancing, while ihfact he wished Morgiana a great way off,and was quite alarmed, lest he should losehis opportunity of murdering Ali Baba andhis son.Morgiana danced several dances with theutmost grace and agility; and then drawinga poinard from her girdle, she performedmany surprising things with it, sometime*presenting the point to one and sometimesto another and then seemed to strike it in¬to her own bosom. Suddenly she pausedand holding the poinard in the right hand*presented her left to her- master as if be£-22ging some money; upon which AH Babaand his son each gave her a small piece ofmoney. She then turned to the pretendedCogia Hassan, and while he was putting hishand into his purse, she plunged the poin-a' d into his heart.“Wretch!” cried Ali Baba, “thou bastruined me and my family.”“ No, Sir,” replied Morgiana, “ I havepreserved, and not ruined, you and yourson. Look well at this traitor and you willfind him to be the pretended oil-merchantwho came once before to rob and murderyou.”Ali Baba, having pulled off the turbonand the clock wl'ich the false Cogia Hassanwore, discovered that he was not only thepretended oil-merchant, but the captain ofthe forty robbers, who had slain his brotherCassim ; nor could he doubt that his perfi¬dious aim had been to destroy him, and jprobably his son, with the concealed dag-fer. Ali Baba, who felt tiie new obliga-e owed to Morgiana for thus saving his Ilife a second time, embraced her, and said,“ My dear Morgiana, I give you your li¬berty; but my gratitude must not stop!there ; I will also marry you to my son who23can esteem ami admire you no less thandoes his father.” • Then turning to his sonhe added, “ You, my son, will not refusethe wife I offer ; for, in marrying Mor-, giana, you take to wife the preserver andben efactor of yourself and family.”The son, far from shewing any dislike,readily and joyfully accepted his proposedbride, having long entertained an affectionfor the good slave Morgiana.Having rejoiced in their deliverace, theyburied the captain that night with greatprivacy, in the trench, along with his troopof robbers ; and a few days afterwards. AHBaba celebrated the marriage of his son andMorgiana with a sumptuous entertainment;and every one who knew Morgiana, saidshe was worthy of her good fortune, andhighly commended her master’s generosi¬ty toward her.During a twelvemonth Ali Baba forboreto go near the forest, but at length his cu¬riosity incited him to make another jour¬ney. \V hen he came to the cave, he sawno footsteps of either men or horses ; andhaving said, Open, Sesame, he went in, andjudged by the state of things deposited inthe cavern, that no one had been there24jince the pretended Cogia Hassan had re¬moved the merchandise to his shop in thecity. Ali Baba took as much gold homeas his horse could carry ; and afterward*he carried his son to the cave, and taughthim the secret. The secret they handed’down to their posterity; and using theirgood fortune with moderation, they livedin honour and splendour, and served withdignity some of the highest offices of the*rity.

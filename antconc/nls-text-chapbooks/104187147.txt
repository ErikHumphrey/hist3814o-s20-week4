Hewas afterwards beguiled by Worldly-wiseman ;but was again put right way by Evangalist.Christian at length arrived at the gate, uponWinch was inscribed “ knock and it shall be op-e knocked and it was opened by oneGoodwill, who let him in. Beelzebub as he en¬tered gave him a pull but Christian escaped.Christian having fairly escaped Beelzebub'*na his emissaries; was kindly welcomed byGood-will, and shewed many rare sights by In¬terpreter : he passed the walls of salvation andcame to a cross, where his bundle dropped off.Christian now being rid of his burden, pushedon more lightly, and took the narrow path up thehill, and struggled hard till he arrived at the ar¬bour, prepared by the Lord of the place for wearypilgrims, where he sat and refreshed himself 't8When Christian had got to the top of the hillho met two men running, named Timorous andMistrust; who said they had been bound forMount Zion, but meeting with two Lions, theywere afraid: Christian passed the Lions, who,being chained, could not hurt him,-4.9tesitonuBiwSii!!HpiliiiSWhen Christian lift up his eyes, he beheld thealace of Beautiful; and after a few interrogaions, was admitted by a damsel called Dis¬cretion, who with her two sisters, Piety andprudence, he held a long conversation.10After leaving these good damsels, ChristianMassed on his way; and in the middle of thevalley of Humiliation, he met with Apollion,ith whom he had a bloody struggle; Apollion' tirowing darts as thick as hail: but at last Christ*.an overcame.11Now at the end of this valley was another cal¬led the valley of the shadow of death ; in themidst of which he perceived the mouth of hell;from which flame and smoke issued out in suchabundance, that he was obliged to put up hissword ami betake himself to All-prayer.Shortly after this he came up with Faithful Jwith whom he held sweet converse till they cameto Vanity Fair. A merchant asking what theywould buy, they said the truth; which he tookamiss, and raised a hubbub; so that they wrereboth taken up and put in a cage, for public viewChristian and Faithful were brought before Mr.Hategood, to stand their trial. Envy, Super¬stition, and Hypocrisy, were brought forwardas evidences, who did not fail to tell a partialstory ; which a partial jury confirmed; and Faith¬ful was condemned to die at the stake.r intliful was then brought out and suffered atthe take: Tims came he to his end, but therestood behind the multitude a chariot, and horsesinto which he was taken up and carried throughthe clouds. Christian escaping went on his way- y_.-15Christian soon fell in'with Hopeful, anotherpilgrim, with whom he journeyed ; and they hav¬ing slept in the policies of Doubting Castle, weretaken prisoners, by Giant Despair, who treatedthem harshly: a key found in Christians bosom,opened the doors, and they made their escape.Having escaped from Giant Despair, they soonmet with the Shepherds of the Delectable Moun¬tains. Leaving this country, they came to theenchanted ground, where they fell in with someof the shining inhabitants, of the City17Christian and Hopeful drawing nigh to tin-elistial City, beheld the streets were paved wit •are gold, but there was a very deep river throughhich they must pass the Pilgrims were alarmedml begun to sink; but rose again ana were wev-omed on the other side by two glorious persons18Christians wife and children wept for himuntil a heavenly messenger gave her a letter tofollow her husband, and live with him for ever.At first she was overcome, but taking the roadwith all her children they fell in with Mercy, andwent toward the wicket gate.19After they had got safely though the Sloughof Despond, they arrived at the gate, where theyknocked a long time, till at length the keepercalled out “ Who’s there,” and opened the gate,and taking Christiana by the hand welcomed themsaying “ Suffer little children to come unto me.20With some difficulty Mercy was admitted, andthey safely arrived at Interpreter’s house; sup¬per being ready, and thanks given, they partookof a hearty repast; Interpreter asked how shebecame a pilgrim, she said, it was by the loss ofher husband, and a letter from the King of Zion.In the morning they were much refreshed.Greatheart was sent along with them to guidethem on their way. They passed the placewhere the load fell from Christian’s back; andcame to the place where Simple, Sloth, and Pre¬sumption were hanging in chains.99They soon arnved at the Hill of Difficulty;Greatheart shewed them the spring where Christ¬ian drank; they then begun to ascend the hill, butChristiana began to pant and want rest; butGreatheart encouraged them, telling them theywere near the Arbour, where they would find rest.23Being refreshed at the Amour, and approach¬ing Doubting Castle, Greatheart determined tolevel it with the ground. Hfe and the giant had asevere fight, but the giant was overcome. Theythen demolished the Castle, and released manyprisoners, where many strang sights were seen.24They still persevered on in their journey bjthe straight way, and narrow path of pilgrims;occasionally meeting with difficulties and encounagement, till they arrived at the land of Beulalijwhere the sun shines night and day; and her;they betook themselves to rest.Now while they lay here there was a post cam ;from the Celestial City, with a letter to Christiianna: the contents were “Hail good womamI bring thee good tidings that the master callet'for thee, and expecteth that thou shouldst staiwin his presence within these ten days.”Now the day drew on that Christiana mustkgone. So the road was full of people to see hetake her journey. So she came forth and entered the river with a beckon of farewell to thoethat follow her to the river side. . The last wordshe was heard to say, were, “ I come, Lord, tbe with thee, and bless thee.”So her children and friends returned to theiiplace; for those that, waited for Christiana haicarried her out of their sight. So she went an1called and entered in at the gate with all tb-ceremonies of Joy that Christian had done before her.FINIS.

PH do that thing,”And clapp’d his thumb upon her money !Gimlet eye—sausage-nose--Pat so sly, ogle throws,Leering, titt ring, fritt’ring ;Sweet Widow Leary !All the sweet faces. See.When Pat had thus his fortune made.He pressed the lips of Mrs Leary ;And mounting straight a large cockade !In captain's boots struts Paddy Carey !He grateful prais’d her shape, her back,To others like a dromedary ;Her eyes, that seem’d their strings to crack,Were Cupid’s darts to Captain Carey !Nate and sweet—no alloy—all complete—love andjoy.Ranting, roaring, soft adoring,Dear Widow Leary;All the sweet faces at Lim’rick races,From Mullinavat to Magherafelt ;At Paddy’s promotion sigh and melt;The sowls all cry, as the groom struts by,“ Och ! cushlamacree, fhou art lost to me,The jolly boy, the darling boy!The lady’s toy, the widow’s joy !.ong sword-girted, neat short-skirted, head crept,whisker-chopp’d, Captain Carey !O sweet Paddy!Beautiful Paddy!Phite-feathered, boot-leathered, Paddy Carey !jftJessie, the Flow'r o’ Dumblane.he sun has gane down o’er the lofty Benlomond,And left the red clouds to preside o’er the scene,ile lanely I stray in the calm simmer gloaming,To muse on sweet Jessie, the flow’r o’ Dumblane.ow sweet is the rose wi’ its saft faulding blossom.And sweet is the birk wi’ its mantle o’ green ;et sweeter, an’ fairer, an’ dear to this bosom.Is lovely young Jessie, the flow’r o’ Dumblane.ie’s modest as ony, and blithe as she's bonny.For guileless simplicity marks her its ain;n' far be the villain, divested o’ feeling,Wha’d blight in its bloom the sweet flow’r o’Dumblane.ing on, thou sweet mavis, thy hymn to the e’ening,Thou’rt dear to the echoes o’ Calderwood glen;dear to this bosom, sae artless and winning.Is charmingyoung Jessie, the flow’r o’ Dumblane.ow lost were my days till I met wi’ my Jessie,The sports o’ the city seem’d foolish and vain ;ne’er saw a nymph I could ca’ my dear lassie.Till charm’d wi’sweet Jessie, the flow’r o’ Dum¬blane.ho' mine were the station o’ loftiest grandeur.Amidst its profusion I’d languish in pain ;n’ reckon as naething the height o’ its splendour,Ifwanting sweet Jessie, the flow’r o’ Dumblane.166Dulce Domum.Dee.p in a vale a cottage stood.Oft sought by travelers weary.And long it prov’d the bless’d abode,Of Edward and of Mary.For her he chas’d the mountain goat.O’er Alps arid Glaciers bounding;For her the chamois he would shoot.Dark horrors all surrounding.But evening come.He sought his home.And, anxious, lovely woman.She hail'd the sight.And ev’ry night.The cottage rung.As they sung,Oh ! dulce, dulce domum.But soon, alas ! this scene of blissWas chang’d to prospect dreary ;For war and honour rous’d each Swiss,And Edward left his Mary.To bold St Gothard s height he rush’d,’Gainst Gallia’s foes contending;And by unequal numbers crush’d.He died his land defending.The evening come.He sought not home.Whilst she—distracted woman—Grown wild with dread.Now seeks him dead.And hears the knellThat bids farewellTo dulce, dulce domum.7Tom Starboard.!£>Tom Starboard was a lover true.As brave a tar as ever sail’d;The duties ablest seamen do>Tom did, and never yet had fail’d.Fut wreck’d, as he was homeward bound.Within a mile of England’s coast,Love sav’d him sure from being drown’d.For all the crew but Tom were lost.Ilis strength restor’d, Tom hied with speed,True to his love as e’er was man ;Nought had he sav'd, nought did he need.Rich in the thoughts of lovely Nan.But scarce five miles poor Tom had gain’d.When he was press’d ; he heav’d a sigh.And said, though cruel was his lot.Ere flinch from duty he would die.In fight Tom Starboard knew no fear;Nay, when he’d lost an arm, resign’d.Said, love for Nan, his only dear.Had sav’d his life, and fate was kind.The war being ended, Tom return’d,His lost arm serv’d him for a joke.For still his manly bosom burn’dWith love, his hear t was heart of oak.Ashore in haste Tom nimbly ran.To cheer his love, his destin’d bride;But false report had brought to Nan,Six months before, that Tom had died.AVith grief she daily pin’d away.No remedy her life could save.And Tom arriv’d the very dayThey laid his Nancy in her grave.8Willie Brew’d a Peck o’ Maut.O Willie brew’d a peck o' maut.And Rob and Allan cam to see,Three blyther hearts, that lee ]ang night.Ye wadna found in Christendie.We are na fou, we’re nae that fou,But just a drappie in our ee ;The cock may craw, the day may daw.And ay we’ll taste the barley bree.Here are we met, three merry boys.Three,merry boys I trow are we;‘And mony a night we’ve merry been,And mony mae we hope to be !We are na fou, &c.It is the moon, I ken her horn,^That’s blinkin in the lift sae hie;She shines sae bright to wyle us harae.But by my sooth she’ll wait a wee!We are na fou, &c.Wha first shall rise to gang awa,A cuckold, coward loun is he !Wha first beside his chair shall fa’,He is the king amang us three !We are na fou, &cyFINIS.It

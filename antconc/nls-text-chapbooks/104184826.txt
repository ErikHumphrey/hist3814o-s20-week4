The next thing that did Sawny good,was three mutckins o’ milk made in t.hinbrofe, and a fine pickle peper in them ;yet he had a fc ughing in his lugs like alaw-raill, and every thing ran round aboutwi’ him a’ that day. Yet his mother gothim cut o’ the bed, on o’ the raeikle chair.C is )a pair o’ blankets about his ftiouiders, acod at his back, and a het brick to his foies,to gar him true he was nae well; and therehe fat like a lying-in wife, cracking likea Hollander, and ate twa dead herrin’ anda cufe, telling a’ the outs and ins abouthis bridal, and whan it was to be ; for hehad gotten every body’s confent but thebride’s about it.Mltb.

far.cy.At eight we all got under weigh,and bid a long adieu to Nancy.3Night eanses and bow eight hcHs had ru;ig:whers* careleM sailors ever cht.etiy,On the ®ia.warch so jov;£l suttg,with temper*, labour canno weary ;I little to their mirth iiHi-.’ci■while tender thoughts rush’d on my fatrey,And my warm aigha i cr as’' the wind,look’d en the moon & thought on Nancy.And now arriv’d that jovial night,when ev’ry true-breo tar carouses ,When o’er the grog all hand# delight,to tQSS their sweethearts and their spouses.Round went the cup, the jest, the glee.white tender wishes fill’d each fancy,And when in turn it came to m*,I heav’d a sigh and toasted Naacy.Next morn a storm came on at four,at six the eleatenta in motion.Plung’d me. and three poor tailors more,headlong within the

seven up channel how- we bore,wMk- hopes aed fears rush’d on my fancy,At twelve I gaily jump d ashore,and to my throbbing heart press’d Na^cy.TAK YOUR ULD CLOAK ABOUT YE-In winter when the ;ain rain’d

with no legs for his hose,Could not see through thespectacles putonhisnose;With no teeth in his head, so death cork’d up hischin;He slipp’d out of his slippers, and faith I slipp’d in,And succeeded poor Dennis of Ballyporeen.DAINTIE DAVIE.THE lasses fain wad ha’e frae meA sang to keep them a’ in glee,While ne’er a ane I ha’e to gie,But only Daintie Davie.I learn’d it early in my youth,When b irley bannocks caus’d a drouth,Whar cronies met to weet their mouth,Our sang was Daintie Davie,O, Daintie Davie is the thing,I never Went a canty spring,That e’er deserv’d the Highlan’ fling,Sae weel as Daintie Davie.When friends and foyk at bridals meet,Their drouthy mou’s and craigs to weet,The story canna be completeWithout they’ve Daintie Davie.8Sac, ladies, tune your spinnets weel,An’ lilt it up wi’ all your skill,There’s nae strathspey nor Highland redComes up to Daintie Davie.O, Daintie Davie, &e.Tho’ bajdies a’ in former times,Ha’e stain’d my sang, wae worth their rhymes 1They had but little mense, wi* crimesTo blast my Daintie Davie.The rankest weeds the garden spoil,When Labour tak’s the play a while,The lamp gaes out for want o’ oil,And sae it far’d wi’ Davie.O, Daintie Davie, Sec.There’s ne’er a bar but what’s complete,While ilka note is ay sae sweet,That auld an’ young get to their feet,When they hear Daintie Davie.Until the latest hour of time,When Music a’ her power shall tine,Each hill an’ dale, an’ grove shall ring,Wi’ bonnie Daintie Davie.O, Daintie Davie, &c.F I N 1 S,

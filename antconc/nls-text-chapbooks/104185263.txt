And you manwho have the ftolen Bible in your hand, open thedoor and let her out;” then a woman rofe who neverwas fufpefted for any fuch thing, and with great hor¬ror and trembling (he cried out, that (he was the per-fon he meant, and fo daggered to the door where theman with the ftolen Bible (being convifled alfo) mether and open’d the door, fo they went both out to-gether-At this the woman’s hufband was highly inragedagainft Mr. Logan, for giving his wife the name of aWitch, and would have him to make it out, or fufferfor what he had faid, but Mr, Logan foon clearedhim( 4 >himfclf, by telling him he named no perfon, but fpoketo all ia genera', (hough to a Wirch in particular, andthat his wife’s confcience only condem’d herfelf, andmade her confefs ii openly before the congregation.Another time he being at a Solemnity in the northcountry, as he was ferving a Table, looking veiy ear-redly in -n the communicants he faid, there is cer¬tainly . J' das here v.'ho thinks to betray the partakersof this bieflbd Table by ihe inchantments of the devil,but O Lord Jefus bring thou their hidden treachery toan open light, and the aftors to open fhame,” thefewords he no fooner uttered, than a woman who hadconcealed a piece of the bread in her bofom was feizedwith great fear and trembling fo that fine gave it againto one of the elders, and told (he was defired to do itby one of her neighbours, who was to communicatethat day, hut would not come up while Mr. Loganwas prefent, that woman being brought before Mr.Logan, and the other woman aifo, (lie who employedthe other to ffeal it, told (he had afked a favour fromthe devil, and he would not grant it unlcls (he goti'.im a piece of bread from the Lord’s Table after it wasconfecrated.1* was obferved by his fervants for the I pace of fouryears before his death, he had the following words inhis piayer, O Lord ftrengthen thy fmall remnant, theproteftan s in France and Germany for thefe evil daysthat is coming upon them, days of perfecution, ofdeftru£Mcn, blood-fhed, hunger and cleanneL of teeth;Lord give them thy fpirit inwardly to (land up withboldnefs for ihy caufe, and contend for the faith oncedelivered to the Saiats; fend them O God a leader anddefender, who will repel the powers of Popery, bringdown the land of graven Images and abo!i(h the tem¬ples of their I iol-gods. His aftonifhing foreknow¬ledge ah J prediction of the man’s fate going to Clack^mm nan and his amazing difeovery and conviftionof the witch and holder of the ftolen Bible are no-torioully known to many yet alive: and his predic¬tions concerning the King of Pruffia’s becoming icham*il( 5- )c’nafflpion for the proteft.mt faith.—The many cala¬mities which be foretold, fhould befall the church ofScotland are ulfo verified in the many Schifms and He-refics in doftriae and difcipline which have crept intothe fame, aod which have occalioned the many divi*fions which have happened there licce the clofe of Mr.Logan’s days. Time would fail us to give a particu¬lar defcription of all thole Hercfies, their rife and pro-grefs, fruits and cfFefta.

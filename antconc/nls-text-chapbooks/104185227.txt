The king was resolved to see hirjand be acquainted with him, in order to whi Jhe immediately knocks the heel of his shoe 11hitting it against a stone, and having so donjhe bounced at the cobbler’s stall.W ho’s there ? cries the cobbler.Here’s one, cries the king. With that tljcobbler opened the stall door, and the king askelhim if he could put the heel on his shoe.4es, that 1 can, says the cobbler : come iijhonest fellow, and sit thee down by me, and Iwill do it for thee straight, the cobbler scrapinlhis awls and old shoes to one side to make roorlfor the king to sit down.The king being hardly able to forbear lauglling at the kindness of the cobbler, asked him Ithere was not a house hard by that sold a cup <|ale, and the people up ?Yes said the cobbler, there is an inn over rlilway, where I believe the folks are up, for thlcarriers go horn thence very early in the morninglWith that the king borrowed an old shoe <>ithe cobbler, and went over to the inn, desired tl.J5cobbler would bring his shoe to him thither assoon as he had put on the heel again. Thecobbler promised he would; so making what hastehe could to put on the heel, he carries it over tothe king, saying, honest blade, here is thy shoeagain, and I warrant thee it will not come oft insuch haste again.Very well, says the king, what must you havefor your pains ?A couple of pence, replied the cobbler.Well, said the king, seeing thou art an honestmerry fellow, there is a tester lor thee ; come, sitdown by me, I will drink a lull pot with thee;come, here’s a good health to the king.With all my heart, said the cobbler, I’ll pledgethee were it in water.So the cobbler sat down by the king and wasvery merry, and drank off his liquor very Ireely ;he likewise sung some of his merry songs andcatches, whereat the king laughed heartily, andw as very iocund and pleasant with the cobbler,telling him withal that his name was Harry I ud-or, that he belonged to the court, and that il he6would come and see him there, he would makehim very welcome, because he was a merry com¬panion, and charged him not to forget his name,and to ask any one for him about the court, andthey would soon bring him to him; for, said theking, I am very well known there,Ts'ow the cobbler little dreamt that he was theking that spake to him, much less that the king’sname was Harry Tudor. Therelore, with agreat deal of confidence, he stands up and puts offhis hat, makes two or three scrapes with his foot,and gives the king many thanks, also telling himthat he was one of the most honest fellows heever met with in all his life time, and althoughhe never had been at court, yet he should not belong before he would make a holyday to comeand see him.Whereupon the king, paying for what theyhad drunk, would have taken his leave of thecobbler ; but he, not being willing to part withhim, took hold of his hand, and said, by my faithyou must not go, you shall not go, you shall firstgo and see my poor habitation, I have there atub of good brown ale that was never tappedyet, and you must go and taste it, for you arethe most honest blade I ever met withal, and I/love an honest merry companion with all myCHAP. II.Plow the Cobbler entertained the King in hiscellar, and of the disturbance they had like tohave had by his wife Joan.So the cobbler took the king with him overthe way, where he had his cellar adjoining thestall, w hich was handsomely and neatly furnishedfor a man of his profession. Into the cellar hetook the king; there, said he, sit down, you arewelcome ; but I must desire you to speak softly,for fear of waking my wife Joan, who lies hardby, (shewing the king a close bed made neatlyup at one corner of the cellar, much like a clos¬et,) for if she should wake she will make our earsring again.At which speech of the cobbler's the king-laughed, and told him he would be mindful andfollow7 his directions.Whereupon the cobbler kindled up a fire, and8fetched out a brown loaf, from which he cut alusty toast, which he sat baking at the fire; thenhe brought out his Chesire cheese. Now, sayshe, there is as much fellowship in eating as indrinking.Which made the king admire the honest free¬dom of the cobbler. So having eaten a bit thecobbler began. A health to all true hearts andmerry companions; at which the king smiled,saying, friend I’ll pledge thee.In this manner they ate and drank togethertill it was almost break of day ; the cobbler be¬ing very free with his liquor, and delighting theking with several of his old stories, insomuch thathe was highly pleased with the manner of hisentertainment; when, on a sudden, the cobbler’swife Joan began to awake. I’faith, says the cob¬bler, you must begone, my wife Joan begings to jgrumble, she’ll awake presently, and I would not |for half the shoes in my shop she should find youhere.Then taking the king by the hand, he led himup the stairs, saying, farewell honest friend, itshan’t be long before 1 make a holyday to comeand see thee at court.9Thou sluilt be Icimily welcome, replied theking-.So they parted the king on his way to White¬hall, and the cobbler to his cellar, and there put¬ting all things to rights before his wife Joan gotup, he went to work again, whistling and singingas merry as he used to be, being much satisfiedthat he happened on so good and jovial a com¬panion, still pleasing himself in his thoughts howmerry he should be when he came to court.CHAP. III.How the Cobbler prepared himself to go to court,and how he was set out in the best manner byhis wife Joan.Now as soon as the king came home, he sentout orders about the court, that if any one en¬quired for him by the name of Harry Tudor,they should immediately bring him before him,whatever he was, without any further examina¬tion.The cobbler thought every day a month till10fie had been at court to see his new acquaintance,and was troubled how he should get leave of hiswife Joan, for he could not get without her know¬ledge, by reason he did resolve to make himselfas fine as he could, for his wife always keepedthe keys ol his holyday clothes; whereupon oneevening, as they sat at supper finding her in avery good humour, he began to lay open hismind to her, telling her the whole story of theiracquaintance, repeating it over and over again,that he was the most honest fellow that ever hemet withal. Husband, quoth she, because youhave been so ingenious as to tell me the wholetruth, I will give you leave to make a holyday,for this once you shall go to court, and I willmake you as fine as I can.So it was agreed that he should go to courtthe next day ; whereupon Joan rose betime thenext morning to brush up her husband’s holydayclothes, and made him as fine as she could. Shewashed and ironed the lace-band, and made hisshoes shine that he might see his face in them;having done this she made her husband rise andpull of his shirt. Then she washed him withwarm water from head to foot, putting on him aclean shirt; afterwards she dressed him in hisholyday clothes, pinning his laced band in prim.liCHAP. IV.The Cobbler’s reception at court, with the man¬ner of his behaviour before the King.The Cobbler being thus set forth, he struttedthrough the street like a crow in a gutter, think¬ing himself as fine as the best of them all.In this manner he came to the court, star-iig on this body and that body as he walked upmd down, and not knowing hour to ask for HarryTudor. At last he espied one, as he thought,in the habit of a servant-man, to whom he madehis address, saying.Dost thou hear, honest fellow, do you knowone Harry Tudor who belongs to the court.Yes, said the man, follow me, and I will bringvou to him.JWith that he had him presently up into theguard chamber, telling one of the yeomen of theguard there was one that enquired for Hairy Tu¬dor.12The yeoman replied; I know him very well;it’ you please to go along with me, I'll bring youto him immediately,So the cobbler followed the yeoman, admiringvery much the prodigious finery of the roomswinch he carried him through. He thoughtwithin himself, that the yeoman was mistakeninthe person whom he inquired for; for, said l:e,lie whom I look for is a plain, merry, homstfellow, his name is Harry Tudor; we drank tvopots together not long since. 1 suppose he msybelong to some lord or other about the court.»I tell you, friend, replied theyoeman, 1 knowhim very well, do you but follow me, and I shallbring you to him instanly.So going forward, lie came into the roomwhere the king v, as accompanied by several ofhis nobles, who attended him.As soon as the yeoman had put up by the ar¬ras, he spoke aloud, may it please your Majesty,here is one that inquires for Harry Tudor.The cobbler hearing this, thought he had com¬mitted no less than treason : therefore he up withhis heels anti ran for it : but not being acquain¬ted with the several turning and rooms throughwhich he came, he was soon overtaken andbrought before the king, whom the cobbler littlethought to be the person he inquired after, there¬fore in a trembling condition, he fell down on hisknees, saying.May it please your Grace, may it please yourHighness, I am a poor cobbler, who inquired forone Harry Tudor, who is a very honest fellow,1 mended the heel of his shoe not long since, andfor which he paid me nobly, and gave me twopots to boot: but I had him afterwards to my cel¬lar, where we drank part of a cup of nappy ale,and were very merry, till my wife Joan began togrumble which put an end to our merriment, forthat time, but 1 told him 1 would come to thecourt and see him, as soon as conveniently Icould.M ell, said the king, don’t be troubled, wouldyou know' this honest fellow again, if vou couldsee him.The cobbler replied, Yes, that I will amonga thousand.1 hen said the king, stand up, and be not14airaid, but look well about you, peradventureyou may find the fellow in this company.Whereupon the cobbler arose, and lookedwishfully upon the king and the rest of the nob¬les, but it was to little or no purpose : for thoughhe saw something,' in the king’s face whichhe thought he had seen before, yet he could notbe Harry Tudor, the heel of whose shoe hehad mended, and who had been so merry a com¬panion with him at the inn, and at his own cel¬lar.He therefore told the king he did not expectto find Harry Tudor among such fine folks as hesaw there, but that the person he looked for wasa plain honest fellow. Adding withal, that hewas sure that did Harry Tudor but know he wascome to court, he would make him very welcome: ■for, says the cobbler, when we parted he charged ^me to come to court soon and see him, which Ipromised I would, and accordingly 1 have made \a holyday on purpose to have a glass with him.At which speech of the cobbler’s the king hadmuch ado to forbear laughing out, but keepinghis countenance as steady as he could before thecobbler, he spoke to the yeoman of the guard.15Here, said he, take this honest cobbler downinto my cellar, and let him drink my health : andl will give orders that Harry Tudor shall cometo him presently.So away they went, the cobbler being fit toleap out of his skin for joy, not only that he hadcome off so well, but that he should see his friendHarry Tudor.CHAP. V.1 he Cobbler’s entertainment in the King’sCellar.The cobbler had not been long in the king’scellar, before the king came to him in the samehabit that he had on when the cobbler mendedhis shoe ; whereupon the cobbler knew him im¬mediately, and ran and kissed him, saying, hon¬est Harry, I have made an holyday on purposeto see you, but I had much ado to ffet leave ofmy wife Joan, who was loath to loose so muchtime from my work; but I was resolved to seeyou, and therefore I made myself as fine as I could.But I’ll tell thee, Harry, when I came to courtIGT was in a peck of troubles how to find you out ;but at last I met with a man who told me he knewyou very well, and that he would bring me toyou, but instead of doing so, he brought me be¬fore the king which almost frightened me out ofmy seven senses; but faith I’m resolved to bemerry with you now', since I have met you atlast.Aye, that we shall replied the king, we shallbe as merry as princes.Now after the cobbler had drunk about fouror five good healths, he began to be merry, andfell a-singing his old songs and catches, whichpleased the king very much, and made him laughheartily.hen on a sudden several of the nobles cameinto the cellar, extraordinary rich in apparel, andall stood uncovered before Harry Tudor, whichput the cobbler into a great amazement at first,but presently recovering himself, he looked morewishfully upon Harry Tudor, and soon know inghim to be the king, whom he saw in his presencechamber, though in another habit, heimmediate-Jv fell upon his knees saying.May it please your Grace, may it please your17Highness, l am a poor honest cobbler and meanno harm.No, no, said the king, nor shall receive anyhere, I assure you.He commanded him therefore to rise, and beas merry as he was before; and though he knewhim to be the king, yet he should use the samefreedom with him as he did before, when he, mended the heel of his shoe.This kind speech of the king’s and three orlour glasses of wine, made the cobbler be in asgood humour as before, telling the king severalof his old stories and singing some of his bestsongs, very much to the satisfaction of the kingand all his nobles.THEcobbler’s songIN THEKING’S CELLAR.( ome let us drink the other pot,our sorrows to confound ;18We’ll laugh and sing before the King,so let his health go round;For I am as bold as bold can be,no cobbler e’er was ruder;Then here g'ood fellow' here’s to thee,( remembering Harry Tudor.)When I’m at work within my stall,upon him I will think ;His kindness I to mind will call,whene’er I eat or drink ;His kindness was to me so great,the like was never known,His kindness I shall still repeat,and so shall my wife Joan.I’ll laugh when I sit in my stall,and merrily will sing.That I with my poor last and awl,am fellow with the king.But it is more 1 must confess,than I at first did know,But Harry Tudor ne’ertheless,resolves it shall be so.And now farewell unto W hitehall,1 homeward must retire,19To sing and whistle in my stall,my Joan will me desire :I do but think how she shall laugh,when she hears of this thing,That he that drank her nut-brown ale.Was England’s Royal King.CHAP. VI.How the Cobbler became a Courtier.Now the king considering the pleasant humourof the cobbler, how innocently merry he was, andfree from any design ; that he was a person thatlaboured very hard, and took a great deal of painsfor a small livelihood, was pleased, out of hisprincely grace and favour, to allow him a liberalannuity of fo' 'y merks a year, for the better sup¬port of his jouy humour, and the maintenance ofIds wife Joat and that he should be admitted oneof his courtiers, and that he might have the free¬dom of his cellar whenever he pleased.Which being so much beyond expectation, didhighly exalt the cobbler’s humour, much to thesatisfaction of the king.‘20So after a great many legs and scrapes, he re¬turned home to his wife Joan, with the joyfulnews of his reception at court; which so wellpleased her, that she did not think much at thegreat pains she took in decking him for thejourney.ANECDOTE.When Charles II was on a progress throughhis dominions, he was waited upon by the ma¬gistracy of a certain city in the north of Eng¬land. The Mayor had prepared with no littlestudy a splendid oration for so memorable an oc¬casion. Kneeling down to deliver his addressthe worthy Magistrate (wTho was excessively fat)commenced by a feu dejoy of rather a singularnature : whether he deemed an expression of loy¬alty tantamount to a royal salute of the presentday, history is silent: certain it is, Tie felt greatlyembarrassed, and blundered his oration most woe¬fully. “ I have, please your Majesty, begun atthe wrong end,” cried the good Mayor, endeav¬ouring to apologize for the incoherency of hisspeech. “ So I remarked,” replied the facetiousmonarch, “ but I fear the mistake can’t now becorrected :—Rise up, Sir Walter Cannon,”21THE TWO BEAUS.Two very intimate friends, one a painter, (heother a goldsmith, travelling together, were be¬nighted near a convent of religious Christians,where they were entertained with great humani¬ty. As those travellers wanted money to con ¬tinue their journey, the painter, who was a pro¬ficient in his art, offered to work for the monas¬tery. He soon possessed his hosts with a highopinion of his talents, and even inspired themwith a confidence, which they had soon too muchreason to repent.The monks having one night left the sacristyof their church open, the painter and his friendthe goldsmith went in ; and,after taking out ailthe vessels of gold and silver which they foundthere, they ran away as fast as possible. Poss¬essed of so great a booty, they determined to re¬turn to their own country. When they arrivedthere, fearing lest the robbery should be discov¬ered, they put all their riches into a chest, andmade an agreement that neither should take anyout, without informing the other.Soon after the goldsmith married, and becamethe father of two children. To supply his ex-pences, which increased with his family, he ap¬propriated the greatest part of the treasure in thechest to his own use. The painter perceived histreachery, and reproached him with it. Theother absolutely denied the fact.The painter, provoked at his perfidy, deter¬mined to punish him for it; but, to be more cer¬tain of his revenge, he pretended to believe everything his associate swore. With this view he ap¬plied to a huntsman, a friend of his, to procurehim two young bears alive. When he had themin his possession, he ordered a wooden statue tobe made so much resembling the goldsmith inevery respect, that the eye was deceived. Afterhaving thus prepared every thing necessary to hisdesign, he accustomed the bears to' eat out of thehands of the statue. He led them every morninginto the room where he kept it; and, as soon asthey saw it, they always ran and eat the victuals,which had been put in its hands.The painter employed many weeks in teachingthem this exercise every day. As soon as he sawthe two bears were perfect in their parts, he in¬vited the goldsmith and his two children to sup¬per. The feast being prolonged till midnight,the goldsmith and his two children lay at theirhost’s. At day-break the painter dexterouslyconveyed away the two children, and in theirplace substituted the two bears.How much was the father, on waking, sur-prised to find them in ids room instead of hischildren! He cried out most dreadfully. Thepainter ran to him, and appeared greatly aston¬ished : <£ Perhaps,” said he, “ you have deservedso great a punishment as this metamorphosisfrom heaven, for some very extraordinary crime.”frhe goldsmith was not to be deceived by whatsis friend said; but being convinced that he was;he author of the metamorphosis, he obliged himio appear before the cadi; and there accused himi)f having stolen his children. “ My lord,” said:he painter, ££ It is very easy for you to know;he truth; order the two bears to be broughtrere; and if, by their gestures and caresses, theydistinguish the goldsmith from the rest of theIrompany, you cannot doubt their being really hishildren.”The cadi consented to make this trial. As soon.s the two little bears, whom the painter hadaade to fast two days before, saw the goldsmith,icy ran to him, and licked his hands. So ex-raordinary a sight astonished the cadi, who was> embarassed that he durst not pronounce sen-mce.The goldsmith confused, returned to the paint-and on his knees confessed his treachery, con-ring him to pray to God to restore his childrentheir natural form. The painter pretending24to be affected with what he said, passed the ni^htwith him in prayers. He had beiore taken awaythe two bears, and in their place conveyed thetwo children, whom he had hid till then. 1 hepainter conducted their father into the roomwhere they were; and returning them to him, jsaid, “ God has heard my feeble prayers, learnfrom this time to keep strictly to your engage-ments.

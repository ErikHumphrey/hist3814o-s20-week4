Of Fancy, maids, beware.Roguish Love took May-day then,And from his wing a feather taken,He dipp'd it in, and changed her pen,And all the Isy seem'd Love's own making.5She wrote of loye with such sweet art,She read, and sigh'd, and lost her heart.Archly jeering, Love was there,And cried, Qf Fancy, maids, beware.The Forester's Daughter.Jewny has been to the village,And brought home a present from Harry ;But though her affection he'd pillage,Blithe Jenny he never shall marry ; *For though she has taken, to vex me,The ribbon ho artfully bought her,She did it in joke to perplex me,Sweet Jenny, the forester's daughter.Jenny has been to the gipsy,Who tcld her we‘re off, and for ever;But sure the imposter was tipsy,As nothing two fond hearts can sever.For though we have tiff'd, when I meet her,I’ll prove like a lover I've caught her ;And the making^up kiss will be sweeter,With Jenny, the forester's daughter.Jenny has cows half-a-dozen,And mine are the sheep in the valley;And though not so rich as her cousin,She's sweeter in temper than Sally :And soon, very soon, we shall marry,Though many more wealthy have sought her;And then he may whistle, poor Harry !For Jenny the foresters daughter.6The Miller's Daughter.| On the banks of Allan Water,When the sweet spring-time did fall,I Was the miller‘s lovely daughter,Fairest of them all.| For his bride a soldier sought her,And a winning tongue had he;J On the banks of Allan WaterNone so gay as she.On the banks of Allan Water,; I When brown A utumn spread its store,There 1 saw the miller's daughter,But she smiled no more.For the summer grief had torn her,And the soldier false was he :' On the banks of Allan W'aterNone so sad as she.On the banks of Allan W'ater,When the winter snow fell fast,Still was s«en the miller s daughter:I ' Chilling blew the blast;But the miller's lovely daughter,Both from cold and care was free ;On the banks of Allan Water,Theiea corse Hay she.Jock o‘ Hazeldcan.‘■ Why weep ye by the tide lady ?Why weep ye by the tide ?Ill wed ye to my youngest son,And ye shall be his bride ;And ye shall be his bride, lady,Sae comely to be seen —I But aye she loot the tears down fa’For Jock o’ Hazeldean.i( Now let this wilful grief be done,And dry that cheek sae pale :!

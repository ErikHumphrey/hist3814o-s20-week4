who did thee send ?I go to raise the brave clan Rose,Their master to defend.For he has slain fierce Donald GrauneHis blood is on his sword,And far, far distant are his men,Nor can assist their lord.And has he slain my brother dear ?The furious chief replies ;Dishonour blast my name but heBy me ere morning dies.Say page where is Sir James the Rose ?I will thee well reward—He sleeps into Lord Buchan’s park,Matilda is his guard.They spurred their steeds and furious HewLike lightening o’er the lea ;They reached Lord Buchan’s lofty towerBy dawning of the day.Matilda stood without the gate,Upon a rising ground,And watched each object in the dawn,All ear to every sound.Where sleeps the Rose ? began the GramieOr has the felon tied ?This hand shall lay the wretch on earth,By whom my brother bled,7Last day at noon, Matilda said,Sir James the Rose passed by.Well mounted on his noble steed,And onward fast did hie.Ry this time he’s in Edinburgh Town,If horse and man hold good ;—Your page then lied who said he wasNow sleeping in the wood.She wrung her hands, and tore her hairBrave Rose thou art betrayed,And ruined by tho. e very meansFrom whence 1 hoped thine aid.And now the valiant knight awoke,The virgin shrieking heard ;Straight up he rose and drew his sword,When the fierce band appeared.Your sword last night iny brother slew,id is blood yet dims its shine ;And ere the Sun shall gild the morn,Your blood shall reek on mine.Y'our words are brave, the chief returned,But deeds approve the man,Set by your men and hand to handWe’ll try what valour can.With dauntless step he forward strode,And dared him to the light ;The Gra2me gave back, he feared his armFor well he knew his might.Four of his men, the bravest four,Sunk down beneath his sword ;But still he scorned the poor revenge,And sought their haughty lord,Behind him basely came the Grscme,And pierced him in the side ;Out sprouting came the purple stream,And all his tartans dyed.But yet his hand dropped not the sword,Nor sunk he to the ground.Till through his enemy’s heart the steel.Had forced a mortal wound.Grreme, like a tree by wind o’er thrown,Fell breathless on the clay ;And down beside him sunk the Rose,And faint and dying lay.Matilda saw and fast she ran,O spare his life, she cried;Lord Buchan’s daughter begs his life,Let her not be denied.Her well-known voice the hero heard,And raised his death closed eyes,He fixed them on the weeping maid,And weakly this replies :In vain Matilda begs a life,By deaths arrest denied ;My race is run—adieu, my love ;Then closed his eyes and died.The sword yet warm from his left side,With frantic hand she drew ;I come, Sir James the Rose, she cried,I come to follow you.The hilt she leant against the ground,And bared her snowy breast,Then fell upon her lovers face,And sunk to endless rest,

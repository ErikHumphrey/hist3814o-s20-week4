It is true we find him heartily employed in al-nioft every corner of the world promulgating er¬rors ; Em .hat may require an hiftory by itfelf.1 think it no injury at all to he Devil to fay thathe had a great hand in the old holy war, as it w^signorantly and tmhufiaftkal'y trailed ; (Erring up theChiiflLn Princes and powers of Europe to run amadding after the Turks and oaracens, and make#warwfh thv/fc innocent people above a t':o Ja-nd mulesoff, only becaufc they entered into God’s heiitagewhen lie had fairly turned it into a common, and laidopen for the next comer ; fpenJirg their nations tmafare, and embarking the.r kings and people (J Gy) ina war above a thoufand miiei off, fiiiii g their head*with that relipi us madnefs, called in thofedays, HolyZeal, to recover the Holy Laud, the fepulchi es ofChrift and the faints, and a* they called faiiely theHoly City, though true religion Gys it was the ai.urfed city, aad not worth fpendirg one drop of bloodlor.This religious bubble was certainly of SaUn, who,a* he ciafily cirtvy them in, fo hk.^ a true dcvii, heleft them in the lurch when th y came there, facedabout to the Saracens, animated the immortal Salacinae,ainft them, at.d managed fo dextroufly, that he leftEtc bonesofabout thitte.noifoa;UcnhuadredtbouiaadA( 5 )Chriflians there, as a trophy ofhis infernal politics: Andafter the Cbriftian world had run al a fanta terra, orin Englifh, a fauntering about a hundred years, hedropr it to plav ano1 h*r game leff fool'fli, but tentimes more wicked than that which went before it ;namely, turning the eruftd e, of the Chriflians oneagainft another; and, as Hudibras faid in anotheri cafe,“ Made them fight like read or drunk,“ For Dame religion, as for punk ”Of this you have a complete account in the hi'doryi! of the Popes decrees againft the Count de Thouloufe*ill and the Wddenfes and ‘MSigenfrs, with the crofadoeai and maffacres which followed upon them; wherein, toI do the Devil's politics feme juftiee, he met with all5 the fuccefs he could defire.

Webelieve tfiere is fuch a thing, fitch a creature as thoDevil; and that he may ftili with propriety offpeech,and without injoftice to his chafader, be called byhis ancient name, Devil.That he is of an ancient and noble original mufl begcknowleigcd , Tor he is heaven born, and of ange¬lic race, as has been touched already. U S riptureevidence may be of any weight in the quell ion. thereis no room to doubt the genealogy of the Devil. Heis not only fookm of ns an angel but as a ftitan an¬gel; one that had be-n in heaven, hid beheld thelace of Gcd in his full effulgence of glory, and fur-rounded the throne of the Moft High ; from whrn~e,commencing rebel, and being expelled, he Was caftdown, down, down, God and the Devil hunfdf onlyknow where : for incited we cannot fay that any manon earth knows ft; and wherever he is, he has, lin-e'■? 1 nun’s creation, been a plague to Sum ; been a.tesa&-A( 8 )ter, a deludter, a calumniator, an enemy, and the ob-jcft of man’i horror and averfioo.How long the Devil remained wandering or con¬fined in chaoi, or how he employed himfelf, hiflory i*filent, and tradition fays but little. Rabbi Judahfays, the Jews were of opinion, that he remainedtwenty theufand years in that condition; and thatthe world would continue twenty thoufand more, inwhich he ihall find work enough to fatisfy his mifehie-vous dtfires: but he Ihews no authority tor his opi¬nion. Indeed let the Devil have been as idle as theythink he was before, it muft be acknowledged, thatrow he is the moft bufy, vigilant, and diligent of allCod’s creatures, and very full of employment too,fuch as it is.As the Devil’s Hiftoriographer Royal has not yatfavoured us with any Publication on his infernalHighnefs, we are left much in the dark for material?,and muft draw them . s inferences from his adtlonirhis we are convinced of, whenanwe come to fpeak of his (hape, or pcrfonality of fub-ftance; and as we (hall have occafion to fay a gooddeal on that fcore afterwards ; we leave the reader,from the credibility of the witntifes, to attach whatdegree of belief he pleafes to it. O.ily we are certainwhatever his pn:/f4nce is as Prince of the Power ofthe Air, it is limited here, and that in two particu¬lars ; /V/?, He is limited from affaming a body, orbodily fh..pes, with fubftance ; and ficondiji. From ex¬erting feraphic powers, and afting with that luper-natural force, which as an angel he was certainlyveiled with before the Fall, and which we are notcertain is yet teken Tfrom him ; or, at moll, we donot know how much it may or may not be diminifh-«d, by his degen'-r tcy, and by the blow' gi’en hint athis expulfton This we are certain, that be his powergreater or lefs, he is rtftrained from exerciling it in<his world ; and he who wxs ouce equal to the angelF- •( 9 )tilled iSc^occtnen in one night, is not ahle noir,without a :,ew commiffion, to take away the life ofone Job, nor touch any thing he hadBut let ui confider him then limited and reftrainedas he is, yet he remains a miglry. a terrible, an im*mortal being; infinitely fuperior to man, as well inthe dignity of his nature, as in the dreadful powers he: retains ftill about him. It is true the brain fick headsof our enthufiaftics paint him blacker than he is ; andas I have faid, wickedly reprefent him clothed withterrors that do not really belong to him; as if thepiwer of good and evil was wholly veiled in him, andthat he was placed in the throne of his Maker, to dif-J| tribute both punifhments and rewards : in this theyare very wrong, terrifying and deluding fancifulv people about him, till they turn their heads, and frightthem into a belief that the Devil will let them alone,if they do furh and furh good things ; or carry themi» away with him, they know not whither, if they do.1 not; as if the Devil, whole proper bufinefs is mifehief,il feducing and deluding mankind, and dr vvi i r them ia11 to be rebels like himfeif, Ihould threaten to fei'/.e uponSthem, carry them away, and in a word, fnll upon themto hurt them, if they did evil; and, on the contrary,i be favourable and civil to them, if they did well. Oathe contrary, we have a clear difrovery,i. That he is the vanqu’fhed, but implacable ene-ij rny of God, his Creator, who has conquered and er-|j pelled him from the habitations of blifs; on which ac-I count he is filled with envy, rage, malice, and all un-charitablenefs ; would dethrone God and overturn thethrones of heaven, if it was in his power.* That he is man’s irreconcilable enemy; not ashe is a man, nor on his own account fmply, not forany advantage he (the Devil) can nruke by the ruin(and deftruftion of man ; but in mere envy at the feli¬city he is fuppofed to enj -y as Satan's rival and as he isappointed to fuceeed Satan and his angels in the polTef-fion of thole glories from which they are fallen*( 1° }Sc Satan looking narrowly into the nature and frameof our fit ft Parents; from the nature of Eve he hadroom to conclude, that flie was of a conftitution ealyto be feduced, and efpecially by flattering her ; raifmg.a commotion in her foul; and a difturbance among herpaffions: and accordingly he fet himfelf to work, todiftui b her repofe, and put dreams of great things in¬to hr head; together with fomething of a namelefskind, which (fowever fome have been ill-naturedenough to fuggeft) I fltall not injure the Devil fo muchas to mention, without better evidence. But 1 onlygive the general hint of thefe thing*, as theyappear recorded in the annals of Satan’s firlltyranny, ^ard at the beginning of hi? government inthe world ; thofc that would be fluore particularly ia-.fqjmed may inquire of him, and know farther.And here, to be fare, began the L>evil’s new king¬dom ; as he had now feduced the two fir ft creatures*he was pretty fure of fuccefs upon all the race andtherefore prepared to attack them alfo, as foe n theycame on ; nor was their incr- afirg multitude avydif-couragrtnent :o bis attempt, but j.ift the central y;for he had agents enough to employ, if every manand woman that (hould be born was to w.ant a Devilto wait upon them, feparately and fiugly to fcducethem ; whereas fome whole nations have been fuchwilling fuhjedts tr him, that one of his feraj,hie impsmay, for aimht we know, have heen enough to guidea whole country ; the people being entirely lubjeftedto his government for many ages, as in -America, forexample, where fome will have it ih-.U he conveyedthe firft inhabicants ; at leaft, if he did uot, we don’twell know who did, or how they got thither.But as to Americans, let the Devil ani themalone to account for their going thither ; this weare certain of, that we knew nothing of them for'many a hundred years ; and when we did, they that.weju fcajo hence found Satan in a full and quiet pof-?fK-5,'3..:.i:■( “ >fcfllon of them, ruling them with an arhitrary govern¬ment, particular to himfelf. He had ltd them into ablind fubjedtion, nay, l might call it devotion (tor itwas all the religion that wastobe found among them);i worfliipping horrible idols in his name, to whom hediredted human facrifices continually to be made, tillj he jkluged the country with blood, and ripened themi up for the deftrudtion that followed, from the invafiortof the Spaniards, who he knew would hurry them alli out of th-: world as faft as ho (the Devil himielf) couldii defire of them.To return to the beginning of things, in the mid ftof his conqueft, he found a checis put to the advanta¬ges ho expedted to reap from his vidtory, by the inv_n mediate promife of grace to a part of the pofterity ot|| Adam, who, notwithftanding the fall, were to be pur-1 chafed by the M ffiah, an d fnatched out of his (Satan’s)ii hands, and over whom lie could make no final con-iiqueft: fo that his power met with a new limitation,and that fuch as indeed fully difappointed him in themain thing he aimed at: viz preventing the beati¬tudes of mankind; which were thus fccured (andwhat if the numbers of mankind were upon this ac¬count increafed in fuch a manner, that the feledlednumber ihould, by length of lime, amount to juft asmany as the whole race had they not fallen, wouldhave amounted to in all ?) And thus, indeed, theworld may be faid to be upheld and continued for thefake of thofc few; fince, till their number can be com¬pleted, the creation cannot fall, any more than thatwithout them, or but for them, it would net haveflood.The fecond exploit the devil achieved was abftrac-ting the mind of Cain, Adam’s eldeft fon, from his al¬legiance to God, who on finding that his brother smore virtuous facrifice was preferred to his own. con¬ceived and perpetrated the Satanic deed of Bute, er-ing rtbel. Tor which God ended Cain, bUfted< ‘3 )his race, and drove them from his prefence —Thus s he Djvil too fuccefsfully pradifcd his wiles onthe /‘.me Jeluvians ; for though Seth, the third Son ofAdam, had Enos, in whofe days we find “ that men“ began to call on the name of the Lord yet intracing the fucceffion of blood in the royal original lineof Adam, brought down as low as Noah and his threeIons, for it continued a feriei or 1450 years, fay fome;1.64c, fay others; in which time, fin .fpread itfelf fogenerally through the wh ie race ; and the fons ofGod, fo the feripture calls t* s men of the righteousfeed, the progeny of Seth, came in unto the daughtersof men, that is joined thsmfeives • > the curfed race ofCain,and married promifcuocfly with them, accordingto their fancies—the women, it feems, being beautiiuland tempting ; and though the .Devil could not makethe women handfome or ug'y in one or other family:,■yrt he.might work up the guft of wicked inclinationson either fide, fo as to make, both the men and womentempting and agreeable to one another, where theyought not to have been fo , and perhaps, as it is oftenfetn to this day, the more tempting tor being under alegal refiraint. Thus having completely debauchedthem the whole 1500 years : he led them to febrn andcontemn Noah, and treat him as a frantic re.i-giousfool for building the (hip in which he and the ftov.k onboard were to fkip over hills, and dance over plains :but foon were they left in the Devil’s lurch; and he,no doubt amrzed and non plufed to guefs what wouldenfue from this inundation.No foc*ier did tfce Devil fee the Ark refling onMount Araret, and Noah, his family, and every liwmg creature del'cend from it; and knowing all hisinfernal work was to begin, that he might again ftrikeat the root, iiftantly commences with Noah, who hadbeen a vetygreat preacher; and. by means of his wick¬ed child Canaan gets him drunk, and fo ftopt h*C H )month ; for we never more hear of h'm after, thoughhe lived a long time.It would be tedious and defultory to trace Satanthrough-all his indefatigable workings to f*duce man¬kind to devil worfhip; and how completely he fucceed-ed till God called Abraham out from among his idolwo»Ih:pping friends, and in his feed eredtrd a church,in which, in fulnefs of time, the Mefliah, who beforehad expelled Satan heaven, was to appear and givehis kingdom a mortal wound. Nor lhali we (hewthe many defeAions in the brighteft luminaries of thatchurch, to the coming of our Saviour ; 'nd it*was, nodoubt, then at a low ebb, though there was a gloriousremnant ot Saints who waited the falvation of Ifrarl,and kept Satan at bay. And this was a more mortalfiab to the throne* principalities infernal, than thecreation of man ; and therefore with this 1 break offthe antiquities of the Devil’s hiftory, or the ancientpart ol his kingdom ; for from fierce downward, weihall find his empire ha* declined gradually ; andthough, by his wonderful addref«, hi* prodigious ap¬plication and the vigilance ami fi Mity of hi* infi' ”-menis, as well human as infern,d and diabolical ;and of the human, ns well the ecciefiafiic a* thefecular, he ha* many time* retrieved what he had loft,and fnmerimrs bid fair for recovering the univerfalempire he once pofTeffed over mankind : yet he hasbeen (till defeated again, repu'fed, and beaten back,and his kingdom has declined in many parts of theworld, aw-i efpeciilly in the nonhern parts. Andwe fh.ill consider how be ha* politically maintained hisinterell, and increafed h;s dominion, among the wifeand righteous generation that we cohabit wi h andamong; which is in fo far,the fu'jeft otthemodernpartof .Satan's hifiory, and of which we aie next to givean account.THSMODERN HIS TORTOF THEDEV I L.PART II.IHav« examined the antiqui iei of Satan’s hiftorr,and brought his affairs down from the creationas far as to our bltffed Chriftian imes: efpeciaUy tothe coming of the Mrflnh, when one would think theDevil could hive nothing to do among ut. I haveindeed but touched at fome things wbi h might haveadmitted of a farther defcription of Satan’s affairs,and the particulars of which we may all come to afarther knowledge of hereafter: yrt I think I havefpoken to the material part of his conduit, as it re¬lates to his empire in this world : what has happenedto his more fublimated government, and his angeliccapacities, I Ihall have an occafion to touch at in fe-veral folid particulars as we go along.The MrfFuh was new born, the fulnefs of time wascome, that the old ferpent was to have his head broken tthat is to fay. his empire or dominion overman, whichhe gained by the f.U of our firft father and mother inParadife, received a downfall or overthrow.It is worth obferving, in order to confirm what lhave already mentioned of the limitation of Satan’spower, that not only his angelic ffrength feetns tohave received a farther blow upon the coming of ■ heSon of God into the world, but lie feems to have hada blow’ upon his intelleds ; his lerpentine craft anddevil like fubtility fc:m to have been circumcifed, and( ‘5 5cut fliort; and inftead of his being To cunning a tal¬low as before, when, as l faid, it is evident he out¬witted all mankind, not only Eve, Cain, Noah, Lot,and ail the patriarchs, but even r.arirns of men, andthat in their public capacity ; and thereby led theminto abfnrd and ridiculous things, fuch as the building• of Babel, and deifying and wcrlhipping their kings,when dead and rotten ; idolizing beafts, (locks, ftonei,any thing and even nothing ; and in a word, when hemanaged mankind juft as he pleafec'.Now, and from this time forward, he appeared aweak, fooiifh.ignorant Devil, compared to what he wasbefore. He was upon almoft every occafion refifted,difappointed, balked, and defeated; especially in all hisattempts to thwart or crofs the mifEon minihry of theiMdfiah while he was upon earth and L:.ntimes uponother and very mean occaftons too.And Sift; how foolifir a projeA was it, and how be¬low Satan's celebrated artifice in like cafes, to putHerod upon finding to kill the poor innocent childrenin Bethlehem in hopes to deflroy Chritl? for t takeit for granted, it was the Devil put into Herod’sthoughts that execution, how funple and foolifli foever;now we nruft allow him to be very ignorant of thenativity himfelf, cr elfe he might eafiiy have guided•his friend Herod to the place where the infant was.This (Lews that either the Devil is in general igno¬rant, as we are, of what is to happen in the world,‘b e¬fore it is really come to pafs ; and confeguciitly canforetel nothing, no cot fo much as our famous oldMerlin or mother Shipton did; or elfe that great eventwas hid from him by an immediate power fuperior tohis, which- 1 cannot think neither, confidrring howmuch he was concerned in it, and how certainly heknew that it was once to come to pafsBiu'be that as it will, it is certain the Devi! knfwnothing where Chrifl was born, or when : nor w<* heable to direei Herod to find him out; and-therefors( 16 )put him upon that foolifh, at well as cruel order, tokill all the children, that he might deftroy the MefEahamong the reft.The next fimple ftep the Devil took and indeed themoft foolilh one that he could ever be charged with,unworthy the very dignity of a Devil, and below theunderftandir.g that he always was allowed to aft with,was that of coming to tempt the Meffiah in the wilder-nefs ; it is certain, that the Devil knew our Saviour tobe the Son of God ; and it is as certain,, he knew, thatas fuch he could have no power or advantage overhim ; how foolifti then was it in him to attack him inthat manner, “ If thou be the Son of God why, heknew him to be the fon of God well enough ; he faidfo afterwards, “ 1 know thee who thou art, the holyOne of God how then could iie be fo weak a Devilas to fay, if thou art, then co fo and fo ?Thecafeis plain, the Devil, though he knew biro to bethe Son of God. did not fuiiy know the myftery ofthe incarnation : nor did he know how tar the powerof Chrift extended, and whether, as man, he was notfui'jeft to fail as Adam was. though his referved God¬head mig •• be ftill immaculate and pure j and uponthis foot, ashe would leave no method untried,he attemptshim three times, one immediately alter another ; butthen, finding himfeif difappointed, he fled.This evidently proves, that the Devil was ignorantof the myftery of goclinrfs, as the text calls it, Godmanifeft in the flelh ; and therefore made that fooiifltattempt upon (Jhnft, thinking to have conquered hishuman nature, as capable ot fin, which it was not: andat this repulfe, hell groaned ; the whole army of regi¬mented Devils received a wound, and telt the fhoek ofit; it was a fecond overthrow to them; they had a longtrain of fuccefs; carried a devilifh conqtieft over thegreateft part of the creation of God : but now theyv ere cut fliort; the feed of the woman was now cometo break the ferpent's head ; that is to cut fliort his( ‘7 )/power, to contra^ the limits -f his kingdom, and ina horriblemanntr, whenever Chrift niet with him; oreU'e very huntble and fubmifiive, as when he beggedleave to go into the herd v.f fwinc, a thing he has ottendone fince.Defeated here, the firft ftratagem 1 find him con¬cerned in after it, was his entering into Judas, andputting him upon betraying Chrift to the chief prieft ;but here again he was entirely miftaken ; for he didnot fee, as much a Devil as he was, what the eventwould be ; but, when he came to know, that if Chriftwas put to death he would become a propitiatory, andbe the great factifice of mankind, fo to refeue the fal¬len race from that death they had incurred the pen¬alty of by the fall; that this was the fulfilling of allScripture prophecy; and that thus it was that Chriftwss to be the end of the law : I fay, as loon as heperceived this, he ftrove all he could to prevent it, anddifturbed Pilate’s wife in her deep, in order to fet herupon her hnlband to hinder his delivering him up tsthe Jews : for then, and not till then, he knew howChrift was to vanquilh hell by the power of his crofs.Thus baffled ana thwarted, the DcvTl relolvcd onthat truly hsllilh thing called perlecution, and armedthe whole Roman empire againft God’s Church i butthough for a long time he was glutted with bloou andfatiated with deftn.’.ftion, yet under Conftantine, theChrift’un Church was eftabliflied and religion flouriih-ed in peace, which continued till the days of Arius,who was fo zealoully opuofed by the orthodox bifhopofth* E .ft, Athanahus, whomiheybaniibtdamirecalledfeveral times, as error ran high, and as the Devil eitherloft or got ground.

Since the conqueft over Eve in Paradife, bywhich death and the Devil, hand in hand, eftablifliedtheir firft empire upon earth, the Devil never gaineda more important point than he gained at this time.Then he drew the Bifnop of Rome to fet up theridiculotu pageantry of the key1; and while he, the De¬vi), fet Open the gales of hell to them all, put themupon locking up the gates of heaven, and giving theBifliop the key ; a cheat which, as grofs as it was, theDevil fo gilded over, or fo blinded the age to receiveit, that like Gideon’s ephod, ail the catholic worldwent a whoring after the idol: and the. Bifliop ofRome fent more fools to the Devil by it, than ever hepretended to let into heaven, thougli he opened thedoor as wide as his key was able to do.The ftory of this key being given to the Bifliop ofRome by St. Peter who. by the way, never had •» hinSrfeif, and.ol its being loll by fomebody or other, (theDevd it feems did not tell them who,) and it beingfound again by a Lombard foldier, in the army ofKing Amtharis; who, attempting to cut it with hisknife, was rniraculoully f need to dircdl the wound tohimfelf, an 1 cut his own throat; that King Antharisand his nobles, happened to fee the ftllow do it, andwere converted to Chriflianity by it; and that theking fent the key, with another made like it, to PopePelagias, then bifliop of Home, who thereupon affom-ed the power of opening and Ihuttir.g heaven’s gates;and afterwards fetting a price, or toll, upon the en¬trance, as we do here at palling a turnpike j thtfe finethings, I fay, were fuccefsfully managed for fomeyears before this I am now' fpe king of; and theDevil got a great deal of ground by it too ; but nowhe triumphed openly, and having fet up a murdereron the temporal throne, and a church emperor upontise ecclefiaftic throne, and both of his^ own choof-ing, the Devil may be faid to begin his new kingdomfrom this epocha, and call it the refioration.( 20 JSince thi* time indeed, the Devifs affairs wrrt vt*jtr.errily on, and the clerpy brought fo many gewgav-sinto their worfhip, and fuch devilifh principles weromixed wi;h that which we called the Chrillian faitha-that, in a word, from this time the Fifhop of Romecommenced whoie of Babylon in the molt exprrtsterms that cottld be imagined ; tyrarmy of the worftfort crept into the pontificate ; errors of all forts intothe profeflion ; and they proceeded from one thing toanother, ttii the very Popes, for fo the B fbops ofRome were now called, by way of dtftmdbon ; I fay,the Popes themfelves, their fpiritnal guides, profdfedopenly to confederate with the Devil, and to carry ona perfonal and private correfpondence with hum, atshe fame time taking upon them the title of Chrift’sVicar, and the infallible guide of the confcfences otChriftlans.This we have fundry inftances of in fome merryPopes, who, if fame lies not, were forcerers, magicians,had familiar fpirirs, and immediate converlation withthe Devil, as well vifihly as invifihly; and by thisipeans became what we call Devils incarnate.Among the inftances of Satan's appearances weJiave the following: Chailes VI, ot France, (urnam-id The beloved: was riding over the foreftnear Mans,a ghafily frightful f*llow (that is to fay, the Devil focli thed in human vij^ot) came up to his hcrie andtaking hold of his hridie, ftopt him, woth addition ofthefe words, “ Stop, king ; w'bethcr go you.

It is truethe king had been diliemp-red in his head before, andfo he might have been deceived ; and we might per¬haps have been led to have charged it to .he ac¬count of a whimfical brain, or the power ot lus ima¬ginations ; but this was in the face of his attendants^frveral of his great officers, courtier, and princes ofthe blood, feting with him, who all faw the man,heard the words, and immediately to then altocitii-( )ment, loft fight of the fpeftre, who vanifhed from themall.Thsfe are fome of the Devil’s extraordinaries, andit muft he conf fted they are not the moft agreeable tomankind; for fqmetime* he takes upon him to diforderhis friends vtry much on thefe occafions, as in theabove cafe of Charles Vi. of France ; the king, theyfay, was really ‘^mented ever after, that is, as we vul¬garly, but rot always improperly, exprefs it, he wasreally frighted out of his wit*. Whether the maliciousD-.vil intended it fo, or not, is not certain, thoueh itwas not fo foreign to his partied ,r difpolition if hedid.ft is true Satan miry be obliged to make differentappearan es as the feveral tircumftances of things callfor it; in fume cafes he makes his public entry, andthen he muft fh:w himfeif in h;r habit of ceremony ;in other cafes he comes upon private bufinefs, and thenhe appears in difguife ; in fome public cafes he maythink is fit to t>-‘ incog, and then he appears dreffedala m.-.fque fo they ' / he appeared at the famous dr.Bartholomew wedding at Parn.w' ere he came in dref-feci ke a trumpeter,danced in his habit,founded a levit,and then went out and rung the alarm bell which wasthe fignal to begin the mifficre) half an hour beforethe time appointed, left the king’s mind fliuuld alter,and his heart fail him.if this ftory be not made upon him (for we fh'>uldnot ft nder the L> vi ir would feem, fie was not thoI roughly fitisfied in king Charles IX’s fteadinefs in hisicaufe; for the king, it f • had relaxed a litde oncebe lore ; Satan might be afiaid lie would fall off againand fo pi event the execution O her* fay, that hedid relent immediately after ringing the alarm bell ;but that then it was too late ; the work was begun,andthe rage of blood havn g been let ioofe among thepeople there was no recalling he ord r winch was cx--tcutedfully, for every P.oteftin P^rii. wasihats-.iglitI( ** )butchered, and theyhad been collefled by fair promife*from every corner in France.So long a feries of delufion followed this that eventhe famous do<ffo:j of the faculty at Paris, when JohnFauftus brought the firft printed books that had thenbeen fsen in the world, or at leaft not there, into thecity and fold th-m for manuferipts; they were fur-prifed at the performance, and queftioned Fan ft us a-bout it ; but he affirming they were manuferipts, andthat he kept a great many clerks employed to wt;{ethem, they were fatisfied for a whileBut looking farther into the work, they obfer*ed theexadt agreement of every book, one with another, thatevery line flood in the fame place, every page a likenumber of lines, every line a like number of words ;if a word was mif fp;it in one, it was mif fpeit alioin all; ray, that if there was a blot in one, it was a-like in all; they b. gan again to mufe, how this ffiouldbe? In a word the learned divines, not being ableto comprehend the thing (abd t!'," was always luffici-ent), concluded it mu ft be the Devil; that it was doneby magic and witchcraft ; and that in ffiort, poorFauftui (who was indeed nothing but a mere ptinter)dealt with the Devil.So the learned dodfors, not being able to under-ftand how the work was performed, concluded as a-bove, it was all the Devil, and that the man was awizard ; accordingly they took him up for a magician,and a conjurer, and one that worked by the black art }that is to fay, by the help of the Devil : and, in a word,they threatened to hang him in their criminal courts,which made fuch a noife in the world, as raifed thefame of poor John Fauftui, to a frightful height, tillat Jaft he was obliged, for fear of the gallows, to difeo-ver the whole fecre-t to them.N. B. This is the true original of the famous IV.Fauftus or Fofter, of whom we have believed fuchftrange things, as that tt is become a proverb, asgreat as the Devil and Dr. Fauftus; whereast( 2 3, )poor Fan Hus was ro <5o<flor, and knew no rnsreof th?

See the countill de Rochfon’s memoirs, p. 179.However, though the Devil has been abufed by un-3; -accountable human ingen ity being laid to his charge,I by the blinded and inconfiderate in the mifty days ofP-.pal fuptrftition ; yet, when we have feen the partiesli in thefs three nations agi’ated and infl cmed, and glut-f ting themfelves in blood and ruin,who can we attributeI it to but tiie Devil, whofe known bufmefs, whole great-eft pleafure it is. 'fherefore will any man be fo far aninfidel to the belief of the Dev i’s cxercifing bis ownprofeffion of ftirring up cpnfufion, as to think that hedid not, by the agenc y of Cardinal Richelieu, fend4co;coo crowns at one time, and 60c,eco at another,t to the Scots, to raife an army and march boldly into'England; and did not the fame Devil,by other agents,| remit be o,coo crowns to England, to raife an army to1 fall upon the Scots; that in the coofnfion he mightj crufh the feeds of the reformation ?

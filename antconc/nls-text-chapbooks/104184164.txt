at kirk or at market, or bridals I ween,A braw gaucier bonnet there never was seen.Wi’ a round rosy tap, like a meikle blackbide,It was slouched just a kenning on either hand side,Some maintain’d it was black, some maintain’d it wasblue.It had something o’ baith as a’ bodies may trow',But, in sooth, I assure you, for ought that I saw,Still his bonnet had naething uncommon ava’,Tho’ the hall

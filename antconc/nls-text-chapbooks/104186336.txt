John did speir,Says Thrumtny, Sure ye needna caie,I’ll gae and try to get some mair.Sae down the stair again he goes,To get o’ drink anither dose,Being positive to hae some mair :But still he fand the

does go.John marvelled salr, but didna speirAgain where he did get the beer,For it was stronger than the first,Sae they baith drank till like to burst,Syne did compose themsels to rest1,To sleep a while they thought it best.An hour in bed the hadna beea,And scarcely weel had clos’d their een.Whan just into the neighbouring cham’erThey heard a dreadfu’ din and clamour.Beneath the bed-claes John did cowr,Bnt Thrummy jumpt upon the fioor.11Him by the sark-tail John did hand,Ly still, quoth he, fat, are ye mad.-'Tlmimmy then gaed a hasty jump.And took Johra on the ribs a thump,Till on the bed be tumbled down,In little better than a swoon,While Thrummy fast as he could rin,Set aff to see what made the din.The chamber seem’d to him as light.As gif the sun were shining bright;The vihaist was stanen at the door,In the same dress he had afoie;And o’er anent it, at the wa’,Were ither apparitions twa.Thrummy beheld them for a wee,But deil a word as yet spake he :The spirits seem’d to kick a ba’,The Ghaist against the other twa jWhilk close they drave baith back & fore,A tween the chunk and the door.He stops a while and sees the play.Syne, rinnin up, he this did say,Ane for ane may weel compare,But twa for ain is .rather sair;The play’s na equal, say I vow.Dear brother Thrummy, I’ll help you.'Then wi’ his fit he kicked the ba’,Card it play stot against the -va’ :.12Quick then, as lightning frae the sky,The spectres’ with a horrid cry,A’ vanished in a clap o’ thun’er,While Thrunamy at the same did won’er.The room was quiet now and dark,An’ Thrummy stirping in his sark :Glauming the gate back to hio bed,He thinks he hears a person tread,An’ ere he gat without the door,The Ghaist again stood him before,And in his face did staring stand,Wi’ a big candle in its hand.Quoth Thrummy, Friend, I want to knowWhat brings you frae the shades below ?I in my Maker’s name commandYou tell your story just aff hand ?Fat wad ye hae ?—I’ll do my bestFor you, to let you be at rest.Then says the Ghaist, ’ Tis thirty year.Since I’ve been doom’d to wander here ;In all that time there has been noneBehav‘d sae bold as ye have done :Sae if you’ll do a job for me,Disturbance mair I’ll never gie.Sae on your tale, quoth Thrummy, ITo do you justice sure will try.Then mark me weel, the Ghaist replied,And ye shall soon be satisfied;13Frae this aback near forty year,I of this place was overseer.When this Laird’s father had the land,A‘ thing was then at my command,Wi’ power to do as I thought fit,In ilka cause I chief did sit:The Laird paid great respect for me,But I an ill return did gie :The Title-Deeds of his EstateOut of the same I did him cheat,And stale them frae whare they did 1 e,Some days before the Laird did die.His son at that time was in France,And sae I thought I’d hae a chance.Gif he sud never come again,That the Estate would be my ain.But scarcely three bare weeks were past,When Death did come and grip me fast,Sae sudden that 1 hadna pow’rThe charter back for to restore,Soon after that hame came the heir,And syne got up the reefu’ rair,What sorrow was come o’ the Rights ?They sought them s veral days and nightBut never yet hae they been seen,As I aneath a muckle stane.Did hide them i’ this cham’er wa’,Weel sew’d up in a leather ba’;14But 1 was ne’er allowed to restUntile that I the same eonf’est;But this to do I hadna power,Frae yon time to this verra hour,That I’ve revealed it a’ to you ;And now I’ll tell you what to do.Till nae langsyne uae mony kentThat this same Ldrd the Rights did want ;But now they hae him at the law,And the neist owk th-‘ Laird maun shaw,Afore the Court, the Rights o’s land,This puts him to an unco stand :For if he dinna shaw them there,O’ a’ his lands he’ll be stript bare;Nae hopes has he to save his ’ state.This maks him sour and unco blate ;He canna think whar’s Rights may be.And ne’er expects them mair to see.But now, my friend, mark what I tell,And ye’ll get something to yonrsel.Tak out the stane there in the wa’,And there yo’ll get the le .ther ba’,’Tis just the same that you did see,When you said that you would help me ;The Rights are sew’d up in its heart ;But see ye dinna ui’ them pait,Until the Laird shall pay you downJust fiftv guineas and a crown,»L —15Whilk at my death was due to me,This for thy trouble I’ll give thee ;And I’ll disturb this house nae mair,’Cause I’ll be free from all my care.This Thrummy promised to do,And syne the Ghaist bid him adieu.And vanished, with a pleasant sound,Down thro’ thelaft, and thro’ the ground.Thrummy gade back syne till his bed,And cowardly John was verra glad,That he his neibor saw anee mair,For of his life he did despairWow man, quo’ John, whare hae been,Come tell me a’ fat ye hae seen,Na, bide, says Thrummy, till day-light,And syne I’ll tell you hale and right.Sae baith lay still and took a nap,Until the ninth.hour it did chap.Thrummy syne raise, put on his claes,And to the chamber quick he gaes,Taks out the stane into the wa‘,And soon he found the leathern ba’ $Took out the Rights, replac’d the stane.Ere John did ken whar he had been :Then baith came slapping down the stair,The morning now was calm and fair.Weel, says the Laird, my trusty frien’,He ye ought in our chamber seen ?\16Quoth Thrummy, Sir. I naething sawThat did me ony ill ava.Wee!, quoth the Laird, ye now may gang,Ye ken the day’s na verra lang :In the mean time its calm and clear,Ye lose your time in biding here.Quoth Thrummy, Sir, mind what I tell,I’ve mair right here than you yoursel.Sae till I like 1 hear shall bide.The Laird at this began to chide :Says he, My friend your turning rude.Quoth Tin ummy. I’ll my claim make goodFor here I just befor you a’,'I he Rights o’ this Estate can shawAnd that is mair then ye can do.What! quo’ the Laird, can that he true?’Tis true, quoth Thrummy, look and seeD’ye think that I would tell a lie.The Parchments frae his pouch then drew,And down upon the table threw.The Laird at this up to him ran,And cried, Whar did you get them, man ?Syne Thrummy tauld him a‘ the tale,-as I’ve tald you, baith clear and hale.The Laird at this was fidgin lain,That, lie had gat his Rights again :And fifty guineas down did tell.Besides a present frae himsel.Thrummyhim thanked, an‘ sync his gowdIntil a muckie purse he stow’d,And cramm'd it in his oxter-pouch,And syne sought out his aiken crutch :And, Fare ye weal- I maun awa,And see gin I get thro‘ the sna‘,Weel, fare ye weel, replied the Laird :But how comes it ye hanno‘ shar‘dOr gien your neibqr oc the money ?Na, by my -said, I Sir, quo' Thrummy,When I the siller, Sir, did win,To ha'e done this wad be sin,) &Afore that 1 the Ghaist had laid,The nasty beast had   the bed.And sae inj tale 1 Irear do end,I hope no one it will offend :My nr nge will na assist-me !anger,The dorty. jade somptimes does anger,I thought her ance a gay smart lass.But now she's conie to sic a pass,That .-a* my cudgeling arid wheeling,WjU hardiy wake her out o‘ sleeping ;l'o plague her, mair :1 winna try.But dight my pen and lay it by.ISWILLIAMAND HISLITTLE DOG.A gentleman and lady had a son namedWilliam, who was their delight. His moth¬er educated him herself. She taught himto read, and many other things likewise.He shewed so excellent a disposition forlearning, that he soon became a most charm¬ing child, and his good mamma was quitein raptures at the praises which were con¬tinually bestowed upon him. One eveningafter supper, his good parents supposing\\ illiam to be asleep, began talking abouttheir child. As his bed was in a light clos¬et, which opened into the parlour, he hadan opportunity of hearing all. “ Acknowl-edge,” said Mrs M‘Kenzie to her husband,“ that William is a charming boy. See how19ell he repays our care of him. What gra-tude ! What tenderness ! How well herofits by our lessons ! I never heard him;11 a falsehood ; always cheerful and doc-e ; in lact I dote on him—how is it possi •le not to love so amiable a child ?” “Irant this,” said the husband ; “ but not-dthstanding, you have suffered him to con-ract a habit which will hereafter renderlim miserable.”—“ Render him miserable !ay dear, you frighten me; explain your-elf, I beg, my dear.”—“ Yes,” repliedhe father, “ he is sometimes so passionatehat he will soon strike tho«e who refuse to:omply with his caprices. It is true, helas never so far forgotten himself as to shewis any traces of this disposition, but withns companions, and ihe servants, werejrou to see the imperious manner in whichle behaves, you would be shocked. Inshort, only yesterday (I have now forgot-:en what was the cause of it) he struck Mi-;hael with a stick. His nurse came, andshe could not by any means bring him to•eason. Every day, when we are absent,some such affair takes place. 1 can assurevoh I am extremely uneasy about it.”—20“ ] ndeed, my dear,” said ihe good lady,“ I was perfectly ignorant of this ; we mustpay the strictest attention to his temper. Iwould not have my dear William suffersuch a temper to ruin him ; and if correction is necessary, I can assure you, not¬withstanding my repugnance to it, I wouldsacrifice every thing rather than suffer himto harbour such a disposition.” Williambeing awake, and hearing the end of thisconversation, began to be alarmed. Hewas naturally a good child, and dotinglyfond of his parents. “ No” mamma, fwill not grieve you, nor trouble ydu to cor¬rect me ; it will be very easy for me to de¬termine never more to aive way to passion ;whenever I feel myself inclined to it, 1will immediately' think on what I haveheard to-night.”The poor fellow was not aware of the dif¬ficulties he would meet with in getting thebetter of a bad habit, which is easily acquir¬ed, but cannot be overcome without the most ‘determined resolution and unremitting at¬tention. The very next day he experienc- 'ed this ; forgetting his resolution of the !night before, he suffered the violence of his21temper to cany him to the greatest excess.His mamma had a little dog named Pom-jey He was a pretty little creature, andlad been taught many droll tricks; heyou Id present his paw gracefully, dance ontis hmd legs, and fetch and carry delight-'u!!y. As he was very gentle, Williamvas extremely fond of playing with him.dompey yielded to all liis little master’svhims at times, but ifhe happened to havet bone, or was eating a little meat, hevould never be in the humour for a dance.3ne morning, when mamma had gone out,William wished to have a little play withaim. Pompey had a chicken bone in hisnouth, and was lying under the sofa, to;at it at hie ease. William in vain endeav-) it red to draw him thence. Not being a,)le to succeed, he wished to take the bone•rom him, being the obstacle of his wishes.Pompey growled, shewpd his teeth, andipished by biting. William, in a rage,seized a broom, and gave him so violent aiblow, that he broke his leg. Pompey cried aloud. The child, astonished at thesight of what he had done, was in the ut¬most despair. He took the little dog on4$his knees, csiiresseci it, and the poor little,creature, notwithstanding its pain, seemedsensible of his pity, and licked his hands.“ Wretch that I am” said William, -‘tohave hurt this poor little beast ; I hav-broken his leg, and still he seems fond ofme ; I shall never forgive myself for haveing committed so shameful an action ; mam¬ma will be comming back soon ; whereshall I hide myself? whither shall I go:Ah ! my dear papa, you were right in say¬ing that a passionate temper would be myruin. Poor Pompey ! how sorry I am tha:I have hurt thee !” At this moment mamma returned. What a sight! Her sotsobbing and bathed in tears! Pompe;groaning with pain William’s knees! ShGuessed in a moment what had passed.—“ Punish me, mamma,” said he ; “ indee«I deserve it; how was it possible I coufbe so inhuman ? tell me, mamma, will thpoor dog die?” “No, my son, I wi.not punish you ; you seem already suffiyiently punished; on the contrary, I wirather pity you. I am fully sensible <what you suffer at this moment. It isRevere lesson which you have just received,Id I a<n certain it will go far towards cor-:ting you. 1 make you a present ofmpey, and you must endeavour to rend-his life happy, in order to recompensen for the mischief you have done him ;t let us think of some means to eise the)r little creature. Now I recollect,r. Courtney is to dine with us to-day ;is a very humane and sensible man ; he11 not disdain to dress the wound of thisor suffering animal.” In afew minutesr. Courtney arrived; he dressed the»und ; poor William looked all in con-srnation ; ’ twas he who held the little£ while they bound it up. Every crye poor creature gave went to his heart.He placed him on a little cushion near hisbed, and Pompey constantly ate from hisI hand. At the dessert, if William had a-ny biscuits or bits of sugar, the dog wassure to get the best part. In about a weekPompey was able to stand, but be still re¬mained lame. The poor beast was so grate¬ful for the care of his young master, thathe seemed more than ever attached to him,and followed him every where. Whenev-•44er William felt himseif disposed to be pas¬sionate, he would look at his dog, andthe sight of the broken leg quickly cooledhim. He would sometimes say to his com- .panions, “ You see that little dog; well,i am under the greatest obligations to him •He has been the means of correcting meof a great fault.”It would be needless to say, that herendered the lives of his good parents ex¬tremely happy, who h^d before expressed ,so much uneasiness concerning his temper. ,From that time he gave the.m the utmostsatisfaction by his amiable conduct.']u Tt pni|p..FINIS.

your cheepingYe’re like Mackay’s mare ye brake fairly alFYe’re good enough but ye’re no braw enoughYe’re no sae poor as ye peep Ye’re of sae rnony minds ye’ll never be married.Ye’re never pleas’d fu’ nor fastingYe’re unco good and ye’ll grow fair’'Ye’re sair fash’d hadding naething togetherYe’re no fed on deaf nutsYe’re busy seeking the thing that’s no tintYe’re like the hens ye rin aye to the heapYe’re fear’d for the day ye never sawYe’re best when ye’re sleepingYe’re a sweet nut if you were well crackedYe’re no light where lean a’Ye’re come aff the house of HarletilhimYe soon weary of well doingYe’se get your brose out of the lee side of the boYe shape shoon by your aia shachled feetYour tongue’s nae slanderYour tongue rins aye before your witYe watna where a blessing may lightYe was never born at that time of the year.Young folk may die, but auld folk maun dieYoung ducks may be auld geeseYour meal’s a’ deaghYour head will never till your fathet’s bonnetYour thrift’s as good as the profit of a yell henYour wame thinks your wysen’s cattedYour purse was steeked when that was paid forYour gear will never o’er-gang youYour minnie’s milk is no out ot your nose yet. :■kFINIS.

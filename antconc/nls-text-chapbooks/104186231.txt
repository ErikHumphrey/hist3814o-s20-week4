unperceiv’d was their subtilty.Our Highland battalion,So forward and valiant,They broke from their ranks, and rush’d on to slay ;With hacking and slashing,And broad swords a dashing,Thro’ the front of the English they cut a full way.But, alas 1 to their ruin,An ambush pursuing,They were surrounded with numbers too high :The Mersemen and Forest,They suffered the sorest,Upon the left wing were inclos’d the same way.Our men into parties,The battle in three quarters,Upon our main body the marksmen did play :The spearmen wrcre surrounded.And all were confounded,The fatal devastation of that fatal day !Our Nobles all ensnared,Our King he was not spared j3For of th it fate he shared, and would no longer stayThe whole was intercepted.That very few escapedThe dreadful conflagration of that woeful day.This set the whole nationInto grief and vexation ;The widows did weep, and the maidens did say,Why tarries my lover {The battle’s surely over ;Is there none left to tell us the fate of the day ?I have heard a lilting,At our ewes milking,Lasses a-iilting afore the break of day :But now there's a moaningOn ilka green loaning,since our bra’ Forresters are a wed away.At bught i’ the morning,Mae blytlie lads are scorning ;The lasses are lonely, dowie, and wae ;Nae daffin, nae gabbin,But sighing and sabbing,Ik ane lifts her leglen, and hies her away.At e’en, in the gloamin,Nae swankeys are roamingMang stacks, wi’ the lasses at bogle to play;But dka ane sits dreary,Lamenting hdr deary,die Flowers of the Forest that are wed away.In har’st at the shearing,Nae younkers are jeering j6The bansters arc Iprt, runkled and grey :At fairs nor at preaq^iing,Nae wooing, nae {leeching,Since our bra’ Forresters are a’ wed away.0 dool for the order,Sent our lads to the border !The English for anes, by guile got the day :The Flowers of the Forest,That ay shone the foremost,The prime of our lads lie cold in the clay.We’ll hear nae mair lilting.At our ewes milking :The women and bairns are dowie and waerSighing and moaning,On ilka green loaning.Since our bra’ Forresters are a wed away.1 have seen the smilingOf fortune beguiling;I have felt all her favours, and found her decay ;Sweet are her blessing,And kind her caressing ;But now it is fled, it is fled far away.I have seen the forest,Adorned the foremost,With flowers of the fairest both pleasant and ga\jf)Sae bonny was their blooming,Their scent the air perfuming,But now they are withered, and all gone away.I have seen the morning,With gold the hills adorning,iid loud tempest storming before the middle day;I’ve seen Tweed’s silver streams,Shining in the sunny beams,irow drumly and dark as it rolled away.O fickle fortune!Why thus cruel spoiling ?7hy thus perplexing poor sons of a day ?Thy frowns cannot fear me,Nor smiles cannot chear me,nice the Flowers of the Forest are a’ wed away.JOHNNY COPE.!OPE sent a letter frae Dunbar,!

Thou’s want for naething, mybairn, to get thee ready for marriage.The wooing being over and the daybeing set, Jockey’s mither killed theblack boul horned yea! ewe, that losther lamb the last year, three hens andgule litted stock; to prevent the ripples11pecks o‘ maut masked in the muckieirn, a pint o treacle, to mak it thickerI nd sweeter, and mamier for the mouth ;f ive pints of whiskey, wherein was gar-||c and spice, for raising the wind. Thedjriends and goodneighbours wentalangVi’ John to the kirk, where Maggylanced to meet him, and was marriedy the minister. The twa companiesined thegither, and came hame in aowd ; and at every change-house theylanced to pass by, Providence stopty their proceeding with full stoups,(ottles, and glasses, drinking theirealths, wishing them joy, ten girls andboy. Jockey seeing so many wishingell to his health, coupt up what head got for to augment his health, andar him live long, which afterwardsupt him up, and proved him detri-ental to the same.II So hame they came to the dinnerhere his mither presenting to them apiping het haggis, made of the crecshf the black boul horned ewe, boiled inle meikle pot, mixt with beer meal,nions, spice, and mint. This haggis12being supt warm, the foaming swats ‘and spice in the liquor set Johns belly |a-bizzing like a workng vat. His mither !cried to spence him,and bed him with bthe bride. Pale and ghostly was his 11face, and closed were baith hiseen.Ah! cries his mither, a dismal day in- ipdeed, his bridal and his burial may be ]jin a‘e dav. Some cuist water in herlace and jag’d him wi’ the needle, tillhe began to rouse himself up, then lisp'out some broken words. Mither,mither! cries Jockey, wharam I now?Whar are you now, my bairn, says his.mither, ye are beded, and I’ll bring thebride to you. Beded, says Jockey,and is my bridal done else ? Ayis’t, said his mither, and here is thebride come to lie down beside ye, man.Na, na, mither, says Jockey, I’ll nolie wi’ an unco woman indeed, an itbinna heeds an thraws, the way I liewi’ you mither. O fye, John, says hismither, dinna affront yoursel’ and mebaith, tak’her, in o’er the bed ayont yeand kiss herand clap her,and dauther,till ye fa asleep. The bride fa’s a-cry-ising oot, Omitlier, mither! whar are ye,mither? Poor thing, Meg thou’s ca‘d:hy hogs to a bonny market. A bonnymarket! says Jockey's mither; a shameifa’ you and her baith, he is worthy oJher though she were better nor whatshe is, or e’er will be. His friends and31 her friends being a mixed multitudesome took his part, some took hers,then did a battle begin in the clap ofa hand, being a very fierce tumulti1 which ended in blood; they struck sohard with stones, sticks, beetles, andbarrow trams; pigs, pots, stoups, andand trenchers, were flying like bombsand grenades; the crook, bouls, andtangs, were all employed as weapons ofwar, till down came the bed, with agreat mow of peats ! So this disturbeda’ the diversions at Jockey’s bedding,and the day was beginning to break inthe east before the hurly-burly was over.PART II.Now, though all- the ceremonies ofJockey and Maggy’s wedding were)> ended, when they were fairly bedded1 before a wheen tattling unruly witnesses4who dang down the bed aboon them ;the battle still increased, and John’swrork turned out very wonderful, for hemade Janet, that was his mither’s ser¬vant lass last year, grow like an elshenhaft, and got his ain Maggy wi’ bairnforby. The humsheughs were verygreat, until auld uncle flabby came into redd them ; and a sturdy auld fellowhe was; he stood lively with a stiffrumple, and by strength of his armsrave them aye sunder, flinofncr thelaen east and the tither west, till theystood a’ round about like as manyfbr-foughten cocks and no aue durststeer another for him. Jockey’s mitherwas ca’d o’er a kist and broke a’ herhip on a round heckle, up she gat,and running to fell Maggy’s mitherwith the ladle, swearing she was themither of a the mischief that happenedUncle flabby ran in between them, hehaving a muckle nose, like a trumpet,she recklessly came o‘er his lobster neba drive wi the ladle, till the blood camrinning down his old grey beard, andha'>g like snuffy bubbles at it. O then15«he gaed wud, and looked as woeful likeas he had been tod-1 orie come fraeworrying lambs, with his bloody mouth.With that he gets aivauld flail andand rives awa the supple, then drivesthem a’ to the back of the door, but! nane wan out; then wi’ chirting andclapping of hands down comes the clayhallen, and the henbawk wi’ Rab Reidthe fiddler, who had crept up besidethe hens, for the preservation of hisi fiddle.Ben comes the bride, when she goton her coat, clappet Rabby on theshouther, and bade him spare their lives,jfor their was blood enough shed in aenight, quo she; and that my beard canjwitness quoth he. So they all camein obedience to uncle Rabby, for hissupple made their pows baith saft andfsair that night; but daft Maggy Simp-; son sat by the fire and picked banes a’the time of the battle. Indeed, quothIshe. I think ye’re a’fools, but myself,|for I came here to get a good supper,Hand ither folk hae gotten their skinsTwell paid.16By this time up got Jock,the bride- rgroom that was Jockey before he was :married, but couldna get his breeks;and rampling, he cries, Settle ye, or ^I’ll gar my uncle settle ye, and saftenyour heads wi’ £n auld supple.Poor Rab Reid, the fiddler, took a ^sudden blast; some said he was maw tturned wi’ the fa’, for he bock’d up a’ ^the barley, and then gar’d the ale gae jlike a rainbow frae him, as brown as jwort brose.The hurly-burly being ended, andnaething but fair words and shaking ofhands, which was a sure sign of an vagreement, they began to cow their i,cutted lugs, and wash their sairs, a’ but ^Jockey’s mither,who cried out, A black ,end to you and your wedding baith,for I hae gotten a hundred holes dungin my back wi’ the round heckle teeth.Jockey answers, A e’en baud youwi’ them then mither, ye will e’en bethe better sair’d.Up gets auld Rabby, and auld Sandy,the souter of Seggyhole, and put every¬thing in order; they prapet up the bed !IIti'lwi’ a rake, and ripsling kame; thestoops bf;ing broken, the} made a solidifoundation of peats,laid on the caff bedind bowstcrs, and Jockey and Maggy4 were beded the second time.Jockey not being used to lie wi’ awoman, except heads and thraws wi’his mither, gets his twa hands about4the brides neck, and his houghs outo’er herhurdies, saying I ne’er kist wifefior lass naked before, and for fainness’ll bite you, &c.,Naething mair remarkable happenedtill about half a year and four oukshereafter, when in comes Marionushes, rinning barefitted and bare-egged, wi’ blear’t cheeks and waterynose, cursing and banning, greetingand flyting.(Marion enters, crying,) And whar’sJ ohn ?Mith. Indeed he’s out in the yardDouting kail runts.Mar. A black end on him and hisrunts, for he’s ruined me and my bairn.Mith. Ruined you! it canna be; helever did you ill, by night or by day,18what gars you say that ?Mith. O woman ! our Jenny is a iow- |ing like a pack of woo; indeed she’swi’ quick bairn, and your John is thefather o’t.Mith. Our John the father o’t! hand*there is enongh said, being lown ? Itrow our John was ne’er guilty of sic asinfu’ action. . Daft woman I trow it’llbe but the wind; she’ll hae druckehsome sour drink, raw sowens, or rotten jmilk that makes her so ill.Mar. A wae be to him and his actions 1baith,he’s the father o’t, fornicator dog: Ithat he is, he’s ruined me and my bairnI bore her and brought her up honestly |till she came to you ; her father died, |and left me wi’ four o’ them ; there |wasna aneo’ them could pit on anither’s1claes, or tak a louse of ither.Mith. I bid ye baud your tongue, and !no even your by starts to my bairn, forhe ne’er will take wi’t; he poor sillylad, he wad ne’er look to a lass he’s jto lay her down. Fy, Maggy, cry inJohn, and ane let’s ratifyt wi’ the auld jruddoch; aye, ye’re no blate to say sae. !: 9Mar. Be ano;ry or be well pleased, I’llsayt in a’ your faces, and Illcall yourbefore your betters ere lang gae.John enters.—A what want ye now !our brose ready yet ?Miih. Ay, brose! black brose indeedfor thee, my bairn ; here’s MarionMushet saying ye hae gotten herdochter wi’ bairn.Jock. Me, mither, I never lay in a bedwi’ her dochter a’ my days ; it'll be theyoung Laird’s for a saw him kiss her atLammas fair and let glaum at her,—nonsense.Mith. Ay, ay, my man, Johnny, thatis the way; ’tis no you, nor the like ofyou, puir innocent lad ; ’tis a wheenrambling o’erfull lowns ilka ane of themloups on another, and gies the like ofyou the wyte ot.Mar. Ye may say what you like aboutit, it’s easy to ca’ a court whar there’s naebody to say again ; but I’ll let you kenabout it; and that is she tell’t me, andyou gudewhe tell’t me some o’t yourseh,and gin you hadna brought in Maggywi’ her muckle tocher atvveon the twa,20your Jockey and my lenny wad haebeen man and wife that day.Jock. I weel a-wat that’s true.Mith. Ye filthy dog that ye are, areye gaun to confess wi’ a bystart, and itno yours ? Dinna I ken as weel as yedo wha’s aught it, and wha got thewean.Jock. Aye, mither, we may deny aswe like about it, but I doubt it willcome to my door at the last.Mith. Ye silly sumph and senselessfellow, had ye been knuckle deep wi’ thenasty drab, ye might hae said sae, butye tell’t me langsyne that ye couldnalo’e her, she was sae lazy and lownlike, besides her crooked fit and bowedlegs.Jock. Ay, but mither, do ye mindsince ye sent me out to gie her theparting kiss at the black hole of thepeat-stack.Mith. Na, na, poor simple lad; thewean’s no yours, ilka ane loups on o’anither, and ye’ll get the wyte of a thebystarts that are round about thecountry...;ll21J Cp gets Maggy wi’ a roar, and rives‘tier hair and cries, O her back, heri pelly ! and baith her sides ! The weedand gut gaes through my flesh likeuang needles, nails, or elshin irons!Wae be to the day that e’er I saw hisface. I had better married a tinkler,pr followed the sodgers, as mony an(honest man’s dochter has done, andlived a better life than I do.J Up gets Jockey and rins over the rigsjfor John Rodger’s wife, auld Katty therowdy j but or he wan back, she partedwi’ Patrick through perfect spite, andthen lay twa-fauld o’er a stool in aswoon.I Jock, A-weel, a-weel, sirs, though myfirst born is e’en dead without seeing-he light of the warld, ye’s a’ get breadand cheese to the blythe meat, thething we should a waured on thefuket will sair the burial, and that wille be some advantage; and shouldaggy die, I maun een tak Jenny, thean is as far a length as the tither ;;e be furnished wi’ a wife betweene twa.■iRut Maggy grew better the next dayjand was able to muck the byre; yetthere gaed sic a tittle tatlin throughthe town every auld wife telld anither 1o’t, and a’ the light-hippet hissies that 1• i ^ j • rrins between towns at e en tugging attheir tow rocks, spread it round thekintra, and everybody’s mouth wasfilled wi’ Jockey and Jenny and liow.jMaggy had parted wi’ a bairn.At last Mess John Hill hears of the ^foul fact, and sends the Elder of thatquarter, and Clinkum-Bell, the gravemaker to summon Jockey and Jenny,to the Sessions, and see how the stool'of repentance wad set them. No ;sooner had they entered the door but;Maggy fa’s a greeting and wringing herhands, Jockey’s mither fell a-flyting,and he himself a-rubbing his lugs, and ]riving his hair, crying out, Ogin I were jbut half an ell higher, I sud be a sodgeror it be lang; gie me a guid flail or a Icorn fork, I Wild kill Russians anew, jbefore I gaed to face yon flyting Minis- |ters and be set up like a warld’s wonder, ron their cock-stool, or back stool; andwha can hide the shame when everybody looks to them, wi‘ theii sackensarks, or gown, on them, like a pieceof auld eauvas prickt about a body, fornaething bnt what every body does a-maist or they are married as weel as meAfilh. My man Johnnie, ye're no thefirst that nas done it, and ye‘ll no bethe last; e'en mony o‘the ministershae done it themselves ; hout aye, e'enyour father and 1 did it mony a timeMag. Aye, aye, and that gars yourson be so good o't as he is, the thingshat's bred in the flesh is ill to pit outf the bane.Mith. Daft woman, what way wad thearid stand if folks wadna mak use ofther ? ‘Tis the thino; that's naturalaims getting ; therefore it's no to becunner'd at.Mag. Aye, aye, but an they be forhe like o' that they should marry.Milh. But 1 thnk there's little illhough they try it ance or twice or theye married, ‘tis an unco thing for aody to be bound to a business or theyen whether they be able for it or no.PART III,Aff he gees to the Minister, and owns a’ his faut to him;and Mess John desired him to appear before the congregationthe next Sabbath to be rebuked for his fau’t.Jock. Indeed, sir, I wad think naething to stan’ a time ortwa on the black stool, to please you, if there were naebodyin the kirk, on a ouke day, but you and the elders to flyte awee on me; but ’tis waur on a Sunday to have a’ bodieslooking and laughing at me, as I had been codding the peas,sipping the kirn, or something that’s no bonny.Min. Aweel John, never mind you these things but comeye to the stool it’s nothing when it is over, we cannot sayo’er muckle to you about it.On Sunday thereafter, John comes with Uncle Rabby'sauld wide coat, a muckle grey lang-tailed wig, and a bigbonnet, which covered his face, so that he seemed morelike an old pilgrim than a young fornicator! mounts thecreepy wi’ a stiff back, as he had been a man of sixty.Every one looked at him, thinking he was some oldstranger, who knew not the stool of repentance by anotherseat, unknown but to very few; yet, or the second it becameto be well known, that the whole parish and many more, cameto see him which caused such a confusion, that he wasabsolved, and got his children baptized the next day,—butthere happened a tullie between the twa mothers’ who wouldwould have both their names to be John. A-weel says auldJohn their father to the minister, A-deed, sir, ye maun ca’thetane John and the tither Jock, and that will please baiththese enemies of mankind.Minister. Now John, you must never kiss another woman,but your own wife; live justly, like another honest man, andyou will come to die well.Jock. A black end on me, sir, if ever I lay wi’ anotherwoman, as lang as our Maggy lasts; and for dying, there*nae fear of that, or I’ll no get fair play, if ye and a’ the aulderfolk in the parish be not dead before me. So I hae done wiyou now, fareweel, sir.

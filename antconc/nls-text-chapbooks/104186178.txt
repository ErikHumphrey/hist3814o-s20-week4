I will not tell a foolish storyif gaping crowds and clergy hoary,Vho give this day to wild devotion,nd cross and kneel in strange emotion ;tor all that Popish legends say,\fere acted on this wondrous day.ach stories now are not worth telling,Jut fit for weans that learn the spelling*I Hail! glorious day of Reformation,irhen reason calmly took her station,{hen knowledge spread, and eruditiontfilm’d the eye of Superstition.is 1 what thousands still she tethersnho listen to her wondrous blethers.itWeel I remind on Fasten’s day,ilhen fighting cocks was thought a play;4Now Chanticleer may crously craw,These cruel days are a’ awa.Humanity now holds her reign,Abolish’d is the cursed main ;Save by an idle thoughtless few,Who still these savage sports pursue;An outrage to the God of nature,Who gave to man earth’s every creature.Not wantonly to trample under.Nor tear their hearts and limbs asunder,But only for his moderate use;For why should man thus craw sae crouse,But for kind heaven’s strange ordinationHe had not had so proud a station.Short is his reign, sacred his trust,A reckoning give one day he must;And mercy he can only findWho has been merciful and kind.Quick thro’ the streets the crowds are rinninyFor now the fun is just beginning,Down t9 the cross they all resortTo see the tricks and curious sport.The youngsters there are all a-jouking,De’il give them a’ a hearty drouking;De’il nor they have to wring their sarksThat gangs to see the water warks./But now the Cryer proudly marches,\nd on his halbert high he perchesThe Breeks, the Shoes, the Purse, the Bonnet,jCries come and stake who mean to win it.These were ambition’s valued bays,In ancient happier simple days;But nought with racers now will do,j Save yellow sovereigns one or two,For gold now only is the prizej That glitters in ambition’s eyes.But fancy lain would flap her wing,And Fasten’s varied frolics sing,And hie down to Kilmarnock place,To see old Killie’s far-fam’d race;Or rove about Barbadoes green,And paint the strange and varied scene.As Killie’s stream comes rumbling down.So crowds comes pouring from the town,Recruiting parties proudly stalking,Lads anti lasses busy talking;A ring of Cullans young things coaxing,And here a batch of blackguards boxing;The playful boys at ball or shinty,Are flying swift like ony linty,When fat! a tap comes from the drum,And all those noisy groupes are dumb.4odear, clear the course, for nine are staked,.Lud ! cries a lass, ane’s stripping naked ,*The inuckle de^l- stap out your e’en,The idaii has on his good ankcen ;I ken him weel, an ugiy stirk,It’s Ring, a fellow from Muirkirk.Wba do I see, ns I’m a sinner,Bridgeton’s here, the famous rinner.Stand still ye jades, and keep your place,I’m sure we’ll ha’e an excellent race.Now round the crowd a’ tak. their station.Stretching their necks ill expectation,When affat once the racers go.The knowing ones first tak it slow,But every bout they make it quicker,And in at last come with a bicker;They all then do their uttermostW'ha first shall touch the winning post.Wraes me for him that lags behind.Like some old nag for want of windAnd far more wae for him that fell,And hurt and almost brain’d himseF,But, lack-a-day, there’s nae compassion,To hoot misfortune’s aH the fashion,On life’s high road but get a sprain,There’s fev. will help you up again.Bridgeton last year was just tlie man.Scarce such a racer ever ran,But now he slid and sprain’d his leg,His tinning now’s no worth a pegThus oft it is when virtue halts,That mankind glory in her faults;Instead of counsel you’ll see laugh ip g.Instead of pity thoughtless daffing.O would but man think what betelAnother, may come on himsel’,He surely would not be severe,But learn to shed compassion’s tear..Behold, the ring breaks on the green,ii Again the varied sports begin,| The boys at tig are running jinking,|! And here and there are supple linking t1 They all are playing curious trick.-,J Some throwing turfs or bits of sticks;) When lo ! the drum gives a loud call,IThen forms the ring both young and anld ;’Then all look on with anxious g'lour,(And cry, this race there’s only four.! The shout is rais’d, its King, its King,In vain they push him round the ring,Like some switt ship before the wind,That leaves the lagging fleet behind,8And readies quick the wish-for shore.When toils and dangers ;dl are o’er;Or rapid sportsmen in the chaseThat urges to the well-tfnavk’d place,Nor ever stops, but head-long fliesWhere Puss, or Reynard, trembling dies.So King, op far-fam’d Fasten’s day,In triumph bore the prize away.Let Irvine boast its gay Bogside,With all its Eglintonian pride;Let titled Jockeys all repairTo race and hunt, and course at Ayr .Dearer to me the simple sceneThat closes happy Fasten’s-e’en.No cutting.whip, or ciirsed spur,Shall e’er Kilmarnock Races slur,Nor cruelty, nor shameful crimes,Shall e’er disgrace her sweet pastimes.But Killie long renown’d shall beFor all the virtues of humanity.f’/A'/e

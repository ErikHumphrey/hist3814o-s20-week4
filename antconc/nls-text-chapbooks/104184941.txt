This, if it be well hmdled,hath more admiration than any other feat ol thehand. Note, This may be best done by puttingthe wax upon the t*o-penny piece, but then youmust put it into your hand yourself.To convey a Tester out of one's hand that holds itfast.Stick a little wax upon j-our thumb, and takea standt-r by, by the fingers, showing him thetester, and telling him you will put the same intohis hand, thea wring it down hard with yourwaxed thumb, and using many words, look himin the lace, and as soon as you p, reeive him tolook in your face, or on your hand, suddenlytake away jour thumb and . lose his hand, and itwill seem to him that ihe tester remaineth ; evenas it you ring a tester upon one's forehead, itwill seem to stick when it is taken away especLally if it be wet ; then cause him to hold Ins hand•till, and with speed put into another man’s hand,or into your own, two testers instead of one, anduse words of course, whmeby you sh.il make thebeholders believe, when they open their hands,that by enchantment you have brought both to’jether8'if Cards,' tvhh good caution hole to avoid cozenagetherein, especially Rules to convey and handlethe Cards, and the manner and order how to ac¬complish all difficidties and strangethings wroughtwith Cards.I having now bestowed some waste moneyamong you, I will set you to cards, by whichkind of witchcraft a great number of people havejuggled away not only their money, but also, theirlands, their health, their time, and their honesty'.I dare not as I could, show the lewd jugglingthat cheats practice, least it minister some offenceto the weel-disposed, to the simple, hurt and los¬ses, and to the wicked, occasions of evil-doing:but I could wish all gamesters to beware, notonly of cards, hut also of what dice they play'withal; but especially with whom, and wherethey exercise gaming, and to let dice pass as athing whereby a man must be inevitably cozened.One that is skilful in making bum-cards, may un¬do hundreds of wealthy men, that are given togaming, for if he hath a confederate present, ei¬ther of the players or slanders by, the mischiefCannot be avoided. If you play among strangersbeware of him that seems simple or drunken, forunder their habit the most spacious cozeners arepresented, and while y'.ou think by their simpli¬city' and imperfections to beguile them, and there¬in' perchance are persuaded by' their confederates,which you take to he your friends, you will thenlie most of all deceived. Beware also of the bet¬ters and lookers on, and particularly of them thatbet on your side, whilst they' look on your game,without suspicion, they discover it by signs lo9, your adversaries, with w hom they bet, and yetjf are their confederates.But in showing feats and juggling with cards,: the principal point consisteth in the shufflingj them nimbly, and always keeping one card eitherat the bottom, or in some known place of thestock, four or five cards from it; hereby you shallseem to work wonders, for it will be easy for youto see one card, which though you he perceivedto' d6, it will not be suspected, if you shufflethem well afterwards ; and this note 1 must giveyou, that in reserving the bottom card, you mustalways, whilst you shuffle, keep him a little be¬fore or a little behind all the cards lying under¬neath him, bestowing him, I say, either a littlebeyond his fellows before, right over, the fore¬finger, or else behind the rest, so as the littlefinger of the left hand may meet with it, whichis the easier, the readier, aud better way in thebeginning of your shuffling. Shuffle as thick asyou can, and in the end throw upon the stockthe neither card, with so many more at the leastas you would have preservet' for any purpose alittle before or a little behind the rest, providedalways that your fore-finger ,if the pack lay be¬hind,) creep up to meet with the bottom cardand when you feel it, you may then hold it un¬til you have shuffled over the cards again, stillleaving your cept card below. Being perfecthereip, you may do almost what you list withcards by this means, what pack soever you use,though it consistetli of eight, twelve, or twentycards, you may keep them still together unservednext to the card, and yet shuffle them often tosatisfy the curious beholder. As for example, andfor brevity sake, to show divers feats under one.10To tell without confederacy what Cmd he thinkeikonLey three cards at a little distance, and bid aStan er-b) be true and not waver, but think o*one of the three, and by his e\e you shall assur-enly perce've whtclt he thinktth. and you shalldo the like if you ca-^t down a whole pick of cardswith the laces upwards, whereof there will befew or none plainly perceived, an i thev also countcards: but as you cast them oown suddenly, semust you take them up presently marking bothh's eyes, and the card whtreon he looketh.Hmu to make a Card jump out of the Pack, and runon the’ Table.This is a wonderful fancy if it be well handledas thus:T ike a pack of cards and let any one draw anycard that they fancy best, an i afterwards takeand put it into the pack, but so as you knowto here to find tt at pleasure: for by this time, Isuppose you know how to shuffle the cards, andwhere to find any card when it is put into thepack : th-n take a piece of wax and put it underthe thumb-nail o*' your hand,, and there fasten ahair to the card, then spread the pick of card*open on the table, then say. If you are a purevirgin that card will ju op out of the pac&,” theaby your words or charms seem to make it jumpon the table.11Uotv to tell whit Card any man thinkeih on, andhow to convey the same into a kernel of a nulor cherru stone, and the same again into one's j:pocket, and how to make him draw the same,or any card you please, and all under one device-Take a nut. or cherry stone, and burn a hoi*through the side of the top of the shell, and also,through the kernel if you will, with a hot bodkin,•r bore it with an awl, and with a needle pull•ut the kernel, so as the same may be as wide asthe hole of the shell: then write the name of th«**rd on a piece of fine paper ami roll it up hard,then put it into the nut or cherry-stone, and stopthe hole up with wax. and rub the same over witha little dust, and it wiil not be percitved; thealet some stander-by draw a card saying, ‘ It isao matter what card you draw ’and it your hind*»o serve you to use t.hecrrd well you shall profferhim, and he shall relieve the same card that youhave rol ed up in the nui ; then take another nut iand fill it up with ink. and then stop the holeup with wax, and then »ive th»t nut which is fil¬led with ink to somebodv to crack, and when hefine’s the ink come out of his mouth, it will causejreat laughter.

By this means many other featsmay be do.ne.How to knit a knot upon a Wandkcrchief andto undo the same xvith tvords.'Make one plain loose knot with the tw o cornerends of a handkerchief, and seeming to drawthe' same very hard, hold fast the body ot thesaid handkerchief hear to the knot with your right; hand, pulling the contrary end with your lefthand, which is the corner of that which you hold;then close up handsomely the knot, which willbe somewhat loose, and pull the handkerchief sowith your right hand as the left hand end may1 be near to the knot, then will it seem to be atrue and firm knot: and to make it appear rn.Qfhassuredly to be so, let a stranger pull at the endwhich yod have in your left hand, while you hold* fast the other in your right hand, and then hold¬ing the knot with your fore-finger and thumb,1 and the lower part of your handkerchief with your| other finger, as you hold a bridle, when you wpuldwith one hand slip up the knot and lengthen the[ reins;

then pull the middle button upon the samebeing doubled over his fellow, so will the headsseern to be put over the two cords, you may loosethem as you list, and make it seem manifest tothe beholders, which may not see how they aredone, but that the buttons are put upon the twocords without any fraud, then must you seem toadd a more affectual binding of those buttons tothe sfrings, and make a one half of a knot, withone of the ends of each side, which is for noother purpose, but that when the buttons he tak¬en away, the cords may be seen in the case,which the beholders suppose them to be in be¬fore, for when you have made your half knots,which in any wise you may not double to makeJ 4a perfect knot, you must deliver into the hand*some stander-by these two cords, namely tw#cords evenly set to one hand, ind two in ihe other,xod then with a wager being to pull of the but*tons, which if you handly nimbly and in theend cause him to puil his two ends the two cord*will shew to be placed plainly, and the button*to have come through the cords ;

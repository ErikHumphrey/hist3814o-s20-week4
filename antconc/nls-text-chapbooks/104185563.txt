II.• Valentine conquers his Brother in the Forest ofOrleans."VTOW was Valentine grown a Issty young man,and by the King as greatly beloved as if he hadbeen his own child; commanding him to be taughtthe, use of arms, in which he soon became so expert,that few in the court dared'to encounter him; whichmade Hufray and Henry, the king’s bastard sons,'exceedingly envy him—At this juncture great com¬plaints were made against the Wild Man, from whomno Knight had escaped with his life that had encoun¬tered him; which made the King promise a thousand,merks to any one that should bring him dead or a-live; which offer n»ne dared to except; but Hufray;and Henry desired King Pepin to send Valentine,;with a view of getting rid of so powerful a rival inthe King’s favour; but his Majesty seeing their ma¬lice, was very angry; telling them, he had ratherlose the best baron in the land.However, Valentine desired leave of his Majesty-to go to the forest, resolving either to conquer theWild Man, or die in the attempt. Accordingly,having furnished himself with a good horse andarms, he set forward on his journey, and after hardtravelling, he arrived in the forest; in the evening'he tied his horse to a large spreading oak; and gotup into a tree himself, for his security, where herested for that night.Next morning he beheld the Wild Man travers¬ing the forest in search of his prey; at length hecame to the tree where Valentine’s horse stood, fromwhom hp pulled many hairs, upon which the horse"VALENTINE and ORSON. ' 5kicked him;, the Wild Man feeling the pain, was go¬ing to tear him to pieces, which Valentine seeing,made signs as if he would fight him, and accordinglyhe leaped down, and gave him-a blow; but the WildMan caught him by the arm, and threw him to theground. Then taking up Valentine’s shield, he be¬held it with amaze, In respect to thfe colours thereon'emblazoned.Valentine being much bruised, got up, and capaeto his brother in great anger; but Orson ran to a tree,and then they engaged; but both being terriblywounded, gave out by consent; after which Valen¬tine signified to Orson, that if he would yield to him,he would order matters so as die would become a ra¬tional creature. •Orson, thinking that he meant no barm, stretched 'forth his hands to him. Upon which he bound him,and then led him to Paris, where he presented himto King Pepin, who had the Wild Man baptised bythe name of Orson, from his being taken in a wood.Orson’s actions, during their stay there, very muchamused the whole court, so that at length the dukeof Acquitain sent letters, importing, that whoeverShould overcome the Green Knight, a fierce Paganchampion, should have his daughter Fazon in mar¬riage. Upon wiiich proposition, Valentine set outfor that provirice, attended by his brother Orson, bywhich means he came to the knowledge of his pa¬rents, as we shall find hereafter.CHAP. JII.Ike Fight between Orson and the Green Knight.\ FTER a long journey, Valentine and Orson ar-rived at Duke Savary’s palace in Acquitain; and6THE HISTORY OFmaking known the reasons that they came there, jwere presented to Fazon, to whom Valentine thus jaddressed himself:“ Sweet creature! King Pepin has sent me hither jwith the bravest Knight in all his realm, to fight the IGreen Knight, who, though he is dumb and naked, !is endued with stich valour, that i o Knight under Ithe sun is able to cope with him.”, During this speech, she viewed Orson narrowly, 1and he her; but sypp«r coming in, interrupted them,and they sat down to eat.Whilst they were in the midst of their feasting,the Green Knight entered, saying, Noble Duke of 1Acquitain, hast thou any more Knights to cope |with me or thy Daughter? Yes, replied the Duke, ;I have seventeen, and then shewed them to him.The Green Knight then said to them, Eat yourfill, for to-morrow will be your last.Orson, hearing what he said, was much incensed !against him, and suddenly rising from the table, ithrew the Green Knight with such force against thewall, as laid him dead for some time; which verymuch pleased the whole company. * iNext day many Knights went to fight the GreenKnight, but he overcame and slew them all, until at"last Orson being armed in Valentine’s armour, cameto the Green Knight’s pavillion, and defying him,they began the most desperate combat that ever was ,heard of, and the Green Knight made so great a'stroke at him, as to cut off the top of his helmet, |and half his shield, wounding him much.But this served only to enrage the valiant Orson,who, doming up to him on foot, took hold of him;and pulling him from his horse, got astride of him,and-was just going to'kill him, but was prevented by |VALENTINE and ORSON<7Valentine, who interceeded with Orson to spare hislife, on condition of his turning Christian, and ac¬quainted King Pepin how he was conquered.The Green Knight having promised to performall that was desired, they‘led him a prisoner to thecity of Acquitain; and the Duke received them withgreat joy, and offered the Lady Fazon to Orson; buthe would not marry her till his brother had won theGreen Knight’s.sister, Lady Clerimond; ror till theyhad talked with the enchanted Head of brass, to knowhis parents, and get the proper use of hfs tongue.Which when the Ladjy knew, she.was very sor¬rowful, because she loved Orson, and was resolvedto marry none but him, who had so nobly conqueredthe Green Knight.CHAP. IV.Valentine and Orson go in search of Lady Clcri-mond, who had the Brazen lie ad in her possession.T/"ALEN TINE and Orson having taken leave of^ the Duke of Acquitain, and his daughter Fazon,proceeded pn their journey in search, of the LadyClerimond, and at last came to a tower of burnishedbrass; w’kich, upon enquiry,, they discovered to bekept by CIerimond, sister to Feragus and the GreenKnight; and having demanded entrance, were re¬fused it by the centinal who guarded the gate; whichprovoked Valentine to that degree, that he ran againstkirn with such fury, that the centinal fell down deadimmediately.The I.ady Clerimond beheld all this dispute, andseeing them brave Knights,1 received them courte¬ously. Valentine having presented tokens from theGreen Knight, told her lib came there tor the love3 . THE HISTORY OF.of her, and to discourse with the All-knowing Head,, fconcerning their parents.After dinner, the lady Clerimond took them bythe hand, and led them 19 the chamber of varieties,where the Head was placed between four pillars ofpure jasper; when, as they entered, it made the fol- ,lowing speech to Valentine:“ Thou famous Knight of Royal extract, are calledValentine the Valiant, who of right ought to marry |the Lady Clerimond.

VI.Feragus raises a mighty Army, and lays Siege to ;the City of Acquitain.I^ERAGUS, to be revenged on them, assembled -- an army, and laid close siege to it, with a vast |army of Saracens; when Duke Savary pereceived it, jhe resolved to give them battle the very next morn¬ing, and accordingly he sallied forth with all his .forces, but venturing too far, he was taken by the ]Saracens, and carried to Feragus’s tent.Now Orson was resolved to set him free, or lose ■ *his life; so putting on the armour of a dead Saracen, ;he called Pacoiet, and went through the enemy with¬out being molested, until they arrived at the tent":where the Duke was confined; which done, theygave him a horse, and rode to the Christian army; "on their return a general shout was made by all thedrmy, Long live the Duke of Acfqritain! which soVALENTINE and ORSON. 11dismayed the Saracens, that they fled away in con¬fusion, and the Christians pursued them till the nightobliged them to give over.Soon after this victory, Valent'me, Orson, the La¬dies Bellisant, Clerimond, and Fazon, set out forConstantinople, to see the Emperor their Father, sfterthey had leave of Duke Savary and his nobles, andwere received with great joy.At length the Emperor set out from Constantino¬ple, after taking leave of his family to visit a strongcastle he had in Spain.While he was absent, Brandifer, brother to Fera-gus, invaded-the empire with a very great army, andat length besieged Constantinople, where lay Va.en-tine and Orson, the Green Knight, and all the bdies*Valentine seeing the condition they all were in,resolved to give Brandifer battle, and thereupon di¬vided his army into ten battalions, commanded byten Knights, and sallying out of the city, began thefight with the Saracens, who drew up in readinessto receive thermIn the mean time the Emperor, who was at sea,returned homeward, and in his way he met a fleetgoing to the assistance of Brnndifer, which bore uponhim with full sails; whereupon exhorting his com¬panions to behave like men, they made readv re¬ceive them, and after a t bfoedy and obstinatebattle, the Emperor got the victory^ having slainmany of the Pagans, and dispersed their chips.After this victory, the Emperor commanded hismen to pet an the arms of the vanquished, as he didhimself, thinking thereby the better to fall upon thebesiegers his enemies; but the stratagem proved mostfatal to him, as we shall hereafter find.All this while the Christian's and Valentine bravely12 • THE HISTORY OF' 'encountered Brandifer and his men, before the walls _ tof Constantinople, sometimes getting, and sometimes '!losing ground: but at length Valentine came to thestandard of Brandifer, where an Indian King ran a- |gainst him with great force, but Valentine avoidinghim, struck him with such fury as cleft him downthe middle*On the other hand, Orson and the Green Knight ^were not idle, but with their brandished swords cutthemselves a passage quite through the Pagan army,destroying all that opposed them.Soon after, news came that a mighty fleet of Sa- ^racens were entering the harbour; whereupon Va- jlentine judged it was necessary to go thither, andoppose their landing, but it proved fatal; for in thisfleet was the Emperor his father, who being clad inthe Saracen’s armour, Valentine by mistake ran himquite through the body with bis spear; which whenhe knew, he was going to kill himself, had not hisbrother & the Green Knight prevented him; but get- |ting a horse with an intent to lose his life, he rushedinto the midst of the enemy, till he came to the Gi¬ant Brandifer, who, when be saw Valentine, encoun¬tered him so fiercely, that both fell to the ground;but Valentine recovering, gave fum a stab, whichsent him to hell, to see his false prophet Mahomet.The Pagans seeing their King dead, threw downtheir arms and ran, and the Christians pursued themwith a mighty slaughter. At last the pursuit being jover, they returned to Constantinople, and Orsonacquainted the Empress of the death of his father,but concealed by whom it was done.Upon which it was concluded that Valentine andOrson should govern the empire by turns, with their !wives,,the Ladies Fazon end Clerimond, whose bro- 1VALENTINE and ORSON. 13ther, the Green Knight, was crowned King of theGreen Mountain, the people of which, were muchdelighted to have so brave a warrior for their King.CHAP. VII.Valentine dies, and Orson tut us Hermit.NOW Valentine being greatly vexed in mind forthe death of his father, whom he had killed outof a mistake, resolved to make a pilgrimage to theHoly Sepulchre; and thereupon taking leave of hiswife Clerimond, ^nd giving the government of theempire unto kis brother, he departed, to the greatsorrow of all, particularly his brother Orson, and thefair Clerimond.Valentine, after seven years absence, returned,dressed like a poor palmer, begging victuals at thegate of his own palace; and at length being sick, andabout to die, he Called for, Clerimond, and madehimself known to her, at which she was ready togive up the ghost.At last, having recommended the care of her tohis brother, and ihe Empress bis dear mother, andblessing them, he turned on one side, and breathedout his noble soul from his illustrious body, to thegreat grief of all the valiant Knights of Christendom,to whom be had been a most noble example, and agenerous reliever. But Clerimond never would es¬pouse any one, but betook herself to a single life,always lamenting the loss of her belovetj husband. .After his death, Orson governed the Empire withgreat wisdom and justice for seven years, till at lengthseeing the fragile state of human affairs, he gave thecharge of his empire, wife, and children, to the Greon14THE HISTORY OF THEKnight, and then turning hermit, he became once jmore a voluntary resident of the forest ,and woods,where, after living to a great age, this magnanimous •and invincible hero surrendered up his body unto "never sparing death, and his soul to the immortal iDeities, of whose attributes it had a true resemblance. \THE HISTORYOF THECOURTIER AMD TINKER.C H A P.

This was punctually observed. TheTinker being thus laid, slept soundly till evening;when rousing up between sleeping and waking, andbeing dry, as drunkards usually are, he began to callfor some drink; but was greatly frighted to find him¬self in such a palace, furnished with lights -and at¬tendants about him, that- bowed to him, and harmon¬ious music, accompanied with most charming voices,but none of them to be seen. Whereupon, lookingfor his old clothes and budget, he found a muff andand rich attire glistering with gold by him, whichmade him fancy himself metamorphosed from aTinker to a Prince. He asked many questions, butin vain, yet being willing to rise, the attendants ar¬rayed him in the richest attire; so then he. lookedon all sides, admiring the sudden change of fortune,and as proud as a peacock, when he spreads his tailagainst the glittering beams of the sun And beingarrayed, they had him into another room, where wasa costly banquet prepared, and placed him in a chair,under a fine canopy, fringed with gold, being at¬tended with wine in gilded cups. At first he strainedcourtesy, but being intreatedto sit down, the banquetbeing solely at his disposal1, he fell to most heartily.Then after supper they ply’d him with so much wine,as to make him dead drunk, then stripped him, andput on his old clothes; they carried him as they hadbrought Jhiim, and laid him in the same posture theyfound him, being all this time asleep;, and when heawoke, he took all. that had happened before for avision, telling it wherever he came, that he hadreally and verily dreamed he had been a prince* tell¬ing them as well as he could all that had happened,but plainly bf saw now again his fortune would raisehim no higher than to mend old kettles; yet he made16 THE HISTORY OE THEthe following song for the fraternity to sing at theirleizure:All you that jovial Tinkers are.Come listen unto me:,I dream’d a dream that was so rare,, That none to it I can compare.No Tinker such did see.I thought I was a King indeed,Attired gay and^fmejIn a stately palace I did tread,Was to a princely banquet led,And had good cheer of wine.But soon I found me in a ditch.That did no comfort lend;This shews a Tinker, though he itchTo be a Prince, or to grow rich,Must still old kettles mend.CHAP. II.The Courtier buys all the stock of a Buttcr-'tiiomangoing to Market; arid hove he served her for herCovetousness; which caused the sayings “ Thataihen a Woman scratches her Breech, Butter willbe cheap.”THIS merry Courtier riding one day a hunting,met a country-woman in a narrow lane, with a "basket on her head, which she carried as if it washeavy, and had almost tired her. He then .askedher what she had in it? She told him, butter, andthat she was carrying it three miles farther to market.O poor woman, said he, I pity thee, what wilt thousell it for?—So much, Sir, said she.—Upon whichhe gave her the money, and taking the butter, claptCOURTIER AND TINKER. 17U upon a tree, and calling his hounds, away he went,concluding what the woman would do, when he wasout of s;ght. He got within-side the hedge, and layclose till she returned, and clawing off the butterput it into her basket, and was about to be gone;when leaping over the hedge, and catching fast holdof her, he cried out, “Othouwicked covetous wretch!Art thou robbing me before my face? How muchmore then wilt thou do behind niy back? But I willbe so revenged-on thee that whenever any one seesa woman scratching of her breech, they shall cry,‘Butter will be cheap;’”, (and from thence indeed,that saying came) and so throwing her down, in spiteof all her pleading, that it was a pity good buttershould be spoiled,, her resisting and entreaties wereall in vain; for turning up her clouts, he so bedaubedher buttocks and thighs, and called his hounds tolick it off; while the poor woman cried Out lament¬ably, expecting every moment she should be devour¬ed in the bellies of these loud-mouthed voraciouscurs; but he suffered them not to hurt her, onlysending her away with a greasy pair of buttocks,which she tell to rubbing immediately, as also doubt¬ing, lest there had been some collops taken out ofthem.- C*T A P. III.The Courtier's Trick upon the Tinker, for com¬plaining that he could get no drink at his house.THE Tinker 1 have before mentioned, not know¬ing the house where he had been so nobly en¬tertained, and which he only took for a vision, andoften walking that road and crying old brass to mend,had been called in to work, and was often asked var-rsTHE HISTORY OF THEi ious questions by the servants, and as often told them |his imaginary vision; but they giving him no strongliquor, he often complained of it in the town, saying,Though some had praised Sir John’s liberality, andhow free he was of his liquor, yet for his own partihe could say no such thing, as having ever found Ihim so stingy and niggardly, that not so much as one :■sup of his fam’d March or October beer could he get. |Thisbeing babbled about, came to the Courtier’s ears,who was resolved to punish his sauciness, though in ja comical way: So one day as he was passing by, heordered him to be called in to do some work; and ^after he had done it, to come to him (as having laid |all the scheme with his servants beforehand.) Come jold fellow, said he, you look as if you were as dry ;as Vulcan. V/hat say you, if I should order ycu ^where you may have your full of good drink? Would 'not you be glad of it? Ay, Master, said he, making ;a nod and a scrape, God’s blessing on your heart for fit, and I thank you too.Upon-this, he ordered hi? butler to have him down, •and be sure not to stint him, but let him have hisfull swill: They instantly went, and the Tinker fol- ilowed them very joyfully; but they bad no sooner •gotten him down, but shutting to the door close,they ordered him to strip immediately? at the whichhe much wondered, and began io make excuses onaccount of the blackness of ins hide, which would bevery undecent and unseemly. But they pretended "it was th» way of the cellar, when a new comer wasto be made free of it, but never‘after, how oft soeverhe came. He being willing to comply, that he mighthave his skin full of good liquor, that might proveboth as meat and cloth to him; off went his leatherndoublet, breeches, shoes, stockings, and hat; as for/ : 1COURTIER. AND TINKER. 19shirt he had nohe, having pawned it to his hostessthat morning for three noggins of brand}*. Thentaking a frisk or two in a merry vein*' they surpris¬ingly whipt him up by the heels, and put him intoa full butt of strong beer, the upper head being takenup for that purpose. So he dipped over head andears like a duck that dives Yet after he had recoveredhis legs, it was but just shoulder deep, for when up¬on winding of the horn, whilst he would have beenscrambling out, down came Sir John, demandingwhat was the matter. They told him, “ The Tinkerwas not content to drink full horns at the ccck, butwould needs get in to drink all at a draught.”-^-“ Aye,” said he, “ this is a thirsty soul indeed} butsince he undertakes to drink it, he shall do it, fornone of my servants shall drink it now, he has washedhis dirty hide in it;” crying to him with an angryvoice, “ Sirrah, you rogue, drink it as you proposed,or it shall be worse for you,” and while he stoodshivering up to his neck, and was endeavouring tolay the blame upon others, the Courtier seemed im¬patient to be dallied with,'drew a broad sword thatwas two-edged, protesting his head should go off forabusing his good liquor, was there no more Tinkersin the world, and with that, making a full blow athim, as the Tinker believed, and seeing him in sucha passion, he to avoid the coming str oke, droppeddown over head and ears, staying under as long ashe could, arid peeping up, and seeing the threaten-/Ing danger, he dropt down again for six or seventimes. ’ Till fearing to carry the jest too far, he givehim a short respite, telling him, “ Now he couldnot report abroad he was so very mggardly of hisdrink, for he had or might have enough of it.”—Then bidding his servants to take him out, and order20THE HISTORY OF THEhim to depart, or drink it up, which he .thought fit.And thus he went away laughing. The Tinker, whowas at first very angry, but- being cheered up with a ,cordial dram, and so made .sensible that ail this was •but a frolicfc, and that for the future, their masterwould be his good friend if he behaved civilly Hewas pacified, .and so putting on his clothes, he beatthe road for a gang of merry fellows of his acquain¬tance, informing them, there w^as a hogshead ofMarch beer at Sir John’s, which they all might bepartakers of if they chused; they came joyfully, andhad it brought into the court-yard, itj. blackjacks.— |After they had drunk it, the Tinker told them thecause of its being given away, was because there wasa swine that had unexpectedly fallen into it; but onfurther enquiry.he told them all the circumstances,which set them a laughing till their sides were almostcrackt. Afterwards they had plenty of victuals sentthem, and the Tinker being thus made free of thecellar, was ordered to call at the house, and havevictuals and drink as often as he came that way.— ’And so they departed, spreading the fame of SirJohn in every place they came, as a bountiful bene¬factor: singing as they went, the following song:Good house-keeping, they say, is fled,Or hawks or hounds, and whores have rid her;But we say she’s not fled nor dead,Who have so plentiful beheld her.Long may he flourish in this nation,And get it praised as of old;That we by following the French fashion,May not make charity grow cold.COURTIER AND TINKER. 21CHAP. IV.A Comical Trick he made the Tinker serve an oldFarmer) who used io ride sleeping) making himthink that his Horse was the Devil.THE Tinker being better pleased with his treat¬ment, often frequented the house, making theKnight merry with his pleasant songs, &c. so thathe was much pleased with his conversation, and oftengave him money, and one day put him upon a fro-lick, seeing him an apt fellow. He had seen an oldcurmudgegn farmer, sleeping and nodding on hishorse, as he came from market, and giving theTinker directions what to do, when he should comeby, knowing his hour, and delivering him a parcelof crackers and other fire-works, he caused him to bedressed in a raw hide with horns, when the Tinker,according to order, with the Jjelp of a servant, hav¬ing stopped the farmer’s horse, while the rider wassleeping, pitched four stakes, one at each corner ofthe pannel, aud ungirting, he drew the horse fromunder, when taking off the bridle, he put his ownhead into the headstal, so then after he placed thefireworks under the pannel, he put a fuze lighted tothem, and so kept motion as the horse used to dowith the nodding farmer, who having the reins abouthis wrist, by his kicking he awaked, and seeing him¬self on a frightful beast, which he took for Beelze¬bub, he cried out, when the fire-work taking, blewup him and the pannel, and made him to fall quashto the ground, so that the Tinker made off with thestakes and pannel. The old man no sooner got up,but be fell to running, crying out, “ The Devil, theDevil,” and never durst come that way again but incompany, rather chusing to go five miles about.22THE HISTORY OF THECHAP.

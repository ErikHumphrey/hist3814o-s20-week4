A merchant asking what theywould buy, they said the truth ; which he tookamiss, and raised a hubbub ; so that they wereboth taken up and put in a cage, for public view13Christian and Faithful were brought before Mr.i Hategood, to stand their trial. Envy, Super¬stition, and Hypocrisy, were brought forward( as evidences, who did not fail to tell a partialstory ; which a partial jury confirmed ; and Faith¬ful was condemned to die at the stake.JFaithful was then brought out and suffered althe take : Thus came he to his end, but thenstood behind the multitude a chariot, and horseiinto which he was taken up and carried througlthe clouds.

So the road was full of people to see hertake her journey. So she came forth and enter¬ed the river with a beckon of farewell to thosethat follow her to the river side. The last wordsshe was heard to say, were, “ I come, Lord, tobe with thee, and bless thee.”So her children and friends returned to theirplace; for those that waited for Christiana hadcarried her out of their sight. So she went andcalled and entered in at the gate with all theceremonies of Joy that Christian had done before her.FINIS.

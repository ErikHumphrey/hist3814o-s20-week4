NEW AND IMPROVED SERIES,LIFE AND VOYAGESTHE APOSTLE PAULREV. JOHN FLEETWOOD, D.D,GLASGOW:PRINTED FOR THE BOOKSELLERS.1851.THE LIFE OFTHE APOSTLE PAUL.This great apostle of the Gentiles was a native of Tarsus,and a descendant from the ancient stock of Abraham. Heivas born about two years before the blessed Jesus, and be¬longed to the tribe of Benjamin, the youngest son of Jacob,svho thus prophesied of him: “Benjamin shall ravin as awolf: in the morning he shall devour the prey; and at nighthe shall divide the spoil;” a prophetical character whichTertullian and others will have to be accomplished in ourapostle. For, in his youth, or morning of his days, he perse¬cuted the churches, destroying the flock of the Almighty; hedevoured the prey: in his declining age, or evening of his day,he became a physician of the nations, feeding and distributingwith the greatest care and assiduity the sheep of Christ; thatgreat shepherd of Israel, he divideth the spoil.• Tarsus, the place of the apostle’s nativity, was the metro¬polis of Cilicia, and situated about three hundred miles distantfrom Jerusalem; it was exceedingly rich and populous, anda Roman municipium, or free corporation, invested with theprivileges of Rome by the two first emperors, as a reward forthe citizens’ firm adherence to the Caesars, in the rebellion ofCrassus. St. Paul was thesefore bom a Roman citizen, andhe often pleads this privilege on his trials.It was common for the inhabitants of Tarsus to send theirchildren into other cities, for learning and improvement;especially to Jerusalem, where they were so numerous, thatthey had a synagogue of their own, called the Synagogue ofthe Cilicians. To this capital Paul was also sent, andbrought up at the school of the eminent Rabbi, Gamaliel, inithe most exact knowledge of the law of Moses. Nor did heilfail to profit by the instructions of the great master; fordie so diligently conformed himself to its precepts, that,i he asserts of himself, that touching the righteousness ofthe law, he was blameless, and defied even his eh'emies toallege any thing to the contrary, even in his youth. Heijoined himself to the sect of the Pharisees, the most strictiorder of the Jewish religion; but at the same time, the4proudest, and the greatest enemies to Christ and his holy ireligion.With regard to his double capacity, of Jewish extractionand Roman freedom, he had two names, Saul and Paul, the sformer Hebrew and the latter Latin. It was common for the tdescendants of Benjamin to give the name Saul to their ichildren, ever since the time of the first king of Israel, who lwas chosen out of that tribe; and Paul was a name as com- >mon among the Romans. We must also consider his trade yof tent-making as a part of his education; it being a con¬stant practice of the Jews to bring up their children to somehonest calling, that, in case of necessity, they might providefor themselves by the labour of their own hands.Saul having obtained a thorough knowdedge of the science icultivated by the Jews, and being naturally of a very hot and'fiery temper, became a great champion of the law of Moses,and the tradition of the elders, which he considered as zealfor God. This rendered him impatient of all opposition tothe doctrine and tenets he had imbibed, and a vehement-blasphemer and persecutor of the Christians, who were ireputed the enemies of the Jewish economy. We must not,however, consider him guilty of the pride and hypocrisy of I-the Pharisees; for he declares that he had ever been careful :to act in conformity to the dictates of his conscience, by .(which he thought himself bound to do “ many things con- [trary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth.” It w'as, therefore, ithe prejudices of his education, and the natural warmth ofhis temper, that excited him to those violent persecutions ofthe Christians, for which he became so famous.The first action we find him engaged in, was the disputa¬tion he and his countrymen had with the martyr Stephen, iwith regard to the Messiah. The Christian was too hard forthem in tire dispute ; but they were too powerful for him intheir civil interests: for being enraged at his convincing .arguments, they carried him before the high priest, who by >false accusations condemned him to death. How far Saulwas concerned in this cruel action, is impossible to say; allwe know is, that he kept the raiment of them that slew him.The storm of persecution against the church being thusbegun, it increased prodigiously, and the poor Christians ofJerusalem were miserably harassed and dispersed. In thispersecution our apostle was a principal agent, searching allthe adjacent parts for the afflicted saints, beating some in tthe synagogue, inflicting other cruelties, confining some in tprisons, and procuring others to be put to death.Paul having procured from the Sanhedrim, at Jerusalem, ,5i a commission to go to Damascus to apprehend what Chris¬tians he could find in that city, and bring them bound toJerusalem, set out upon his persecuting mission. But whentravelling towards Damascus, a miraculous interposition ofprovidence stopped him in his journey. A refulgent light, farexceeding the brightness of the sun, darted upon him: atwhich both he and his companions were terribly amazedand confounded, and immediately fell prostrate on the ground.While they lay in this state, a voice was heard in the Hebrewlanguage, saying, “Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?”To which Saul replied, “ Who art thou, Lord ?” And wasimmediately answered, “ I am Jesus whom thou persecutest:it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks.”Saul was sufficiently convinced of his folly in havingacted against Jesus, and asked, “Lord, what wilt thou haveme to do ?” On which Jesus replied, “ Arise, and go into thecity, and it shall be told thee what thou must do.”The company which were with him heard the voice, butdid not see the person who spake from heaven. In all pro¬bability they were ignorant of the Hebrew language, andtherefore only heard a confused sound: for the apostle him¬self tells us that, they heard not the voice of him that spake;that is, they did not understand what was spoken.The apostle now arose from the earth, but found himselfdeprived of sight, the resplendent brightness of the visionbeing too intense for mortal eyes to behold. His companions,therefore, led him by the hand to the city of Damascus, whenhe entered the house of Judas, and remained there three dayswithout sight, nor did he either eat or drink, but spent histime in prayer to the Almighty, beseeching him to pardonthe sins of his ignorance and blinded zeal.In the meantime, Christ appeared in a vision to Ananias,a devout man, commanding him to go into a certain street,in the city of Damascus, and inquire in the house of Judasfor one Saul of Tarsus, then offering up fervent prayers tothe throne of grace. Ananias, though always ready to obeyI the divine commands, had some suspicion that the conversioni of Saul was a snare artfully laid by him against the Chris¬tians, and he therefore hesitated. But his fears were quietedi by the Saviour himself, who assured him that He had chosenPaul to preach the gospel to all nations, both Jews andGentiles. Ananias then obeyed the heavenly vision, re¬paired to the house of Judas, and, laying his hand uponSaul, addressed him in words to this effect:—“ That Jesus,”j said he, “ that appeared to thee in the way, hath sent me1 to restore thy sight, and by the infusion of his spirit, to give6thee the knowledge of those truths which thou hast blindlyand ignorantly persecuted ; but who now is willing to receivethee by baptism into his church, and make thee a member ofhis body.”This was no sooner said, than there fell from his eyes thickfilms resembling scales, and he received his sight; and afterbaptism conversed with the Christians of Damascus. Nordid he only converse with them; he also, to the great aston¬ishment of the whole church, preached the gospel to thoseChristians he came with an intention to destroy, at the sametime boldly asserting, that Jesus was the Son of God; and prov¬ing it to the Jews, with such demonstrative evidence,: thatthey were confounded, and found it impossible to answer him.The miraculous convert, at the instance of the divine com¬mand, retired into Arabia Petrtea, where he received a fullrevelation of all the mysteries of Christianity; for he him¬self declares that he conversed not with flesh and blood.Having preached in several parts of that country some time,he returned again to Damascus, applying himself, with theutmost assiduity, to the great work of the ministry, frequent¬ing the synagogues there, confuting the objections commonlymade by the descendants of Jacob against Jesus of Naza¬reth, and converting great numbers of Jews and Gentiles.He was remarkably zealous in his preaching, and blessed ■with an extraordinary method of reasoning, whereby heproved the fundamental points of Christianity beyond excep¬tion. This irritated the Jews to the highest-degree ; and atlength, they prevailed on the governor of Damascus to havehim put to death.In this distress his Christian friends tried evety methodthat offered to procure his escape, and as the gates of thecity were strictly guarded, they let him down from the windowof a house in a basket over the wall.Having thus escaped from his malicious persecutors, herepaired to Jerusalem, and on his arrival addressed himselfto the church. But they knowing well the temper and prin¬ciples of the persecutor, shunned his company, till Barnabasbrought him to Peter, who was not yet cast into prison, andto James, bishop of Jerusalem, informing them of hismiraculous conversion, and that he had preached the gospelwith boldness in the synagogues of Damascus ; upon which ithey gladly received him, and entertained him fifteen days.During this interval, he was remarkably assiduous in Ipreaching the gospel, and confuting the Hellenist Jews with ithe greatest courage and resolution. But being warned by 'God in a vision, that his testimony would not be received at7:> Jerusalem, lie thought proper to depart, and preach the gos-u pel to the Gentiles. Accordingly, being conducted by his0 brethren toCesarea Philippi, he set sail for Tarsus, his nativelicity; from whence he was soon after brought by Barnabas to/Antioch, to assist in propagating Christianity in that city. Inithis employment he spent one whole year, and had the satisfac-lition of seeing the gospel flourish in a very remarkable manner.D It was in this city that the disciples first acquired the name)of Christians, before which they were styled Nazarenes; butthis appellation soon prevailed all over the world; and theflatter was in a few ages almost entirely forgotten.About this time a terrible famine, foretold by Agabus, kap-i pened in several parts of the Roman empire, particularlyJudea, which induced the Christians at Antioch to compas¬sionate the miseries of their brethren at Jerusalem. Theyaccordingly raised considerable contributions for their relief,which they sent to the capital of Judea by the hands of Bar¬nabas and Saul, who immediately after executing their com¬mission, returned to Antioch. But while they were perform¬ing the public exercises of religion, it was revealed to themby the Holy Ghost, that they should “ set apart Barnabasand Saul” to preach the gospel in other places; which wasaccordingly done, and they were immediately deputed forthat service by prayer, fasting, and imposition of hands.The first place they visited was Saleucig, where they didnot continue long, but sailed for Cyprus; and at Salamis,a great city in that island, they preached in the synagogue ofthe Jews. Trom hence they removed to Paphos, the resi¬dence of Sergius Panlus, the pro-consul of the island, a manof great wisdom and prudence, but miserably seduced by thewicked artifices of Bar Jesus, a Jewish impostor, who styledhimself Elymas, or the magician, vehemently opposed theapostles, and kept the pro-consul from embracing the faith.The pro-consul, however, called for the apostles, who, afterseverely checking Elymas for his malicious opposition to thetruth, told him the divine vengeance was now ready to seizeupon him, and immediately he was deprived of his sight.This miracle convinced the pro-consul of the truth of the doc¬trines taught by the apostles, and made him a convert to thefaith.St. Paul, after this remarkable success in Cyprus, repairedto Phrygia in Pamphylia, and taking another with him, in theroom of Mark, who was gone to Jerusalem, travelled toAntioch.Soon after their arrival, they entered the synagogue of theJews, on the Sabbath-day, and after the reading of the law,8Paul being invited by the rulers of the synagogue, deliveredhimself in the following manner: “ Hearken all ye descen¬dants of Jacob, and ye that fear the Almighty, to the words ofmy mouth. The God of Israel made choice of our fathers,and loved them, when they had no city of their own to dwellin, but were strangers and slaves in Egypt, bringing them fromthence with a mighty hand, and a stretched out arm ; fedthem in the wilderness forty years, and would not suffer hisanger to rise against them, though they often provoked himin the desert. On their arrival in the land he promised theirfathers, he destroyed the nations that inhabited it, and placedthem in that faithful country, dividing it to them by lot.“ When they were settled in the land, he gave them judgesduring four hundred and fifty years, till Samuel the prophet.But on their desiring a king, he placed over them Saul, theson of Kish, a Benjamite, who reigned about forty years.After his death, he placed David on the throne of Israel,giving him this testimony, ‘I have found David, the son ofJesse, a man after mine own heart, which shall fulfil all mywill.’ And according to his promise the Almighty hathraised up to the sons of David, a Saviour, Jesus, which isChrist the Lord: the baptism of repentance having beenpreached before his coming by John. And as his forerunnerexecuted his office, he asked his followers, Whom think ye thatI am? You must not mistake me for the Messiah; he willsoon follow me: but I am not worthy to perform the meanestoffice for him.“ To you, therefore, ye descendants of Abraham, and allothers who fear the Almighty, is this word of salvation sent.For the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and rulers of Israel, beingignorant of him, and the voices of the prophets, though readevery Sabbath in the synagogues, fulfilled their predictions bycondemning the immaculate Son of the Most High. Theyfound, indeed, no fault with him, though they earnestlydesired Pilate that he might be slain.“ When every thing that had been written by the prophetsconcerning him was fulfilled, they took him from the tree,and deposited his body in the chambers of the grave. Butdeath had no power to detain him: his Almighty Fatherraised him from the habitations of the dead. After which,he was seen during many days by his disciples, who attendedhim from Galilee, and were the witnesses chosen by Omnipo¬tence, of these great and miraculous works. And we nowdeclare unto you glad tidings, namely, that the promise madeby the Almighty to our forefathers, he hath performed to usthe children, by raising Jesus from the dead. The prophet0Cl David also said, ‘ Thou art my Son, this day I have begottenI; thee.’ He also foretold, that he should return from theN chambers of the dust, and no more be subject to corruption:1 I will give him, said he, the sure mercies of David. AndI again, ‘ Thou shalt not suffer thine Holy One to see corrup¬tion.’ Now this prophecy must relate to the Messiah; forDavid himself, after he had swayed the sceptre of Israel acertain time, fell asleep, was deposited in the chambers ofthe grave, and his flesh saw corruption : but the great Sonof David, whom the Almighty raised from the dead, neversaw corruption.“ Be it therefore known unto you, men and brethren, thatthrough this Saviour is preached unto you the forgiveness ofsins. It is by his merits we are justified from all things,which were impossible by the law of Moses. Be careful,therefore, lest what was foretold by the prophets come uponyou. ‘ Behold, ye despisers, and wonder and perish: for Iwork a work in your day, a work which you shall in nowisebelieve, though a man declare it unto you.’ ”This spirited address of the apostle carried with it itsown weight, and obtained, from the converted Jews, a re¬quest that it should again be delivered the ensuing Sabbath ;when almost the whole city flocked to hear the apostle; atwhich the Jews were filled with envy, and contradicted Paul,uttering many blasphemous expressions against the name ofJesus of Nazareth. But their opposition could not daunt theapostles, who boldly declared, that our blessed Saviour hadcharged them to preach the gospel first to the Jews, but asthey so obstinately rejected it, they were now to addressthemselves to the Gentiles; who hearing this, rejoiced ex¬ceedingly, magnifying the words of the Almighty, and manyof them embraced the doctrines of the gospel.Paul and Barnabas being driven from Antioch, retreatedto Iconium, the metropolis of Lycania, a province of LesserAsia, where they made many converts, both Jews and prose¬lytes. But though they had gained a considerable part of thecity to the faith, yet many continued in their infidelity: the oldleaven of Jewish malice began again to ferment, and theunbelieving Jews, having stirred up many Gentiles againstthe apostles, at last prevailed on the multitude to stonethem. But the apostles, having timely notice of theirdesign, fled from the city, and travelled to Lystra, where theypreached the gospel to the inhabitants, and those who dweltin the adjacent country.Among the converts at Lystra was a man who had beenI lame from his mother’s womb, and never had walked. Paul,10perceiving that he had faith to be saved, cried in an audiblevoice to the man, Stand vpright on thy feet. The-words wereno sooner pronounced, than his strength was at once restored,and he leaped up and walked.The people who beheld this miracle well knew that itwas not wrought by any human power; but having beeninitiated in the superstitious customs of the heathens, theycried out. The Gods are come down to us in the likeness of men.Accordingly they called Barnabas Jupiter, because of hisvenerable gravity, and Paul Mercury, from his eloquence.Nor was it long before the whole city resounded with accla¬mations ; so that almost all the inhabitants gathered them¬selves together, and, preceded by the priests of Jupiter, andoxen dressed in garlands, they came to the house where theapostles were, intending to do sacrifice to them.But as soon as Barnabas and Paul understood their inten¬tions, they were greatly affected at this superstitious design ; ■and rending their clothes to express their grief and abhor¬rence of the action, ran to them, crying out, “ Ye men ofLystra, ye are mistaken in the object of your worship; forthough we have done many miracles in the name, and by thepower of Christ, yet we are no more than men, and subjectto the same passions with yourselves, and preach unto youthe glad tidings of salvation, that ye may forsake the vanities "of this world, and turn to the living God, who created theheavens and the earth, the sea, and all the creatures theycontain.” This argument of the apostle’s had the desiredeffect; and the people were at last, though with difficulty,persuaded to lay aside their intended idolatrous sacrifice.But the malice of the Jews still pursued the apostles; forsome of these bigoted Israelites coming from Antioch andIconium, exasperated and stirred up the multitude; so thatthose very persons who could hardly be restrained from offer¬ing sacrifice to them, now used them like slaves, stoning themin so cruel a manner, that Paul was thought to be dead, andas such they dragged him out of the city; but while theChristians of Lystra were attending on his body, probably inorder to carry him to the grave, he arose and returned withthem into the city; and the next day departed with Barnabasto Derbe, where they preached the gospel, and converted many.They soon, however, returned to Lystra, Iconium, Antioch,and Pisidia, confirming the Christians of those places in thefaith, earnestly persuading them to persevere, and not to bodiscouraged with those troubles and persecutions, whichwould attend the profession of the gospel. ' And that theaffairs of the church might be conducted with more regularity,11they ordained elders and pastors to teach, and to watch overthem; and then left them to the protection of the Almighty,to whose care they recommended them by prayer and fasting.After leaving Antioch they passed through Pisidia, andcame toPamphylia: and after preaching the gospel at Perga,they went down to Attalia. Having thus finished the circuitof their ministry, they returned back to Antioch, in Syria,from whence they at first departed. Here they summonedthe church, and gave them an account of their ministry, thesuccess it had met in different parts, and how great a doorhad thus been opened for the conversion of the Gentile world.While St. Paul continued at Antioch, that famous con¬troversy, with regard to the observation of the Jewish cere¬monies in the Christian dispensation, was set on foot bycertain Jewish converts to the great disturbance of the wholechurch: and it was determined to send Paul and Barnabasto consult with the apostles and church at Jerusalem, thatthis affair might be settled on the most solid foundation.On their arrival at Jerusalem, they first addressed themselvesto Peter, James, and John, the pillars of that church, bywhom they were kindly entertained, and admitted to theright hand of fellowship: and perceiving by the accountgiven them by St. Paul, that the gospel of the uncircum¬cision was committed to him, as that of the circumcision wasto Peter, they agreed that Peter should preach to the Jews,and Paul to the Gentiles. This being determined, a councilwas summoned, wherein Peter declared his opinion, and Pauland Barnabas acquainted them with the great things God,by their ministry, had done among the Gentiles: a plainevidence that they were accepted by the Almighty, thoughuncircumcised, as well as the Jews with all their legal rightsand privileges : accordingly it was unanimously determined,that the Gentiles were not under the obligation of the lawof Moses, and therefore that some persons of their ownchurch should be joined with Paul and Barnabas, to carrythe decrees of the council at Antioch, for their farther satis¬faction in this matter.The controversy concerning the observation of Jewishceremonies in the Christian church being decided in favourof St. Paul, he and his companions returned back toAntioch; and soon after Peter himself came down. Onreading the decretal epistle in the Church, the converts con¬versed freely and inoffensively with the Gentiles till some ofthe Jews coming thither from Jerusalem, Peter withdrewhis conversation, as it had been a thing unwarrantable andunlawful. By such a strange method of proceeding the minds12of many were dissatisfied, and their consciences very uneasy.'St. Paul with the greatest concern observed it, and publiclyrebuked Peter, with that sharpness and severity his unwar¬rantable practice deserved.Soon after this, Paul and Barnabas resolved to visit the.churches they had planted among the Gentiles, and Barnabaswas desirous of taking with them his cousin Mark; but thisPaul strenuously opposed, as he had left them in their formerjourney. This trifling dispute arose to such-a height, thatthose two great apostles and fellow-labourers in the gospelparted; Barnabas taking Mark with him, repaired to Cyprus,his native country, and Paul having made choice of Silas,and recommended the success of his undertaking to the careof divine providence, set forward on his intended journey.They first visited the churches of Syria and Cilicia, andthen sailed to Crete, where Paul preached the gospel, andconstituted Titus to be the first bishop and Pastor in theisland. From hence Paul and Silas returned back intoCilicia, and came to Lystra, where they found Timothy,whose father was a Greek, but his mother a Jewish convert,and by her he had been brought up under all the advantagesof a pious and religious education, especially with regard tothe Holy Scriptures, which he had studied with the greatestassiduity and success. This person St. Paul designed for thecompanion of his travels, and a special instrument in the minis¬try of the gospel. But knowing that his being uncircumcisedwould prove a stumbling-block to the Jews, he caused himto be circumcised, being willing in lawful and indifferentmatters to conform himself to the tempers and apprehensionsof men, in order to save their souls.Every tiling being ready for their journey, St. Paul and hiscompanions departed from Lystra, passing through Phrygiaand Galatia, where the apostle was entertained with thegreatest kindness and veneration, the people looking upon himas an angel sent from heaven; and being by revelation for¬bidden to go into Asia, he was commanded by a secondvision to repair to Macedonia, to preach the gospel. Accord¬ingly, he prepared to pass from Asia into Europe.Here Luke joined them, and became ever after the insepar¬able companion of St. Paul, who being desirous of finding thespeediest passage into Macedonia, took ship with Silas, Luke,and Timothy, and came to Samothracia, an island in theyEgean Sea, not far from Thrace; and the next day went toNeapolis, a port of Macedonia. Leaving Neapolis, theyrepaired to Philippi, the metropolis of that part of Mace¬donia, and a Roman colony, where they stayed some days.13la this city Paul preached ia an oratory of the Jews, whichwas much frequented by devout women, many of whom be¬came converts. As they were repairing to this place of wor¬ship, a damsel, who possessed a spirit of divination, by whomI her masters acquired great advantage, followed Paul and: his companions, crying out, “ These men are the servants ofi the Most High God, which show unto us the way of salva¬tion.” This she continued to do for several days together;but at length the apostle, in the name of Christ, commandedthe spirit to come out of her; and that very instant thewoman was relieved.This miraculous cure proving a great loss to her masters,who acquired large gains from her soothsaying, they werefilled with malice against the apostles ; and, by their instiga¬tion, the multitude arose, and seized upon Paul and his com¬panions, hurried them before the magistrates and governors;accusing them of introducing many innovations which wereprejudicial to the state.The magistrates being concerned for the tranquillity of thoplace, were very forward to punish the offenders, againsti whom great numbers of the multitude testified; and there-i fore commanded the officers to strip them, and scourge themseverely, as seditious persons.This was accordingly executed; after which the apostles\{ were committed to close custody, and their feet made fast in!l the stocks. But at midnight they prayed and sung praises soI loud, that they were heard in every part of the prison. Nor1 were their prayers offered to the throne of grace in vain : ani earthquake shook the foundations of the prison, opened thel doors, loosed the chains, and set the prisoners at liberty.This convulsion of nature roused the gaoler from his sleep;i and concluding from what he saw, that all the prisoners werei escaped, he was going to put a period to his life; but Pauli observing him, hastily cried out, Do thyself no harm, for wei are all here. The keeper was now as greatly surprised at thei goodness of the apostles, as he was before terrified at the' thoughts of their escape: and calling for a light, he came im-r mediately into the presence of the apostles, fell down at theirIj feet, took them from the dungeon, brought them to his owni house, washed their stripes, and begged them to instruct himin the knowledge of that God who was so mighty to save.St. Paul readily granted his request, and replied, That, ifhe believed in Jesus Christ, he might be saved, with his wholehouse: accordingly the gaoler and his family were, after acompetent instruction, baptized, and received as members ofthe church of Christ.14As soon as it was day, the magistrates either hearing whathad happened, or reflecting on what they had done as tooharsh and unjustifiable, sent their serjeant to the gaoler withorders to discharge the apostles. The gaoler joyfully de¬livered the message, and bid them depart in peace; but Paul,that he might make the magistrates sensible what injury theyhad done them, and how unjustly they had punished themwithout examination or trial, sent them word, that, as theythought proper to scourge and imprison Romans, contrary tothe laws of the empire, he expected they should come them¬selves, and make them some satisfaction.The magistrates were terrified at this message; well know¬ing how dangerous it was to provoke the formidable power ofthe Romans, \who never suffered any freeman to be beatenuncondemned; they came therefore to the prison, and verysubmissively entreated the apostles to depart without any far¬ther disturbance.Leaving Philippi, where Paul and his companions hadlaid the foundation of a very eminent church, they proceededto Thessalonica, the metropolis of Macedonia. In this citytheir doctrine was strenuously opposed by the Jews, whowould not allow Jesus to be the Messiah, because of hisignominious death.During the stay of the apostles at Thessalonica, they lodgedin the house of a certain Christian named Jason, who enter¬tained them very courteously. But the Jews gathered to¬gether a great number of lewd and wicked wretches, who besetthe house of Jason, intending to take Paul, and deliver himup to an incensed multitude. But in this they were disap¬pointed, Paul and Silas being removed from thence by theChristians, and concealed in some other part of the city.Their fury, however, being exasperated at losing their prey,they seized on Jason, with some others of the brethren, andcarried them before the magistrates of the city, accusing themof setting up Jesus as a king, in derogation of the emperor’sdignity and authority. Jason and his companions were setat liberty only after they had given security for their appear¬ance.As soon as the tumult was over, the Thessalonians, whohad been converted by them, sent away Paul and Silas bynight to Bertca, a city about fifty miles south of Thessalonica,but out of the power of their enemies. Here also Paul’sgreat love for his countrymen the Jews, and his earnest de¬sire of their salvation, excited him to preach to them in par¬ticular; accordingly, he entered into their synagogue, andexplained the gospel unto them, proving out of the Scripturesof the Old Testament, the truth of the doctrines he advanced.These Jews were of a more ingenuous and candid temper thani those of Thessalonica. They heard him, with great ntten-Ition, expound and apply the Scriptures; they searched dili¬gently, whether his proofs were proper and pertinent, andconsonant to the sense of the texts he referred to: and havingfound every thing to be agreeable to what Tanl had advanced,many of them believed; and several Gentiles followed theirexample, became obedient to the faith, among whom wereseveral women of quality.Paul leaving Berrea, proceeded to Athens, where Silas andTimotheus were to repair to him as soon as possible.While Paul continued at Athens, expecting the arrival ofI Silas and Timothy, he walked up and down the city, which hefound miserably overrun with superstition and idolatry. Theinhabitants were remarkably religious and devout; they had£i great number of false gods, whom they adored : and so verycareful were they, that no deity should want due honour forthem, that they had an altar inscribed, to the unknownGod. A great variety of reasons are given for this inscrip¬tion : some affirm, that it was the name which the Pagansgenerally gave to the god of the Jews; but others think thatincluded all the gods of Asia, Europe, and Africa.These superstitious practices grieved the spirit of theapostle; accordingly, he exerted all his strength for their con¬version ; he disputed on the Sabbath-days in the synagogues ofthe Jews; and at other times took all opportunities ofpreaching to the Athenians the coming of the Messiah, tosave the world.This doctrine was equally new and strange to the Athenians;and though they did not persecute him as the Jews did, yet hispreaching Jesus was considered, by the Epicurean and Stoicphilosophers, as a fabulous legend; and by the more soberpart as a discovery of some new gods, which they had not yetplaced in their temples : and though they were not unwillingto receive any new deities, yet as the Areopagus, the supremecourt of the city, was to judge of all gods, to whom publicworship might be allowed, they brought him before thosejudges, to give account of his doctrine.Paul being placed before the judges of this high assembly,readily gave them an account of his doctrine, in a grave andeloquent speech; wherein he did not tell them they werehorrible and gross idolaters, lest he should offend them, andthereby prevent them from listening to his reason: but, hav¬ing commended them for their religious dispositions, he tookoccasion, from the altar inscribed to the unknown, God, to make16a proper defence of his doctrine. “I endeavour,” said he, (“only to explain that altar to you, and manifest the nature ofthat God whom you ignorantly worship. The true God is hethat made the world, and all things therein; and who beingLord of all, dwells not in temples made with hands, nor is tobe worshipped in lifeless idols. As he is the creator of allthings, he cannot be confined to the workmanship of man,whether temples or statues ; nor stand in need of sacrifices,since he is the fountain of life to all things. He made from onecommon original the whole race of mankind, and hath wiselydetermined their dependence on him, that they might be oblig¬ed to seek after him and serve him. A truth perceivable in thedarkest state of ignorance, and acknowledged by one of yourown poets. If this be the nature of God, it is surely thehighest absurdity to represent him by an image of similitude. :The divine patience hath been too much exercised alreadywith such gross abuses in religion, but now expects a thoroughreformation, having sent his Son Jesus Christ to make him :known to the world, and at the same time to inform themthat he hath appointed a day of general judgment, when thereligion of mankind shall be tried by the test of the gospel,before his only-begotten Son, who is appointed sole judge ofthe quick and dead, and whose commission to that high office :hath been ratified by the Almighty, in raising him from thedead.”On his mentioning the resurrection, some philosophers 'mocked and derided him ; others, more modest, but not satis¬fied with the proofs he had given, gravely answered, “Wewould hear thee again of this matter.” After which Pauldeparted from the court; but not without some success, for afew of his auditors believed and attended his instructions.During St. Paul's stay at Athens, Timothy came to himout of Macedonia; and brought an account that the Chris- .tians at Thessalonica were under persecution from their fel¬low citizens ever since his departure: at which St. Paul wasgreatly concerned, and at first inclined to visit them in person,to confirm them in the faith; but being hindered by the ene¬mies of the gospel, he sent Timothy to comfort them.On Timothy’s departure, St. Paul left Athens, and travelledto Corinth, a very populous place, and famous for its trade.Here he found Aquila and Priscilla his wife, lately come fromItaly, having been banished from Rome, by the decree ofClaudius. And they being of the same trade he himself hadlearned in his youth, he wrought with them, that he mightnot be burdensome to the new converts.Here the apostle was joined by Silas and Timothy, who17[assisted him in preaching to both Jews and Gentiles. Amongthe converts to the faith in this city were Crispus, the chiefruler of the synagogue, and Gains, and Stephanus, who, withtheir families, were baptized, and admitted members of theChristian church.But lest the behaviour of unbelievers should discouragei Paul, our dear Redeemer appeared to him in a vision, and toldhim, that notwithstanding the bad success he had hithertomet with, there was a large harvest to be gathered in thatplace; that he should not be afraid of his enemies, but preachthe gospel boldly and securely, for that he himself would pro¬tect and preserve him.About this time he seems to have written his first epistle totheThessalonians, Silas andTimothybeinglately returned fromthence, and delivered the message for which he had sent themthither. The principal design of this epistle is to confirmthem in the belief of the Christian religion, and excite themto persevere in it, notwithstanding all the malice of theirenemies, and the persecutions they must expect to suffer, andto instruct them in the duties of a religions life.During the apostle’s stay at Corinth, he wrote his secondj epistle to the Thessalonians, to supply his absence. In thisepistle he again endeavours to confirm their minds in thetruth of the gospel, and prevent their being shaken with thosetroubles, which the wicked and unbelieving Jews would becontinually raising against them. And because some pas¬sages in his former epistle relating to the destruction of theJews, had been misunderstood, as if the day of the Lord wasnear at hand, he rectifies these mistakes, and shows the signsthat must precede our Lord’s coming to judgment.St. Paul on leaving the church at Corinth, took ship atCenchrea, the port of Corinth, for Syria, taking with himAquila and Priscilla, and on his arrival at Ephesus, hepreached in the synagogue of the Jews, promising to returnto them, after keeping the passover at Jerusalem. Accord¬ingly he again took ship, and landed at Csesarea, and fromthence travelled to Jerusalem, where he kept the feast, visit¬ed the church, and then repaired to Antioch. Here he stayedsome time, and then traversed the countries of Galatia andPhrygia, confirming the new converted Christians, till he cameto Ephesus.During the time he spent in this large circuit, providencetook care of the churches of Ephesus and Corinth, by meansof one Apollos, an eloquent Jew of Alexandria, and well ac¬quainted with the law and writings of the prophets. Thisman coming to Ephesus, though he was only instructed in the18rudiments of Christianity, and John’s baptism, yet he taughtwith, great courage, and a most powerful zeal. After beingfully instructed in the faith by Aquila and Priscilla, he passedover into Achaia, being furnished with recommendatory let¬ters by the churches of Ephesus and Corinth. He was of thegreatest service in Achaia, in watering what Paul had plant¬ed, confirming the disciples, and convincing the Jews, thatJesus was the true Messiah, promised in the Scriptures.While Apollos was thus employed, St. Paul returned toEphesus, where he fixed his abode for three years, bringingwith him Gains of Derbe, Aristarchus, a native of Thessa-lonica, Timotheus and Erastus of Corinth, and Titus. Thefirst thing he did after his arrival was to examine certain dis¬ciples, Whether they had received the Holy Ghost since they be¬lieved1! To which they answered, “That the doctrine theyhad received promised nothing of that nature, nor had theyever heard that such an extraordinary spirit had of late beenbestowed upon the church.”This answer surprised the apostle, who asked them, in whatname they had been baptized? since, in the Christian form,the name of the Holy Ghost was always expressed. Theyreplied, that they had only received John’s baptism; uponwhich the apostle informed them, that though John’s baptismcommanded nothing but repentance, yet it tacitly implied thewhole doctrine of Christ aud the Holy Ghost. When theyheard this, they were baptized according to the form pre¬scribed by Christ himself, that is, in the name of the Father,of the Son, aud of the Holy Ghost; and after the apostle hadprayed and laid his hands upon them, they received the gift oftongues, and other miraculous powers.After this, he continued for three months to dispute withthe Jews, endeavouring to convince them of the truth of theChristian religion. But on account of their obstinacy andinfidelity, he departed from their synagogue, and went tothe school of one Tyrannus, where he preached the gospel fortwo whole years. During this time, the Almighty was pleasedto testify the doctrine which St. Paul delivered by manymiracles, several of which were of a peculiar nature ; for henot only healed those that came to him, but if napkins weresimply touched by him, and applied to the sick, their diseasesinstantly vanished, and evil spirits departed out of those thatwere possessed by them.About this time theapostlewrote his epistleto the Galatians,in which he reproves them with some necessary severity forsuffering themselves to be so easily seduced by the artificesof several impostors, who had found admittance into the19jchurch since his departure. He refutes certain Judaical(opinions that had corrupted them; yindicates the immediate(receiving his commission from Christ; and, in the conclusion,(instructs them in the rules and duties of a holy life.I During St. Paul’s stay at Ephesus, an event occurred which((was attended with great danger. In this city was the cele-Ibrated temple of Diana, a structure so magnificent for beauty,riches, and magnitude, that it was reckoned one of the sevenwonders of the world. The image of the goddess being heldin great veneration, the making of silver shrines or figures ofthe temple, proved the source of considerable business to thea silversmiths of the city, of whom one Demetrius was chief.This man having called all the artists together, representedj to them that the ruin of their gainful employment was inevi-I table, if Paul was suffered to bring their temple and goddess| into contempt, by persuading the people that they were no1 gods which were made with hands. This speech fired then assembly with such zeal, that they cried out with one voice,N Great is Diana of the Ephesians! The tumult quickly spread[] throughout the city, and as the multitude could not discoverR Paul, they seized two Macedonians of his company, and aj] converted Jew, with a design to throw them to the wild1 beasts. In the midst ot this confusion, the town clerk of. Ephesus, who endeavoured to quell the disturbance, ad-i dressed the crowd, telling them that the courts were open if} Demetrius and his fraternity had any accusation against Pauland his companions, and that there was no necessity what-j ever for their publishing to the world at that time, that theEphesians paid devotion to the great goddess Diana. Themultitude being by this discourse convinced of the impro¬priety of their conduct, repaired peaceably to their respectivehabitations, and Paul’s friends were set at liberty.About this time Paul was informed of some disturbancesin the church at Corinth, hatched and fomented by a com¬pany of false teachers crept in among them, who endeavouredto draw them into parties and factions, by persuading onecompany to be for Peter, another for Paul, and a third forApollos. To cure these dissensions, St. Paul wrote his firstepistle to the Corinthians, wherein he reproves them for theirschisms and parties, conjures them to peace and unity,corrects those gross corruptions that had been introducedamong them, and particularly resolves those controversieswherein they had requested his advice and counsel. Soonafter, Apollos determining to go to Crete, together withZanos, St. Paul sent by them his Epistle to Titus, whom hehad made bishop of that island, and had left there for pro-20pagating the gospel. In this Epistle he instructs him fullyin the execution of his office, both with regard to himselfand others.Soon after the tumult at Ephesus, Paul called the Chris¬tians together, and took leave of them. He had spent almostthree years at Ephesus, and founded a considerable church,of which he had ordained Timothy, the first bishop. He firsttravelled about two hundred miles northward, to Troas, beforehe took ship, expecting to meet Titus there. But missinghim, he proceeded on his voyage to Macedonia.On his arrival there, he preached the gospel in severalplaces, even as far as Illyricum, now called Sclavonia. Dur¬ing this journey he met with many troubles and dangers,without were fightings, and icithin fears; but God revived his ;spirits by the arrival of Titus, who gave him a pleasing ac¬count of the good effect his epistle had produced at Corinth.Titus came thither with contributions from the church atCorinth, and from the example of those liberal Christians,St. Paul stirred up the Macedonians to imitate their charity,intending to assist the poor Christians at Jerusalem.During the stay of Titus in Macedonia, Paul wrote hissecond Epistle to the Corinthians, and sent it to them byTitus and Luke. About this time also he wrote his firstepistle to Timothy, wherein he gives him directions how toconduct himself in the discharge of that great office andauthority in the church committed to his care.During his stay in Greece, he went to Corinth, where hewrote his famous epistle to the Romans, in which his prin¬cipal intention is fully to state and determine the great con¬troversy between the Jews and Gentiles, with regard to theobligations of the rites and ceremonies of the Jewish law, andthose principal and material points of doctrine dependingupon it, namely, Christian liberty, the use of indifferentthings, and the like.St. Paul being now determined to return into Syria, inorder to convey tbe contributions to tbe brethren at Jerusa¬lem, set out on his journey ; but being informed that theJews had formed a design of killing and robbing him bythe way, he returned back into Macedonia, and came toPhilippi, from thence he went to Troas, where he stayedseven days. Here he preached to them on the Lord’s day,and contimred his discourse till midnight, being himself todepart in the morning. The length of his discourse, andtime of the night, caused some of his audience to be over¬taken with sleep, and among them a young man namedEutychus, who fell from the third story, and was taken up21i dead ; but the apostle, by his prayers to the throne of grace,presently restored him to life and health.The night being thus spent in holy exercises, St. Paultook his leave of the brethren in the morning, travelling onfoot to Assos, a seaport town, whither he had before sent his1 companions by sea. From thence they sailed to Mitylene, acity in the isle of Lesbos, and afterwards came to Miletus, notputting in at Ephesus, because the apostle was resolved, ifpossible, to be at Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost.On his arrival at Miletus, he sent to Ephesus, to summonthe elders of the church ; and reminded them how faithfullyand affectionately he had discharged the offices of his ministry,and how incessantly he had laboured for the good of thesouls of men: urging both the Jews and Gentiles to repen¬tance, and reformation of life, and perseverance in the faithof Christ: that he was now going up to Jerusalem, where hewas ignorant of what might befall him, except what had beenforetold him by those endued with the prophetical gifts of theHoly Ghost; namely, that afflictions and imprisonment wouldattend him. But that this gave him no concern, being willingto lay down his life whenever the gospel required it, and fullydetermined to serve faithfully his great Lord and Master.Paul, with his companion, now departed from Miletus,and arrived at Coos, from whence they sailed the next day toRhodes, a large island in the yEgean sea. Leaving this place,they came to Patara, the metropolis of Lycia, where theywent on board another vessel bound for Tyre in Phenicia.On his arrival, he visited the brethren there, and continuedwith them a week, and was advised by some of them, whohad the gift of prophecy, not to go up to Jerusalem. Butthe apostle would by no means abandon his design, or refuseto suffer any thing, provided he might spread the gospel ofhis Saviour. Finding all persuasions were in vain, theyjointly accompanied him to the shore, where he kneeleddown, and prayed with them; and after embracing him withthe utmost affection, he went on board, and came to Ptole-mais, and the next day to Cesarea.During their stay at this place, Agabus, a Christian pro¬phet, came thither from Judea, who, taking Paul’s girdle,bound his own hands and feet with it, signifying, by this sym¬bol, that the Jews would bind Paul in that manner, anddeliver him over to the Gentiles. Whereupon both his owncompanions and the Christians of Cesarea earnestly besoughthim that he would not go up to Jerusalem. But the apostleasked them, if they intended by these passionate dissuasivesto add more affliction to his sorrow ? “ For I am ready22(continued he,) not only to he bound, but also to die, atJerusalem, for the name of the Lord Jesus.” And all thingsbeing ready, Paul and his companions set forward on theirjourney.On his arrival at Jerusalem, he found the malice of hisenemies unabated, and many of his friends alienated from himon account of his lax notions of the Mosaic ritual. He there¬fore, with the advice of the Apostle James, joined himselfwith four persons who were to take the Nazarite vows, thathe might perform the rites and ceremonies with them, andprove that he conformed to the law. This, however, didnot diminish the hatred of the Jews. On his appearance inthe temple, they seized, and would have put him to death,but for Lysias, the commander of the Homan cohort in thecitadel, who brought soldiers to his rescue. Thus protected,he addressed the mob, giving an account of his life and con¬version, and his appointment to preach the gospel to theGentiles, all which they heard attentively, till he stated thatunder the gospel the Gentiles were on a par with the Jews,when all their feelings of national bigotry burst forth in atempest of execration and fury.Lysias now had him brought within the castle to boscourged, that he might be made to confess his crime; butPaul asserted his privileges as a Roman citizen, whom it wasunlawful to bind or scourge. Next day before the Sanhe¬drim he defended his conduct, and avowed his belief in abodily resurrection, which occasioned such a fierce contro¬versy between the Pharisees who favoured this doctrine, andthe Sadducees who opposed it, that Lysias, fearing he mightbe torn to pieces among them, gave orders to remove himinto the fort. Above forty of the Jews formed a conspiracyto assassinate him, but his nephew having heard of it, reportedit both to Paul and Lysias, when the latter sent the apostleunder escort during the night to Felix, the procurator ofthe province, at Cesarca. Here Paul and his accusers wereheard before Felix, but though his defence was unanswer¬able, the procurator fearing to give the Jews offence, cameto no decision, and Paul was retained in bonds. Sometime after he was again brought before Felix and his wifeDrusilla, on which occasion he discoursed so strongly onmorality, in which his audience were notoriously deficient,that Felix trembled, and hastily sent him from his presence.Shortly after this, Felix was succeeded by Porcius Festus,before whom the Jews again brought their charges againstPaul, and who was so inclined to favour the Jews, that theapostle felt himself constrained to appeal to Caesar. Td23gratify King Agrippa and liis wife Bernice, who bad come toCesarea to visit I'estas, Paul was again brought before thegovernor. He now recapitulated the leading points in hishistory, and stated his views and designs in such a manner,as to make a considerable impression on the mind of KingAgrippa, and draw from him the well-known sentence—“ Almost thou persuadest me to be a Christian.”Paul having appealed to Caesar, it was necessary that heshould go to Rome, and thither accordingly Festus had himconveyed. His voyage was a long and disastrous one. Leav¬ing Cesarea, they coasted along Syria to Sidon, then crossedto Myra, a port of Lycia; thence to Cnidus, from which, onaccount of unfavourable winds, they struck across to Crete,and with difficulty reached the Fair Haven, a port on thesouthern part of that island, near the town of Lasea. TherePaul urged the centurion under whom he and his fellow-prisoners were placed to winter, but the place not being verysuitable, and the weather improving, they again set sail forPhoenice, another port on the same island, w here they couldw inter with safety. Scarcely, however, had they left port,when a tempest arose, at the mercy of which they were drivenfor fourteen days in a westerly direction, until they were caston the coast of Malta, where they suffered shipwreck, butwithout any loss of life. Hospitably received by the natives,they abode there three months, during which time Paulpreached the gospel, and performed many miracles amongthe people.On the approach of spring, they set sail in a ship ofAlexandria, which had wintered in the island, for Syracuse,thence crossed to Rhegium in Italy, and thence to Puteoli,from which they journeyed to Rome. Here Paul wasdelivered by the centurion to the captain of the guard, whopermitted him to dwell in his own hired house under thesurveillance of a soldier. And thus he continued for twoyears, preaching the kingdom of God, and writing for theuse of the church, no man forbidding him.By what means Paul was delivered from the accusation ofthe Jews we have no account; but it is supposed that, nothaving sufficient proof of what they alleged against him, orfinding that it was no violation of the Roman law, they durstnot implead him before the emperor, and so permitted himto be discharged.After leaving Italy, Paul, accompanied by Timothy, prose¬cuted his long intended journey into Spain, and according toseveral writers, crossed the sea, and preached the gospel inBritain. He continued in these western parts for eight or24nine months, after which he repaired to Sicily, Greece, andCrete. He afterwards went to Rome, where, with Peter, hewas cast into prison, in the general persecution raised againstthe Christians, under pretence that they had set fire to thecity. It is uncertain how long he remained in prison, nordo we know whether he was scourged before his execution;but authorities agree that he was beheaded three miles fromRome, and was buried in the Via Ostiensis, about two milesfrom Rome, where, about the year 317, Constantine theGreat built a stately church over his grave, and adorned itwith a hundred marble columns, and beautified it with themost exquisite workmanship.St. Paul seems, indeed, to have been eminently fitted forthe apostleship of the Gentiles, to contend with and confutethe grave and the wise, the acute and the subtle, the sageand the learned of the heathen world, and to wound themwith arrows from their own quiver. He seldom, indeed, madeuse of learning and philosophy, it being more agreeable tothe designs of the gospel, to confound the wisdom and learn¬ing of the world by the plain doctrine of the cross.What he taught to others he practised himself; his “con¬versation was in heaven,” and his desires were “to depart,and to be with Christ:” and hence it is very probable, thathe always led a single life, though some of the ancients rankhim among the married apostles.His kindness and charity were remarkable ; he had a com¬passionate tenderness for the poor, and a quick sense of thewants of others. To what church soever he came, it wasalways one of his first cares to make provision for the poor,and to stir up the bounty of the rich and wealthy: nay, heworked often with his own hands, not only to maintain himself,but also to help and relieve the poor. But his charity to thesouls of men was infinitely greater, fearing no dangers, re¬fusing no labours, going through good and evil report, thathe might gain men over to the knowledge of the truth, andbring them out of the crooked paths, and place them in thestraight way that leadeth to life eternal.THE END.

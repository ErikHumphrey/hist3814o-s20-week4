GAnd the hectic spot is spreading now.O’er her wan cheek of woe.Tis night, fond ones bend o’er her,With kind affection’s fears ;As though they could restore herBy their anguish and their tears :No hope their hearts need borrow,For the watchdog’s doeful cries,Tell the painful tale of sorrow.Ere morning’s light she dies.She gazes round her wildly,When that sad sound is heard.Then greets her lov’d ones mildly,With a parting soul’s regard ;But ere the morning’s sun has shone,That fair one breathes no more,And the faithful watchdog’s warning moanIs also hush’d and o’er.THE HEATHER BELL.Oh! deck thy hair wi’ the heather bell.The heather bell alone ;Leave roses to the Lowland maid,The Lowland maid alone.I’ve seen thee wi’ the gay, gay rose,And wi’ the heather bell,—J love you much with both, fair maid ;But, wear the heather beh.For the heather bell, the heather bell,Which breathes the mountain air.Is far more tit than rbses gayTo deck thy flowing hair.Away, away, ye roses gay !The heather bell for me ;Fair maiden, let me hear thee say,The heather bell for me,Then twine a wreath o’ the heather bell,I'he heather bell alone ;Nor rose nor lily twine ye there—The heather bell alone,For the heather bell, the heather bell,Which breathes the mountain air,Is far more fit than roses gayTo deck thy flowing hair.YE MARINERS OF ENGLAND.Ye mariners of England,Who guard our native seas.Whose flag has braved a thousand yearsThe battle and the breeze!Your glorious standard launch again,To match another foe,And sweep through the deep.While the stormy winds do blow.While the stormy winds do blow.While the stormy winds do blow,8While the battle rages long and loud,And the storraj tempests blow.The spirits of jour fathersWill start from every wave ;The deck it was their field of fame—The ocean was their grave.Where Blake and mighty Nelson fell,Your manly hearts will glow.As you sweep through the deep,While the stormy winds do blow.While the stormy winds do blow, &c.The meteor flag of EnglandMust yet terrific burn,Till the stormy night of war depart,And the star of peace return.Then to our faithful marinersThe social can shall flow.Who swept through the deepWhile the stormy winds did blow.While the stormy winds did blow,While the stormy winds did blow.While the battle raged long and loud,And the storms of war did blow.

walking was I,To meet my fweet Billy, he’ll come by & by,To meet him in the meadows is all my delight,A walking and talking from morning till night.Meeting is a pleafure, but parting is a grief,And an incondant lover is worfe than a thief,A thief can but rob me and take what I have,But an inconftant lover fends me to my grave.The grave it will rot me and bring me to duft.But an incondant lover no maiden can truft.The y’llkifsyou.they’llcourt you,poor girls todeceivcThere’s not one in twenty that you can believe.The cuckoo’s a fine bird, fhe fings where fhe flies.She brings us good tidings and

to outfhine my mammy,I figh’d for fringes, frogs, and beaux.For pig-tail wigs, and powder’d clothes,And filken mailer Sammy.For riches next I fet a flame.Old Gripus to my cottage came.And held an amorous parley.For mufic next I chanc’d to burn,And fondly liftcn’d in. my turn,To warbling quivering Charley.So now adike the fools and wits,Fops, fidlers, foreigners and cits,All itruck me by

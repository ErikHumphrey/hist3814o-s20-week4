now ye’re far awa’, love,Ye’re far awa’ frae me,O’er woodland glens, and rocky dens.And o’er the raging sea.7I itand upon the rocky shore,The rocky hills behind,I spy the distant ship afar,That’s driven with the wind.I see the waves around her rise,Ten thousand billows roar ;The foaming surges lash the skiesBehind her and before.Unto the winds I gave a sigh.Unto the waves a tear ; 'Up to the skies I send my cry,0 for my dearest dear.Kind Providence, oh! hear my voiceOh, wilt thou her life save ?Oh, keep her from the sunken rocks,And from a watery grave.For, though she’s borne awa’ frae meAcross the raging main,Our hapless loves may yet revive,Were we to meet again.THE CHOUGH AND CROW.The chough and crow to roost are gone,The owl sits on the tree,The hush’d wind wails with feeble moan,Like infant charitv.8The wild fire dances on the fen,The red star sheds its raj ;Up-rouse je then, my merry men,It is our opening day.Beth child and nurse is fast asleep.And closed is every flower,And winking tapers faintly peep,High from my lady’s bower ;Bewildered hinds with shortening ken,Shrink on their murky way ;Up-rouse ye then, my merry men,It is our opening day.Nor board nor garner own we now,Nor roof nor latched door,Nor kind mate, bound by holy vow,To bless a good man’s store.Noon lulls us in a gloomy den,And night has grown our day ;Up-rouse ye then, my merry men.And use it as ye may.A A •

THE OPEN SEA!The Sea! the Sea! the open Sea!The blue, the fresh, the ever free!Without a mark, without a bound,It runneth the earth’s wide regions round ;It plays with the clouds, it mocks the skies,Or like a cradled creature lies,I’m on the sea! I’m on the sea!I am where I would ever be ;With the blue above, and the blue below,And silence wheresoe’er I go.If a storm should come and awake the deep,What matter, I shall ride and sleep.What matter, <kc.I love—Oh, how I love to ride,On the fierce, foaming, bursting tide!When every mad wave drowns the moon,Or whistles aloft the tempest tune !And tells how goeth the world below.And why the south-west blast doth blow.I never was on the dull tamo shore,But I lov’d the great sea more and more ;And backwards flew to her billowy breast,Like a bird that seeketh its mother’s nest;And a mother she was, and is to me,For I was born on the open sea.For I was born, <fec.18The ■waves were white, and red the mom.In the noisy hour when I was born ;And the whale it whistled, the porpoise roll’d.And the dolphins bar’d their backs of gold:And never was heard such an outcry wild.As welcom’d to life the ocean child.I have liv’d since then in calm and strife,Full fifty summers a rover’s life,With wealth to spend and a power to range.But never sought or sigh’d for change.And death, whenever it comes to me,Shall come on the wild unbounded sea..

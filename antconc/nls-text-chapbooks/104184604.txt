Country;THE M UD - ND HER BARLEY.Cold agd raw the north Sid b!aw,bleak in the norniag early;AU the trees were covered with snaw,covered With wieter yearlyAs I was riding along the ploughk,I met a farmer's daughter,With rosy cheeks aad bonay brow,good fai h my chops did water.Down T wav'd my bonnet full low*meaning to shew my breeding.But she return'd a gracefal bow,with her wage fair exceeding.1 ask’d her where she was going so icon,I long’d to hold a parley.She told me to the next market town,on purpose fo sell her barley*la this purse, sweet soul said I,twenty pousds lies fairly,Seen norther one t > buy,far TU buy all thy barley.sIf tweaty pounds thould purchase deiighi,to one that l love so dearly,If yau will lie with me to-night,you'll go home in the morning oariyt'If twenty pounds should buy the globe,it's the thing : 11 never do, sir.For were my friends as poor as JobyI would never raise then so sir.For would you prove my friend oae night,we might get a young kid together.And you would be gone e’er nine month's end,pray where waul J 1 find a father ?O pray what would my lather say,if I should be so sillyAs to throw my maiden head away,and loss my true-love Billy ?For it would brng me to disgrace,therefore I say you uay, sir,But if that you would me embrace,first marry, and then you may, sir,Then I told her I had married beenfor four tee 4 years aad longer,EUe I would choose her for my queen,and fasten the kaot still stronger.X'4Then the bade nse no farther roam,meaning my wedlock fai.-ly,S» keep your purse for apouse at home,tome other

luur.j after,There I cnanced to meet afainthe farmer's honey daughter.AHho’ it was both raw and cold,I long’d to hold a ps tey.Once more to shew my pu^sf of goldwhen she had sold her barley.Love said I pray do not frown,but let us exchange embraces ;I’ll buy thee * silken gowa,- with ribbons, gloves and laces.A ring a id breast-pin muff and fas,no body shall hav« neater ;As I am an honest man,I ne’er saw a sweeter creature.sThen I took her by the hand,and said, my dearest j*we\ .Why should you disputing stand,I pray you be not cruel.She saw my mind waa fully bentto pleasure my desire,Inerefare she seemed to cor-ient,hut I wirh l had ne’et come nigh her.You talk of rlbb ns, gloves, and rings,and likewise go'd and treasure,O let me first enjoy these thingsthen you shall have yonr pleasure.Sure thy wiU shall be obeyed,said he, my own dear honey,Then into her lap he paidfull forty pounds in money.We’ll to the market town this day,straightway to end our quarrel.I’ll deck thee like a lady gay,in flourishing apparel.AH toy poki and silver thento her I did defver.And on the roa-3 we did repair,till coming to a river,6*The *ater wa> «o widi and deep*•uch waters I ne'er

and said, beholdTib not at your devotionBut sir l thank you for your gold,it will b'lp to enlarge my portion.Then I began to stamp and stare,to s^e what she had acted,Andtwith my hands I tore ay hair,like one that was distracted.Give me my money back again,good faith I did but lend it,But she full fast away did ride*and vow’d she ne’er intended.P\DDY WHACK.I atT out from Ulster, my own

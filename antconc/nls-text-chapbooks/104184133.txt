B.( s )XTRACTo F- AE T T E RFROM A( 4 )'A true ACCOUNT of the wonderfulConversion at Cambuflang*SIR,IN Anrwer to yours, in few Words, takethe following Account of the Work atCambufiang- Notwithftanding of all the JlSlur cafi upon it, I can take it to be no- Ithing but the mighty Po^erof God, con¬cur mg with the Means of Grace of God’s ownInftitution andAppointment,and,making a preach’d jGofpel mighty thro’ God to the pulling down oj jftrong Holds> die. And, after Itndc and impar¬tial Enquiry and Examination into its firlt Springand Rile, I tell you, that Mr. M'C’—~h hath,for a coiifiderable Time bypift, been praying fer¬vently for a Revival to decayed Religion, and thatGod might glorify himfelf in the Converfion of jSinners, be the Inftruments who will. And, afterhe had preached long upon the New Birth, hewas ublerved one Day in Prayer to exprels himfelf;l ord, who hath believed our Report * or to whomis the Arm of the Lord revealed} Where is theFruit of my poor Labours among this ‘People ?Upon his exprefling which Words, feverals in theCongregation inffantly cry’d out publickly. imult hkewife obftrve to you, that the People therehave beeen wondeifully given to private, kcrerand facial Prayer, and religious Conferences,fembling themjeives, as the Manner of fome is,and confederir.g one another to provoke to Loveana good Works. And, as there h.^s been unuloalwreltling and pouring forth of their Hearts irPrayer( 5 )Prayer, Interceffions and Supplications, it appearsevident to me that the Hearer of Prayer hathheard in Heaven his dwelling Place, and turnedtheir Prayers into their Bofom ; and, as they havebeen unufually exercifed, there’s unufual bruitsnow following thereupon : For,ifi. The Reverend Mr. M'C-—h> or fomeother for him, hath preached daily. Sabbaths andWeek-days, thefe five Weeks lall bypalt; and fe-veral Days he and another both.idly, Thefe publick Ordinances have been at¬tended with People in the Parifll, and out of theParifh, from diltant Places, thirlting after thefincere Milk of the Word.idly. Either before or after publick Worfhip,and ordinarily both, the People conveened in theManfe, the Church, or other convenient Placesfor Prayer, praifmg, reading the Scriptures, fol-ving Cafes of Confcience, religious Conferences,and the like godly F.xercifes.qrhly, At publick Ordinances there has appearved amidfl rhe whole Congregation great and un¬ufual Awaknings among the Hearers, infomuchthat feverals have been pricked in their Hearts,and cry’d out, 1 ke ‘Peter’s Hearers, Men andBrethren, ‘ivhat fnoll we do to he faved ? Otherslamenting their loif State, adding, “/hey have been‘Defpij'en ana Rejctiers of a crucified Chrifi. Andothers unable to conceal great Raptures of Joy intheir Believing, and ufmg all friendly Offices toadminiffer Confolation and Comfort to thole inSoul-trouble.yhly. There have been feveral drooping anddifconfolate Perlons, after fwooning amidlt theCongregation, carried to the Manfe, and attendedclofely( 6 )elordy there feveral Days and Nights hyMr.^C—#and other Minilters or Pteachers, and known ex¬perienced Chnftians appi oven by them, who havebeen at all Pains imag nable with them, prayingwith- and for them, folvuig their Do b'-s, andadminiltring Conlolation to them on Scripture-grounds.6th/y, Perfons thus exercifed have confidedmod of illiterate Folk, or of thole formerly or novery great Note Dr ChriftianKnowledge,Profeflionor Practice of Religion ; yet now, by all that ap¬pears to the Minifler and other folid judicious ex¬perimental Chridians, there’s a real, thorow anduniverfal Change wrought upon them ; and theConverts are modiy, tho’ not aLogether, youngOnes.Ttkfy, I’m credibly informed, that the apparentChange wrought at Cambujiavg, by Means of apreached Gofpel, doth prove irfelf to have beenreal by the bruits and good Ettefts that have fol¬lowed thereupon in their Lives, after they have^one Home ; particularly, their fpending fpareTime in fecret Retirements, pouring forth theirHearts in Prayer, and by their being drift andcircumfpeft in their After-walk and Converfation.%thly, As the Work holds on, and fume Per-fbns are newly awakned, which were not knownto be concerned before ; fo Mr. M'C—h feems torenew’ his Strength ; and notwithdanding of ex¬traordinary Fatigue and Toil, both in Seafon andout of Seafon, he feems to be more than ordinarilylively, prompt and extemporary, in all the Partsof his Miniderial Work.And tho’ I’m neither to fay that all who havebeen convifted haveaftually been converted, northatifthat the Conviftions of all have been alike deep,durable and genuine; yet T aflure you there’s beenDays of Power there, and luch Days as I rake tobe in Anfwer to the Prayers, Wilhes andlings of fuch as feek the Face of the God of facobwith their whole Hearts Defire, even yet in thisDay of Upfittennefs, D^adnefs and Formality:But fuch as are otherwife minded, they'll oblige meif they anfwer the fubfequent Queries.1. Where doth it appear that Satan everpromoted the Intereft of his Kingdom purely bythe preached Gofpel, fince’tis the very Device in¬finite Wifdom hath contrived for its Overthrow ?2. Where can we inftance that Satanwrought in People an earneft Defire and Thir-fting after the Ordinances as new-born Babes afterthe Breaft ?,0K 3. If it be not rather one of the Depths andDevices of Satan, to lull People afleep in Securityand Thoughtlefnefs about a future State, ratherthan to prompt them, jointly with exercifed Folk,to wake when others fleep, in praying, wrelHing,praifing, religious Conference, and propofingDoubts and Fears about their fpiritual State ?4. Doth it not appear evident that ’tis theSpirit of the Lord poured down, whA» we feeyoung Ones, not come to Age to difcern betwixtthe right Hand and the left in religious Concerns,having the Gift and the Grace of Prayer; as ap-»pears by their fervent Expoftulations, importunateWrefilings, and, in the Tongue of the Learned,fpeaking Words in Seafon to Chriftians of oldStanding ?5. Granting there may be Hypocrites amongthem, if fome have been brought favingly to be¬lieve( 8 )lieve the Report, can any deny that the Arm ofthe Lord hath been revealed ?6. Is it not the Manner of God, in dealingwith' adult Perfons, to begin the faving Work oftheir Converfion with convincing them ?^ 7. Whether or not it were better Conduftto he thankful for luch Revivings in a Day ofDeadnefs under the Ordinances, than entertaingroundlefs Prejudices and falle Afperlions, be theRaifers of them who will ?^ 8. Ought we not to conftrud: it as a 7'okenfor Good at the Hand of God, when, at this ex¬traordinary W >rk, ’tis evident he is fupplying hisServants with extraordinary Supports both inward¬ly and outwardly ?Thus, Sir, I have endeavoured to fatisfy youin anfwering your Letter.1 amGorbahy Marchaj. 1742.

Fair maid, can you fancy I ?You feem to on fome man of honour,fome man of honour you feem to me;Hour can you impofe on a poor young woman,that is not fit your fervant to be ?If you are not fit to be my fervant,I’ve got a great regard for thee;I thought to marry you, make you my lady,for I’ve got fervante to wait on thee.I have got a fweetheart all of my own, Sir,and fevcn long years fince he’s gone from me ?And feven more 1 will wait for him,if he’s alive, he’ll return to me.If it be feven years fince your love went from you,furely he’s either dead or drown’d.—If he is alive, I love him dearly ;and if he’s dead, 1 can wifh him reft.Rut when he found that his Sally was faithful,it’s a pity that love (hould be crofs’d,—I am your poor and Angle failor,that oftentimes the wide ocean ccofs'd.If you be my poor and fingle failor,Yliew me the token f gave to thee ;For feven years makes an alteration,fince my true love has gone from me.He pull’d his handout of his Worn,his fingers being long and finall;He fiiew’d the ring that was broke between them—■no fooner Ihe faw it, than down did fall.He took her up into his arms,and gave her kifies, one, two, by threeI am your poor and fingle failor,that’s juft return’d to marry thee.So, hand in hand, they went together,unto the church without delay,Where there he marry’d his lovely Sally,and made her his lady gay.THE FEMALE SOLDIER.WHEN I w:s a young girl, at the age of fifteen,I was courted by a young man moft rare to be feen sBut now to my grief, for a foldier he’s gone,And what to do for my love I will make known.I drefs’d myfelf up in fome men’s array,And went to the captain without more delay.Where I lifted myfeli for a drummer fo ftrong.In the very fame regiment where my love belong’d.The very next morning the route it came.That the fame rigment to Jamaica was bound ;And over the plain as we marched-along,1 charmed my love by the found of the drum.^ beat up my little drummer, the colonel reply’d,i ou ftiall be advanc’d from a drummer this day ;The very next day a lieutenant I was made,For to handle my pen 1 never was afraid.The very next day my love’s trial came on,i or miffing of his duty, as you may underftand,[ 4 ]WhenlbeggM bis forgivenefs & did him embrace#And before the whole reigment I op’ned my cafe.The very next morning my love and f was wed,The colonel made him lieutenant in my dead ;And now, for my courage, as plain as you may fee,Ihia has been the upmakingof my love and me.T*'THE TRUE HEARTED MAIDENFArewel my dear jewel, my own heart’s delight.Since war now alarms you in battle to fight,Acrofs the wide billows, quite over the main,Never, no never fhall 1 fee you again.For her true love fhe moan’d by night & by day,And exclaim’d ’gainll thofe that forc’d him away,I wifh that the fword in their breaft may remain.Till my true love returns to my arras back again.My life for his fake, I freely would yield,It grieves me to think that his blood fhould ba fpill’dJ’ll go into battle where bullets they do fly,I’ll fight for my love for my true love I’ll die.The drums did beat and the trumpets did found.The cannons were roaring Sr lhaking the ground,Her heart it did tremble between hope and fear.Yet fhe found out the young man (he lov’d fo dear.Acrofs the wide ocean I’ll fwim on my breaft,Till I find out my true love I never can reft,1 wifh that the bullets may mifs him and fly,And flrike thro’ the heart of his great enemy.When the battle was over, fhe flew to his arms,He thought that an angel appeared in her charms;In his arms he embrac’d her all joy to reftore.But I cannot return till the wars arc all o’er.C 5 3She went to his Captain and to him did fay.For this young man’s difchargf 40 guineas I’ll pay,Refolved to marry the man I adore,For I never can flay till the wars are all o’er.What can be fo ftrong in the heart as true love.When deck’d in beauty by the Powers above,It never will flatter, diflemble, nor fly,With my love I’ll live, with my true love I’ll die.THE FORSAKEN NYMPH.A Walking, a talking, and a walking was I,To meet my fweet Billy, he’ll come by and by.To meet him in the meadows is ail my delight,A walking and talking from morning till night.Meeting is a pleafure, but parting is a grief,And an inconftant lover is worfe than a thief,A thief can but rob me and take what I have.But an inconltant lover fends me to my grave.The grave it will rot me and bring me to dufl.But an inconftant lover no maiden can truft,They’ll kifs you,and court you, poor girls to deceiveThere’s not one in twenty that you can believe.The cuckoo’s a fine bird, (he fings where (he flies,She brings us good tidings and tells us no lies,She fucks of fweet flowers to keep her voice clearThe mere (he fings cuckoo, the fummer draws near.Come all ye pretty maidens wherever ye be,Don’t fettle your mind in a fycamore tree,The leaf it will wither, and the root it will die,And if I’m forfaken, I know not for why,THE GIN DRINKER’S FR OLIC.AS thro’

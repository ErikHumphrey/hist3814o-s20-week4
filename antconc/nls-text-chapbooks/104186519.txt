His Pro.phefies have been more credited than anythat were ever recorded in the Scots Chroni-e'e, as they have been well attefted, what o:them is paft5 and what they allude to, in thkprefent cantury and period, and of his dartfayings yet to come.He told many myftical pmphefies anentall the kings of Europe, and what fell oulaccording to his prediction, in this ancienkingdom of Scotland; what is p&ft, prelenand to come.This brief account is taken from the R«:cords of Cryle, near which place he was burrand brought up.— -( .3 )His father vt?.s laid to be Laird of "Bal-coraie ; and the Records of that family is ex¬tant in the Rolls, for their affixing at feveralCouncils for the honour of Scotland. AndSir Thomas Rymer’s Prophefies and layingsare Hill held in efteem.He lived in the reign of Alexander III.King of Scotland, in the year One thoufand,two hundred and forty-eight, much regarded,and knighted by that king that fame year.The firit of his prophelies ever taken to befaithfully obferved, was. That there fhouldbe a llorm on a certain day, that would fur-j prife all Scotland. Nov/, fome gentlemenbeing with him that day, they began to jokehim, and laid, Sir Thomas, you are now mif-taken, and we Ihall Hay andTee your miftake,as we have heard lb much of your prophefies.He told them to flay an hour longer, and theywould fee and believe. And ih lefs time thanthe hour, an exprefs arrived to Sir Thomasfrom Edinburgh, of the death of Margaret,Queen to Alexander III. who died that day.Upon receiving the news, Sir Thomas told■them that this was the ftorm, and it wouldgive rife to greater commotions it Scotland.After the Jeaih of Queen Margaret, theKing married Ifabel, daughter to the Earlof Driux: And Sir Thomas told, within a fewmonths, of an earthquake at Kinghorn, thatwould make Scotland tremble. An exprefsaccordingly came to Clyde, to Sir Thomas< 4 >that the King had fallen from his-'horfe atKinghorn, and broke his neck, which .hap¬pened accordingly. After the death of Alex¬ander, he left no heirs, except a grand¬child, Margaret, daughter to the King ofNorway, who alfo foon died; but a fhort timebefore her death, file was betrothed to Eaward,King of England. After this there was greatcommotions anent the fuccefhon to the crownof Scotland, which occafn»ned great bloodIhed,particularly betwixt Bruce and Baliol, whichyou have recorded in the Scottifh Riftories.The pride of Spain, and the deceitful con-dndt of the French, as alfo concerning theDutch, is all foretold. Likewife the Scotsbattles, at Tor-wood, Bothwel-bridge, Mal-plackie, Shirreff muir. Proud-Prefton, nearGladfmuir, Falkirk, Culloden, and the Campsin Moray (hire, and on the Wind-mi'l-braeat Aberdeen, by General Coup. And atDunbar.Jn forty-five^ eighty-two arid three.Sir 'Thomas Works doth certife.As to his prophetical fayings, they are hardto be underllood, becaufe they are pointed outby the Coats of Arms, which appertain to fomany different Kingdoms and perfons. Yet -we may cbferve how he has pointed out plain¬ly, ‘many things which has come to pais inuai Jays; fuch as the extirpation of the noblei race of tTie Stewarts, the Revolution, SherrillI muir : Where he fays,x Three Ships and a Shield,That day Jhall keep the field.And be the Antelope't build.Thefe three Ships and a Shield are in thei Duke of Argyle’s Arms.And even every particular of the rebellionin 1745 and 46: When pointing at it, he fays,A Chief tan uncbofenShall cboofe forth bimfelfAnd rule the realm as his own.When fpeaking of King Charles, he callshim, “ A fly for-bird, who would turn to“ Ghrift, with the wyles of tods and foxes.”fMeaning his fwearing of the covenants.When fpeaking of the Battle of Preflon-pans, in the year 1745, he names the verytwo neighbouring villages to the fpot of groundwhereon it was fought, viz. Goyfeford-green,and Seton, faying, “ Between Seton and thefea, forrow fhould be wrought by the lightof the moon.” Which aft really came topfs, that morning the battle of Prefton-Pa»jwas fought. But how the Lion was hurt atthis time, and not perceived, is yet a myflery.nome are of opinion, that it was by takingiway the power or fuperiority from the Chiefs:>f the Highland Clans, fo that they cannotaife men in fuch a fliort time as formerly.Thefe are a few of the obfervations we'take on things already come to pafs; and■,'i' T' - ' '' v- ... / . - • -as to what is yet to come, there is fome re«mark will yet happen, when the time drawsnigh : Such as, “ When Tarbet’S Craigs aretumbled into the Tea : And the next feafon“or film me r thereafter, great farrow and“ bloodfhed happen to this realm,. the chief“ thereof, efpecially inch as barling on fled^,“and chopping off heads..” This Tarbetftands near the root of the river Clyde : butwhether its being tumbled into the fea, {hallhappen by. an. earthquake, thunder, or by thehands of men, is. a myltery unknown.There .is..alfo mention made of a Lord witha lucken or double hand, which certainly isof royal blood, and will breed great ftir andconfufion in Britain. This man is alive inthis very prefent age, .and of the Stewart’srace, now in Italy. There is plainly pointedout, that in his time, a great .battle fuall befeen in Fife,Where faddled borjes ftiould be feen^Tied unto the trees green.Not only in Fife, but the four chief riversof the realm, there (liould be a.battle on each !of them, that ihould make the rivers run withblood, viz.

Rymer obferving that he came to|the wrong perfon, and that he could obtainf 74 )'but little from him, faid, “ I have but threefhiilings, which are not worth a icuffle ; tomuch good may they do you; but, as a friend,let me tell you, you are going on ir a verybad way.” The robber t<$>k them, and with¬out alkiirg him for more, walked away, withan air of dejection and terror.The fellow was no fooner gone, than'T'homasordered his page to follow the robber, to ob-ferve where he went,, and to bring hin an ac¬count of all he Ihould difcover. The boy o-beyed, purfued him through feteralobfcureftreets, and at length,, faw him enter ; baker’sfhop, where he obferved him chan;e one ofthe fhiilings, and buy a large brown loaf.—With this falutary purchafe the relber wenta few doors further, and, entering in alley,afeended feveral pair of liars. Theooy creptup after him to the topmeft llory, where hefaw him go into a room, which wasno other-wife illuminated than by the friendy light ofthe moon ; and peeping through a cevjce, heperceived the wretched man call tie loaf onthe floor, and, burlling into tears, cry out,u There, eat your fill; this is the dearelt loafI ever bought: I have robbed a genfeman ofthree {hillings; let us hufband them veil, and1st me have no more teazings ; for £001 or latethefe dungs mull bring me to ruin.’ Theexpoflulations were aniwered by thofe of thewhole family: and his wife, having a: lengthcalmed th« agony of his mind, took up the loaf.and cutting it, gave four pieces to four poorI ftarving children.—The page having thus per¬formed his commiffion, returned home, andgave his mafter an account of all he had feenaad heard.—Satisfied with this account, Ry-mer afcended to the Shoe-maker’s lodging,and knocked at the door : It was opened bythe unhappy man himfelf; who knowing himat fidt fight to be the gentleman whom he hadrobbed, proftrated himfelf at his feet. Rymerdefired him to make no noife, afluring hinv^bathe had not the leaft intention to hurt him.—■“ You have a good chara&er, faid he, amongyour neighbours; but you mull expe£l yourlife will be cut fhort, if you are fo wicked asto continue the freedoms yon took with m«.Hold your hand, here are 30 (hillings to buyleather; huiband it well, and fet your childre*-a laudable example.” Well done Thomas.Scotland br fad now, and lament,for honours thou halt loll,But yet rejoice in better times,,which will repay the coft.Fair Scotia’s en’mies may invade,but not efcape a plague ;With fword & third, & tears & pefl,with, fears and iuch-Iike ague.( «« )ANACCOUNTof theBATTLE or BANNOCKBURN,King Edward II. of England having keptup the fame claim upon Scotland, which hisfather had begun ; after feveral tmfuccefsfulattempts to edablifh it, he refolved to makea great effort, and with one blow reduce thatturbulent nation, which had put fo many figttalaffronts upon his father and himfelf.In the fpring 1314, he aflembled the mollnumerous army that had ever crofted the bor¬ders, compofed of different nations, and amount¬ing to above too 000 effective men, befide a ihuge multitude of attendants, who came along,in hopes of fharing in the plunder of a con¬quered enemy. At the head of thefe he march¬ed northward with an uncommon parade, andin full confidence of victory.Robert Bruce, the Ion of that Robert Brucewho held a conference with Wallace upon thebanks of the Carron, and grandfon to him whohad been competitor with Baloil, had, in 1306,been crowned King of Scotland; and being in¬formed of Edward’s formidable preparations,he railed an army of 30,000. of his fubje£ts,to oppofe Kim. This armament bore but »fmall proportion to that of Edward’s; but it( was compofed of foldiers who were hardenedby long practice of war, and who now carriedupon the point of their fword, liberty and hon¬our, and every thing that was dear to them.With thefe Robert took up his ftaticn in theneighbourhood of Stirling, and waited forEdward’s arrival.The two armies came in fight of each otherin the month of June, and loon after a bloodybattle was fought, in which the Scots obtaineda vi&ory, the moft celebrated cf any in theannals of that kingdom. The procedure ofthis memorable event was as follows.(The Englilh having marched from Edin¬burgh lo Falkirk in one day, and upon themorrow, fetting out from thence towards Stir¬ling, encamped to the northward of the Tor-wood. About Upper-Bannockburn, and back¬ward upon the Muir of Plalin, in the neigh¬bourhood of the ancient Roman Gafway, piecesof broken pots, and other veffels, have beenfound; and upon rocks near the furface, marksof fire have been difcovered, where it was fup-pofed the foldiers had made ready their pro-viiions. Barbour, the author of King RobertBruce’s life, fpeaks as if their camp hadftretched fo far northward as to occupy a partof carlcrgrouad ; and fo vaft a multitude muftdoubtlefs have covered a large tract of thecountry. The Scoaifh army was polled aboutf *8 )a mile to the northward, upon feveral fmalleminencies, fouth from the prelent village ofSt. Ninian*. Upon the fummit of one of thefe•minencies, now called BrockVbrae, is a ftonefunk into the earth, with a round hole in it,near three inches in diameter, and much thefame in depth, in which, according to tradition.King Robert's ftandard was fixed, the royaltent having been ere£ted near it. This ftoneis well known in that neighbourhood by thename of the Bore-ftone. The fmall river ofBannockburn, remarkable for its fteep andrugged banks, ran in a narrow valley betweenthe two camps. The Caftle of Stirling wasftill in the hands of the Englifh. Ed#ar<iBruce, the King’s brother, had, in the fpringef this year, laid liege to it, but found himfelfobliged to abandon the enterprise; only bya treaty between that Prince and Moubray,the Governor, it was agreed, that, if the gar-rifon received no relief from England beforea year expired, they ftiouJd farrender to theScots. The day preceding the battle, a ftrongbody of cavalry, to the number of 800, wasdetached fram the Engiilh camp, under theconduct of Lord Clifford, to the relief of that.garrrfon. Thefe having marched through fourshollow grounds, upon the edge of the Carfe,had palled the Scots army before they wereobferved. The King himfetf was the firft thatperceived them, and defiring Thomas Ran¬dolph, Earl of Murray, to look towards theI( *9 >ilace wliere they were, told him, that a rofelad fallen from his chaplet. Randolph con-idering this as a reproach, becaufe he had thecharge of that part through which the Englilh[lad marched, immediately fet out after them|ivith a party of 500 horfe, and coming up withthem, in the plain where the Imall village ofNew-houfe now Hands, a lharp a£ticn enfued,in fight of both armies, and of the garrifon of(Stirling. It was fought with valour on bothTides ; and it was for fome time doubtful whereivi&ory Ihould turn. King Robert, attendedby fome of his officers, beheld this rencounterfrom rifing ground, fuppofed to be the roundrhill immediately upon the weft of St. Ninian’s,mow called Cock-fliot-hill. James Douglasperceiving the diftrefs of Randolph, who wasgreatly inferior to the enemy in numbers,i afked leave to go to his fupport. This King• Robert atfrft refufed, but afterwards confent-led. Douglas put his foldiers in motion : cb-lerving^owever, as he was on the way, thatthe victory was upon the point of being wonwithout his afliftance, he flopped Ihort, thathis friend might have the unrivalled glory of it.The Englilh were entirely defeated, and many: of them (lain : and Randolph returned to the: camp amidft acclamations of univerfal joy.To perpetuate the memory of this vi&ory,two ftones were reared up in the field, and areftill to be feen there. They Hand in a fpotwhich has lately been enclofed for a garden,the village of Kevvhouf*, iand about a quarter of a mile from the Bo- irough-port of Stirling. This victory gave'1new fpirits to the whole army, and made them :fo eager for the general engagement, that the inight, though among the fhortefl of the year,|feemed long to them, Edward too, exafpe-rated at the defeat of his detachment, was de-'termined to bring on the battle on the morrow.At length appeared the dawn of that inj-portant day, which was to decide whether Scot¬land was henceforth to be an independent king¬dom, or fubjeft to a foreign yoke. Early all Iwas in motioa in both armies; religious.fenti-ments were mingled with the military ardour |iof the Scots : A folemn mafs, in the mannerof thefe times, was faid by the Abbot of In-chaffery, a monallry in Strathearn, who alibiadminifiered the Sacrament to the King, and Itthe great officers about him, while inferiorpriells did the fame to the reft of the army.—After this, they formed in order of battle, in ■a track of ground called Nether-Touchadaro,"which lies along the declivity of a»gentle riling ;hill: This fuuation.had been previoufly chofen, 1,becaufe of its advantages. Upon the right theyhad a range of fteep rocks,now called Murray’sCraig, and in their front were Iteep banks ofthe rivulet of Bannockburn. Not far behindthem was a wood, fome veftiges of which Hill fremain. Upon the left was a morafs, nowcalled Miltoi-bog, from its vicinity to a fmall(at the north end of. mage cf that name : much of this bog isftillinurained, and a part of it is at prefent a miil-As it was then the middle of fummer,am.'ll,Dt was almoft quite dry : But King Robertad recourfe to a itratagem, in order to pre-ent any attack from that quarter. He hadirdered many ditches and pits to be digged inhe morafs, and {lakes, fharpened at both ends,jjo be driven into them, and the whole to belovered over again with green turf, fo that theround had {{ill the appearance of being firm,e alfo caufed crow-feet or fharp-pointed ironsbe fcattered throughout the morafs; feme ofL’hich have been found there, in the memoryf people ftill living : the fame manoeuvresvere likevvife carried on for a little way along;he front of the left wing ; for there the banksor about two hundred yards, being flater thaashey are any-where elfe, it was the only placei|/here the enemy could pafs the river in any- 3rt of order. By means of thefe artificial im-rovements, joined to the natural llrength of: ae ground, the Scotch army flood as withinn entrenchment, and the invifible pits anditches anfwered to the concealed batteriesf more modern times. Araongft the other! ccurrences of this memorable day, hifloriansmention an incident of a Angular nature. ais the two armies were about to engage, thelibbot of InchafFery polling himfelf before thecots, with a Crucifix in his hand, they alldl down upon their knees in of devotion.'The enemy obferving them in fo uncommosia pofture, concluded that they we e frightecinto fubmiffion; and that, by kneeling, wherthey ihould be ready to light, they meant tCfarrender at difcretion, and only begged theiilives ; but they were loon undeceived, wheuthey faw them rife again, and Hand to theiiarms with fteady countenance.The Englilh began the adlion, by a briflj•barge upon the left wing of the Scots, com;manded by Randolph, near the fpot v.'her*the bridge is now thrown over the river, at the1£mall village of Gharterfhall. Hereabout wagthe only place where the river could be crche.in any order. A large body of cavalry advan«ed to attack him in front, while another fetched a compafs to fall upon his flank and rearbut before they could come to a clofe engagenient, they fell into the fnare that had been laicfor them. Many of their horfes were foon dif |abled by the ftiarp irons milling into their feet iethers tumbled into the concealed pits, antcould not difcntangle themfelves. Pieces othe harnefiing, with bits cf broken fpears, am ,cither armour, ftill continue to be dug up itthe bog. In the beginning of the engagemerian incident happened, which though in itfelliof fmall moment, was rendered important bjfits confequences. King Robert was mountet!on horfeback, carrying a battle-ax in his hand,and upon his helmet he wore a high turbarin the form of a crown, by way of diftin£Uo*. (.23 )This, together with his activity, rendered hint■ery confpicnous, as be rode before the lines,i tn Englifh Knight, nained Bohun, who wasanked among the bravefi: in Edward’s army,■■ame galloping furioufly up to him, in ordero engage with him in lingle combat, expecting)y fo eminent an a£t of chivalry, at once toout an end to the conteli, and gain immortalrenown to himfelf; but the enterprizing cham-iaion having miffed hisfirft blew, was immedi¬ately {truck dead with the battle-ax which theKing carried in his hand. This was a fortbf fignal for the charge. So bold an attack{ipon their King, filled the Scots with fenti-iments of revenge ; and the heroic atchieve-inent performed by him before their eyes,,lithe royal exploit raifed their fpirits to theitgheft pitch. They ruffled furioufly upon' the enemy, who, having by this time paffedthe river in great numbers, gave them a warmreception.—A fmgular occurrence, winch feme►accounts reprefen t as an accidental fally ofDatriotic enthufiafm, ethers as a premeditatedtflratagem of King Robert, fuddenly altered'the face of affairs, and contributed greatly tothe vittory : All the fervants and attendantsbf the Scottifh army, who are faid to haveamounted to twenty thoufand, had been order¬ed, before the battle, to retire fcehindMurray’sGraig. But having, during the engagement,1 arranged themfelves in a martial form, theymarched to the top cf the hill, and difplaying( 24 )wliit® flieets fixed upon p; les, infiead of ban¬ners, moved towards the field of battle witnhideous fit uts. The Englifli perceiving thismotely crowd, and taking them for a frefnreinforcement advancing to fupport the Scots,were feized with fo great a panic, that they!began to give way in confufion. Buchananifays, that the King of England was the firl’iwho fled ; but in this he contradicts all otherhiftorians, who affirm that he was among thelaft in the fi«ld.The Scots purfued, and great was theflaflghter among the enemy, efpectally in paf-fing the river, where they could keep no orderbecaufe of the irregularity of the ground.King Edward himfelf efcaped with muchdifficulty, being clofely purfued for above fortymiles by Sir James Douglas, with a party oflight horfe. He was upon the point of beingtaken prifoner, when he was received intothe Gaftle of Dunbar by the Earl of March,who conveyed him to England by fea in afifher’s boat, his immenfe army being entirelydifcomfited.The Scots loft only four thoufand men,while the lofs of the Englifh amounted to :above thirty thoufand.FINIS.

The battle of Prestonpam;To which is added,WALY, WALY.THE BATTLE OF PRESTONPANJ.Tfee Chevalier being void of fear,did march up Bridie brae man ;And through Tranent e'er he did stent,as fast as he could gae man,While general Cope did taunt and mock,wi' mony a loud huaea man ;But e'er next morn proclaim'd the cock,we heard anither craw man.The brave Lochiel as I heard tell,led Camerons on in clouds naan,The morning fair did clear the air,they loosed with devlish thuds man.Down guns they threw and swords they drew,an! soon did chace them aff man ;On Seaton crafts they built tkeir drafts,and gart them rin like daft man.The bluff drsgoons swore blood and 'oons,thej'd make the rebels run naan ;And yet they flee when them they *ee,and wiana/rte a gun man.sThey turn'd their bacir, the foot they brake,such terror seized them a’ man,Some wet their cheeks aome fyl'd their breeks,and some for fear did fa' man.The volunteers prick’d up their earsiand vow but they were crouse man:I But when the bairns they saw't turn to earn'st,they were not worth a louse man.Maist feck gaed hame, 0 fy for shame,they'd better staid awa man ;Then wi' eockade to make paradeand do nae good at a' man,Monteath the Rreat, when hersei* shot,up.'wares did ding hi* o’er man.Yet wad nae stand to bear a hand,but aff did fl je like stour man;O'er Soutra-hiil o'er h« »tood still,before he tasted meat man;Troth he may brsg cf his sweet nag,that bare him aff sae sleet man.And Seatoa keen to clear the esn,of rebels far in wrang man ;Did never strive wi' pistols five,bat gallop’d with the thrang man:4He turned his back and in a crack,was cleanly cut of sight man ;And though it best, it was nae jest,wi Highlanders to tight man.‘Mong a1 the gang nane bade the bang,but twa aud ane was tane man;For Campbell rade, but Morie staid,and sair he paid the kain man.Fell ikelps be got was wain than shot,f'ae the sharp-edged claymore man,Fiae moii'7 a spout came running outhis recking red hot gore naan.Bat Gard'ner brave did still behave*like to a hero bright man,His courage true like him were few,that still despised flight man ;For king aad laws and country's cause,in honour's bed he lay man,His life but not his courage fled,while he had breath to draw man.And Major Boyle that worthy soul,was brought down to the ground man,His horse beisg shot it was his lot,to; to get many a wound man !£Lieutenant Smith of Irish birth,'frae whom he call'd for aiR manBeing full of dread lap o'er his head,and would net be gainsaid man.He made sueh haste, sae spurr'd his beast‘twas little there he saw, man ;To Berwick rade, and falsely said,rhe Scots are rebels a‘ mao :But let that end for well 'tis kend,his use and wont to lie man ;The league is nought, he never sought,when he h»d room to flee man.But gallant Kodgcr, like a sodger,stood and bravely fought manrI'.Ti wae to tell at last he fell,but mae down wi‘ him brought man :At point of death, wi‘ his last breath,(some standing round ia ring man)On's bafck lying flat he waved his hat,and cried, God save the king man.Some Highland rogues like hungry dogs,neglecting to pursue man,About they fac’d and in great hasteupon the booty flew man.6And they as gaia, for all their p«iuare deck'd wi‘ spoils o‘ war man ;Fu‘ bauld can tell how her nainsel',s?as ne’er sae pra‘ pefore msn.At the thorn tree, which you may see,bewest the Meadow- mill man,'i here mony slain lay on the plain,the clans pursuing still man,Sic unco' backs and deadly whaks,I never saw tbe like man.Lost hands and heads cost them their deeds,that fell at Preston-Dyke man.That afternoon when a was done,I gaed to see the fray man ;But I had wist what after past,I d better staid awa man :On Seaton sands* wi‘ nimble handr,they pick’d my pockets bare man ;But/I wish ne'er to prie sic fear,for a‘ the sum and mair man.WaLY, WALY.0 WALY, waly up yon bankAnd waly, waly, down yon brae,7And waly by yon river side,Where I and my love wont to gae,0 waly, waly, love is bonnie,A little while when it is new:Bat when its auH it waxes cauld.And wears awa’ like morning dew.1 leant my back unto an aik,I thought it was a trusty tree;But first be bow'd, and then it brake,And sac did my fause love to me.When cockle-shells turn silver bells,And mussels grow on ev'ry tree.When frost and snaw shall warm us a',Then shall my love prove true by me.Now Arthur’s seat shall be my bed,The sheets shall ae’er be fyl’d by me;St Anthon’s well shall be my drink,Since my fause love's forsaken me.Q Marfmas wind when wilt thou blaw,And shake the green leaves aff the tree;O gentle Death, when wilt thou come,And tak a life that wearies me.It's not the frost that freezes fell.Nor blawiag snaw's inclemency;8It's not the cauld that makes me cry,But my love's heart grown cauld to me.When we came in by Glasgow town,We were a comely sight to see;My love was clad in velvet black,And I myself in cramasie.But had I wist before I kist,That love had been sae ill to win,i’d lock'd my heart in a case of gold,And pin'd it with a silver pin,Oh ! oh ! if my young babe were bora,And set upon the rursc s knee;And I mysel were dead and ganeiFor mail again 111 never be.FINIS,

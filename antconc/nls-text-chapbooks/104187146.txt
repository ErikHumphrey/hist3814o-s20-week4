—But when the bolt of death is hurl'd,Ah ! whither then with ihee to fly,Shall Outalissi roam the world ?—Seek we thy once loved home?—The hand is gone that cropp'd its flowers !Unheard their clock repeats its hours !Cold is the hearth within their bowers !And should wre thither roam,Its echoes, and its empty tread,Would sound like voices from the dead !Or shall we cross yon mountains blue,Whose streams my kindred nation quaff'd,And by mv side, in battle true,A thousand warriors drew the shaft?—Ah ! there, in desolation, cold,The desert-serpent dwells alone,Where grass o'ergrow each mouldering bone.And stones themselves to ruin grown,Like me, are death like oldThen set k we not their camp—for there—The silence dwells of my despair !But hark, the trump ! —to morrow thouIn glory's fires shall dry thy tears !Even from the land of shadows nowMy father's awful ghost appearsAmidst the clouds that round us roll !He bids my soul for battle thirst—He bids me dry—the last !—the first!The o»ly tears that ever burstFrom Outalissi s soulBecause I may not stain with griefThe death-soug of an Indian chief."JHOW d'ye-do, and good-bye.One day Good-bye met How-d^c-do,Too close to shun saluting;But soon the rival sisters flewFrom kissing to disputing.Away !“ says How-d(ye-do,“ your mineAppals my cheerful nature ;No name so sad as yours is seenIn sorrow's nomenclature.Where'er I give one sunshine hourYour cloud comes in to shade it;Where'er I plant one bosom's flower,Your mildew drops to fade it.Ere How-d'ye-do has turned each tongueTo ‘hope's delighted measure,'Good bye in friendship's ear has rungThe knell of parting pleasure !From sorrows past, my chemic skillDraws smiles of consolation ;While you, from present joys, distillThe tears of separation. “Good-bye replied," Your statement's true,And well your cause you've pleaded;But, pray, who'd think of How-d'ye-do,Unless Good-by preceded !Without my prior influence,Could yours have ever flourish'd-;And can your hand one flower dispense,But those my tears have nuorish’d ?How oft,—if’ at the court of loveConcealment is the fashion,'—When How-d’ye-do has fail’d to move,Good-bye reveals the passion ?How oft, when Cupid’s fires decline,—As every heart remembers,One sigh of mine, and only mina,Revives the dying embers ?Go, bid the timid lover choose,And I’ll resign my charter,If he for ten kind How-d’ye do’s,One kind Good-bye would barter !From love and friendship’s kindred sourceWe both derive existence;And they would both lose half their forceWithout one joint assistance.’Tis well the world our merit knows,Since time, there’s no denying,One half in How-d’ye-doing goes,And t’other in Good-bying.GERTRUDE VON DER WARTHer hands were clasp’d, her dark eyes raised,The breeze threw back her hair;Up to the fearful Wheel she gazed;All that she loved was there !The night was round her clear and cold,The holy heaven above,Its pale stars watching to beholdThe might of earthly love.3And bid me not depart, she cried,My Rudolph; say not so;This is no time to quit thy side;Peace—peace—i cannot go.Hath the world aught for me to fear, jWhen death is on thy brow?The world—what means it ?—mine is hereI will not leave thee now !I have been with thee in thine hourOf glory and of bliss;Doubt not its memory’s living power,To strengthen me through this.And thou, mine honour’d lord and true,Bear on, bear nobly on ;We have the blessed heaveti in view,Whose rest shall soon be won.“And were not these high words to flowFrom woman's breaking heart?Through all that night of bitterest woe,She’bore her lofty part.But oh ! with such a glazing eye,With such a curdling cheek,Love, love, of mortal agony.Thou only, thou shouldst speak !The wind rose high, but with it roseHer voice that he might hear;Perchance that dark hour brought reposeTo happy bosoms here.While she sat pining with despair,Beside his tortured form,And pouring her deep soul in prayer,Forth on the rushing storm.She wiped the death-dumps from hi« brow,With her pale hands and soft.Whose touch upon the late chords low,Had still’d his heart so oft.She spread her mantle o’er his breast;She bathed his lips with dew;And on his check such kisses press’d,As hope and joy ne’er knew.Oh ! lovely are ye, Love and Faith,Enduring to the last !he had her meed, one smile in death,And his worn spirit pass’d.While even as o’er a martyr’s grave,She knelt on that sad spot;And, weeping, bless’d the God who gaveHer strength to forsake it not!BILLY DIP.Chloe, a maid at fifty-five,Was at her toilette dressing;Her waiting maid, with iron hot,Each paper’d curl was pressing.The looking glass her eyes engross,While Betty humm’d a ditty;She gazed so much upon her face,She really thought it pretty.Her painted cheeks and pencil browsShe could not but approve,Her thoughts on varous subjects turn’d,At length she fix’d on love:<r And shall, “ said she,“ a virgin lifeAwait these pleasing charms?And will not sighing blooming youthReceive me to his arms?—8Forbid it. Love !“ She scarce had spoke,When Cupid laid a trap;For, at the chamber door was heardA soft and gentle rap :Cried Betty,“ who is at the door?*5“ Aye tell,55 quoth Chloe,55 true:55When straight a tender voice replied,55 Dear ma’am I dye for you.555What’s that,55 she said,55 O says Betty,A man ! and die for me !And can I see the youth expire—Oh, no 1 it must not be !Haste, Betty,—open quick the door:55‘Tis done; and, lo ! to view,A little man with bundle stood,In sleeves and apron blue.“ Ye Powers !55 cried Chloe,55 what is this?What5 vis'on do I see?Is this the man, oh, mighty Love ! —The man that dies for me?55“Yes, ma’am; your ladyship is right,55The figure straight replied;55 And hard for me it would have beenIf I had never dyed.La ! ma’am, you must have heard of me.Although I’m no highflyer;I live just by at No. 1,I’m Billy Dip, the dyer‘Twas I ma’am, Betty there employedTo dye your lustering gown;And I not only dye for you.But I dye for the whole town.55' -9TELI/S SPEECH.Ye crags and peaks, I’m with you once again !I hold to you the hands you first beheld,To show they still are free. Methinks I hearA spirit in your echoes answer me,And bid your tenant welcome to his homeAgain !—O sacred forms, how proud you look !How high you lift your heads into the sky !How huge you are ! how mighty and how free !Ye are the things that tower, that shine—whosesmileMakes glad—whose frown is terrible—whoseforms,Robed or unrobed, do all the impress wearOf awe divine. Ye guards of liberty,I‘m with you once again ! — I call to youWith all my voice !—I hold my hands to youTo shew they still are free, I rush to youAs though I could embrace you !Scaling yonder peak,I saw an eagle wheeling near its brow0‘er the abyss :— his broad-expanded wingsLay calm and motionless upo» the air,As if he floated there without their aid,By the sole act of his unlorded willThat buoy‘d him proudly up. InstinctivelyI bent my bow; yet kept he rounding stillHis airy circle, as in the delightOf measuring the ample range beneathAnd round about absorb’d, he heeded notThe death that threaten’d him.—I could notshoot;—‘Twas liberty !—I turned my bow aside,And let him soar away !Heavens, with what pride I usedTo walk these hills, and look up to my God,And bless him that it was so. It was free—From end to end, from cliff’to lake ‘twas free !Free as our torrents are that leap our rocks,And plougl our valleys, without asking leaveOr as our peaks that wear their caps of snow,In very presence of the regal sun.How happy was it then ! I lovedIts very storms. Yes, Emma, I have satIn my boat at night, when midway o’er the lakeThe stars went out, and down the mountain gorgeThe wind came roaring. I have sat and eyedThe thunder breaking from his cloud, and smiledTo see him shake his lightnings o'er my headAnd think I had no master save his own.You know the jutting cliff round which a trackUp hither winds, whose base is but the browTo such another one, with scanty roomFor two a-breast to pass? O’ertaken thereBy the mountain blast, I’ve laid me flat along,And while gust followed gust more fu iously.As if to sweep me o’er the horrid brink,And I have thought of other lands, whose stormsAre summer flaws to those of mine, and justHave wished me there—the thought that minewas freeHas check’d that wish, I have raised my head,And cried in thraldom to that furious wind,Blow on ! This is the land of liberty !THE COUNTY SCOOLMASTER.A Country Schoolmaster, high Jonas Bell,Once undertook of little souls,To furnish up their jobbernowls—In other words, he taught them how to spell,11And well adapted to the task was Bell,Whose iron visage measur’d half an ell:With huge proboscis, and eye-brows of sootArm’d at the jowl just like a boar,And when he, gave an angry roar,The little schoolboys stood like fishes mute.Poor Jonas, tho’ a patient n.an as Job,(Yet still, like Job, was sometimes heard to growlWas by a scholar’s adamantine nod,Beyond all patience gravell’d to the soul,I tjuestion whether Jonas in the FishDid ever diet on a bitterer dish.‘Twas thus—a lady who supported Bell,Came unexpectedly to hear them spell;The pupil fixed on by this pedagogue,Her son, a lit.le round fac’d4 ruddy rogueWho thus letters on the table laid—M. I. L. K,—and paused—“ Well, sir, whatthat?4444 I cannot tell,44 the boy all trembling said.—44 Not tell,44 you little blind and stupid brut444 Not tell,44 roar’d Jonas, in a violent rage,And quick prepared an angry war to wage.44 Tell me this instant, or I’ll flay thy hide-44 Come, Sir.44 Dost thou this birchen weapon see ?44 What puts thy mother in her tea ?44With lifted eyes the quaking rogue reply’d,“RUM, Sir • • • 44ALONZO THE BRAVE.A warrior so bold, and virgin so bright,Conven’d as they sat on the green ;12They gaz’d on each other with tender delight,Alonzo the Brave was the name of the knight.The maid was the Fair Imogine.And ah, “said the youth, “since to-morrow I goTo fight in a far distant land,Thy tears for my absence soon ceasing to flow,Some other will court you, and you will bestowOn a wealthier suitor your hand.“Oh, hush these suspicions,” fair Imogene saidSo hurtful to love and to me;Or if you be living, or if you be dead,I swear by the Virgin, that none in your steadShall husband of Imogene be.And, if e’er for another my heart should decide,Forgetting Alonzo the Brave,God grant, that to punish my falsehood and prideThy ghost at my marriage may sit by my side,May tax me with perjury, claim me as bride,And bear me away to the grave.”To Palestine hasten’d the warrior so bold,His love she lamented him sore;But scarce had a twelvemonth elaps’d when, be¬hold,A baron, all cover’d with jewels and gold,Arriv’d at fair Imogene’s door.His treasure, his presents, his spacious domain,Soon made her untrue to her vows,He dazzl’d her eyes, he bewilder’d her brain,He caught her affection, so light and so vain,And carried her home as his spouse.And now had the marriage been blest by thepriest,The revelry now was begun;The tables they groan’d with the weight of thefeast,Nor yet had-the laughter and merriment ceas’d,When the bell of the castle toll’d—One !«’Twas then, with amazement, fair Imogene foundA stranger was plac'd by her side;His air was terrific, he utter’d no sound,He spoke not, he mov’d not, he look’d not aroundBut earnestly gaz’d on the bride.His vizer was clos’d, and gigantic his height,His armour was sable to view;All laughter and pleasure were hush’d at his sightThe dogs as they ey’d him, drew back withaffright,And the lights in the chamber burnt blue.His presence all bosoms appear’d to dismay,The guests sat in silence and fear;At length, spoke the bride, while she trembled-*4I praySir Knight, that your helmet aside you would layAnd deign to partake of our cheer.The lady is silent—the stranger complies,And his viser he slowly unclos’d—O God, what a sight met Imogene’s eyes,What words can express her dismay and surpriseWhen a skeleton’s head was expos’d.All present then utter’d a terrified shout,And turn’d with disgust from the scene;14The worms they crept in, and the worms theycrept out,And sported his eyes and temples about,While the spectre address’d Imogene:“ Behold me, thou false one, behold me, “ hecried,“ Behold thy Alonzo the Brave,God grant that, to punish thy falsehood and prideMy ghost at thy marriage should sit by thy side,Should tax thee with perjury, claim thee as brideAnd bear thee away to thee grave.“This saying, his arms round the lady he wound,\\ hile fair Imogene shriek’d with dismay;Then sunk with his prey through the wide-yawn¬ing ground,Nor never again was Fair Imogene found,Or the spectre that bore her away.Not long liv’d the baron, and none, since thattime,To inhabit the castle presume;For chronicles tell, that by order sublime.There Imogene suffers the pain ot her crime,And mourns her deplorable doom.At midnight four times in each year does hersprite,When mortals in slumber are bound,Array’d in her bridal apparel of white,Appear in the hall with her skeleton knight,And shrieks as he whirls her around.While they drink out of sculls newly tern fromthe grave,Dancing round them pale spectres are seen:15Their liquor is blood, and this horrible staveThey howl,“ To the health of Alonzo the BraveAnd his consort the false Imogene.“THE OLD MAN, HIS SON AND ASS.A country fellow and his son, they tellIn modern fables, had an ass to sell:For this intent they turn’d, it out to play,And fed so well that by the destin’d day,They brought the creature into sleek repair,And drove it gently to a neighb’ring fair.As they were jogging on, a rural classWas heard to say, “ Look, look there at that assAnd those two blockheads trudging on each sideThat have not either of ‘em sense to ride:Asses all three and thus the country folksOn man and boy began to cut their jokes.Th‘ old fellow minded nothing that they said,But every word stuck in the young one’s head ;And they began their comment there upon‘Ne’er heed ‘em lad,“ “ Nay, father, do get on.‘,‘ Not I, indeed.“ “ Why then, let me, pray,“‘ Well do: and see what prating tongues will sayThe boy was mounted; and they had not gotMuch further on, before another knot,Just as the ass passing by, pad, pad,Cried, “O ! that lazy looby of a lad,How unconcernedly the gaping bruteLets the poor aged fellow walk a foot.”Down came the son, on hearing this account,And begg’d and pray’d, and made his fathermount:■A16Till a third party on a farther stretch,“See ! see !” exclaim’d,“ that old hard-heartedwretch 1How like a justice there he sits, or squire,While the poor lad keepswadin through the mire”“ Stop,” cried the lad, still deeper rex’d inmind“ Stop lather; stop let me get on behind.“This done, the thought they certainly shouldplease,Escape reproaches, and be both at ease;For having tried each practicable way,What could be left for jokers now to say ?Still disappointed by succeeding tone.“ Hark ye, you fellow ‘ Is that ass your own ?Get off, for shame, or one of you at least;You both deserve to carry the poor beast;Ready to drop down upon the road,With such a huge unconscionable load,'On this they both dismounted ; and,.some sayContriv’d to carry, the remaining wayThe ass between em; prints are seen, they add,The ass supported by the man and lad,Others omit that fancy in the print,As overstraining an ingenious hint.The copy that we follow, says, the manRubb'd down his ass, and took to his first plan ;Walk'll to the fair and sold him, got his price,And gave his son this pertinent advice“ Let talkers talk ; stick thou to what is best;To think of pleasing all, is all a jest.’4ON THE DOWNFALL OF POLAND.O sacred Truth, thy triumph ceased a-while.And hope, thy sister, ceased wit!) thee to smileWhen leagued Oppression poured to NorthernwarsHer whiskerer pandours and fierce hussars,Waved her dread standard to the breeze of mornPealed her loud drum, and twanged her trumpethorn;Tumultuous horror brooded o'er her van,Presaging wrath to Poland—and to man ;Warsaw's last champion, from her height sur¬vey'dWide o'er the fields a waste of ruin laid,—‘O Heavens,' he cried, ‘my bleeding countrysave,'Is there no hand on high to shield the brave ?Yet, though destruction sweeps these lovely plainsRise, fellow men, our country yet remains,By that dread name, we wave the sword on high,And swear for her to live—with her to die;"He said, and on the rampart heights arrayedHis trusty warriors, few, but undismay'd :Firm paced and slow, a horrid front they form,Still as the breeze, but dreadful as the storm.Low, murmuring sound along their banner fly.Revenge or death.— The watchword and replyThen pealed the notes, omnipotent to charm.And the loud tocsin tolled their last alarm.In vain—alas, in vain ye gallant few,From rank to rank your voided thunder flew ;O, bloodiest picture in the book of time,Samartia fell, unwept, without a crime.13Found not a generous friend, a prtying foe,Strength in her arms, nor mercy in her woe,Dropt from her nerveless grasp theshutterd spearClosed her bright eye, and embed her high car¬eer;Hope, for a season, bad the world farewell,And freedom shrieked—as Kosciusko fell.The sun went down, nor ceased the carnagethere,Tumultuous murder shook the midnight air—On Prague's proud arch the fires of ruin glow—H is blood-dyed waters murmuring far below,The storm prevails, the ramparts yeilds away—Bursts the wild cry of horror and dismay.Hark, as the mouldering piles with thunder fall,A thousand shrieks for hopeless mercy call:Earth shook — red meteors flash along the sky,And conscious nature shuddered at the cry.O righteous Heaven, ere Freedom found agrave,Why slept the sword, omnipotent to save,Where was thine arm, O Vengeance, where thyrod,That smote the foes of Zion and of God ?That crushed proud Ammon, when his iron carWas yoked in wrath, and thundered from afar ?Where was the storm that slumbered till the hostOf blood stained Pharaoh left their tremblingcoast,Then bade the deep in wild commotion flowAnd heaved on ocean on their march below?Departed spirits of the Mighty dead,Ye that at Marrthon and Leucra bled,Friends of the world, restore jour swords to manFight in his sacred cause, and lead the van ;Yet for Samatia‘s tears of blood atone,And make her arm puissant as your own.Oh, once again to Freedoms cause return,The Patriot Tell—the Bruce of Bannockburn.PARODY ON ‘LORD ULLIN's DAUGHTER.A weaver, unto Paisley bound,Cries ‘ Coachman, coachman tarry,And I will gi‘e you eighteenpence,Me on the road to carry.4Now wha be ye the road wad pass,This dreadfu‘*snawy weather ?4 Oh !

Come, darling, take a little toddy,It is a cold and rainy day;A little’s good for any body;Come, take a little, child, I pray.Child. O father, do not tempt me so,I fear I'll love it by and by,And then my love will grow and grow,Till I shall drink your bottle dry.23Falhwr. Fie, fie, that uncle Charles, I thiHic,Has turned you silly quit, and wild:Would your dear father tell you drinkIf this would hurt his darling child?Child. Father, I love you from my heart.But O, I fear to taste your brandy;The sugared dram shall be your partAnd I will have my sugar candy.O, father ! tell me what‘s the matterAt Mr. Toper‘s house, just by ;O see the little children scatter,And hear their mother shriek and cry !Father. Why, child, that lazy drunken hogHas just come home to beat his wife;The brute is now so f ull of grog,That all must run to save their life.Child. And yet when he was young, they say,Fie was as good as any body ;But every cold or rainy day,His father gave the darling toddy.Father, if he had never tasted,Would he have been a drunkard now?His credit gone, his money wasted,Flis wife and children sunk in woe ?Father. But ah, my child, he drank too deep,He should have stopped at moderation:If we in proper limits keep,There is no danger in creation.Child. And, father, I may drink too deep,It I should drink your sweetened grog,And, oh ! how would my father weepTo hear them call me “ drunken hog|!”24And father, don't the Bible say,No drunkards shall with Jesus dewll?That God will send them far away,To sigh and weep in deepest hell ?I love you, father, that you know—O do not spoil your darling son; —But should I drink and sink to woe,I‘ll say my father urged me on.Father. Enough, my son, I’ve no desireTo urge you on to woe and pain ;I{11 throw my toddy in the fire,And never taste myself again.My child has rescued me from shame,And filled his father's heart with joy;Sure I had gained a drunkard's graveBut for this precious darling boy.Another drop I will not covet;(James, break that filthy demi-john ;For when a man begins to love it,He is already half undone.

”“ It is your first love, sweet Willie,This night newly come hame.”“ I ha’e few lovers thereout, thereout.As few ha’e I therein ;The best an’ love that ever I had,Was here just late yestreen.”“ The warstan stable in a’ your stables,For my puir steed to stand ;The warstan bower in a’ your bowers,For me to lie therein:My boots are fu’ o’ Clyde’s water,I’m shivering at the chin.”7“ My barns are fu’ o’ corn, Willie,My stables are fu’ o’ hay ;My bowers are fu’ o’ gentlemen,They’ll nae remove till day.”“ 0 fare-ye-well, my fause Meggie,0 farewell, and adieu ;I’ve gotten my mither’s malison,This night coming to you.”As he rode ower yon high, high hill,And down yon dowie den ;The rushing that was in Clyde’s water.Took Willie’s cane frae him.He lean’d him ower his saddle bow,To catch his cane again ;The rushing that was in Clyde’s water.Took Willie’s hat frae him.He lean’d him o’er his saddle bow,To catch his hat through force ;The rushing that was in Clyde’s water,Took Willie frae his horse.His brither stood upo’ the bank,Says, “ Fye, man, will ye drown?Ye’ll turn ye to your high horse head.And learn how to sowm.”“ How can I turn to my horse head.And learn how to sowm ?I’ve gotten my mither’s malison.It’s here that I maun drown!”The very hour this young man sankInto the pot sae deep.8Up waken’d his love, Meggie,Out o' her drowsy sleep.“ Come here, come here, my mither dear,And read this dreary dream;I dream’d my love was at our yates,And nane wad let him in.”“ Lye still, lyA still now, my Meggie,Lye still and tak’ your rest;Sin your true love was at our yates.It’s but twa quarters past.”Nimbly, nimbly, raise she up.And nimbly pat she on ;And the higher that the lady cried.The louder blew the win’.The first an’ step that she stepp’d in.She stepped to the queet:“ Ohon, alas!” said that lady,“ This water’s wondrous deep.”The next an’ step that she wade in,She wadit to the knee ;Says she, “ I could wade farther in.If I my love could see.”The next an’ step that she wade in,She wadit to the chin ;The deepest pot in Clyde’s waterShe got sweet Willie in.“You’ve had a cruel mither, Willie,And I have had anither;But we shall sleep in Clyde’s water,Like sister an’ like brither.”

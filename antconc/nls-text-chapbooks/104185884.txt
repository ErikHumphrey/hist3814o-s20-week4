Leaving this country, they came to theenchanted ground, where they fell in with someof the shining inhabitants, ot the City17Christian and Hopeful drawing nigh to theCelistial City, beheld the streets were paved withpure gold, but there was a very deep river throughwhich they must pass the Pilgrims were alarmedand begun to sink ; but rose again and were wel¬comed on the other side by two glorious personsW18IChristian's wife and children wept for him,until a heavenly messenger gave her a letter tofollow her husband, and live with him for ever.At first she was overcome, hut taking the roadwith all her children they fell in with Mercy, andwent toward the wicket gate.§sA| After they had got safely through the SloughM Despond, they arrived at the gate, where theyilknocked a long time, till at length the keepertailed out “ Who’s there,” and opened the gate,>innd taking Christiana by the hand welcomed them{jiaying “ Suffer little children to come unto me.”20With some difficulty Mercy was admitted, andthey safely arrived at Interpreter’s house; sup¬per being ready, and thanks given, they paitookof a hearty repast; Interpreter asked how shebecame a pilgrim, she said, it wTas by the loss ofher husband, and a letter from the King of Zion-.21In the morning they were much refreshed.Greatheart was sent along with them to guidethem on their way. They passed the placewhere the load fell from Christian’s back; andcame to the place where Simple, Sloth, and Pre¬sumption were hanging in chains.They soon arrived at the Hill of Difficulty ;Greatheart shewed them the spring- where Christ¬ian drank; they then begun to ascend the hill, butChristiana began to pant and want rest; butGreatheart encouraged them, telling them theywere near the Arbour, where they would find rest.Being refreshed at the Arbour, and approach-ng Doubting Castle, Greatheart determined tolevel it with the ground. He and the giant had aevere fight, hut the giant was overcome. Theyhen demolished the Castle, and released manyirisoners, where many strung sights were seen.21They still persevered on in their journey by /tile straight way, and narrow path of pilgrims;,occasionally meeting with difficulties arid encour¬agement, till they arrived at the land of Beulah,where the sun shines night and day ; and herethey betook themselves to rest.Now while they lay here there was a post camfrom the Celestial City, with a letter to Christianna: the contents were “ Hail good womanI bring thee good tidings that the master calledfor thee,* and expecteth that thou shouldst staiuin his presence within these ten days.”Now the day drew on that Christiana must begone. So the road was full of people to see hertake her journey. So she came forth and enter¬ed the river with a beckon ot farewell to thosthat follow her to the river side. The last word',she was heard to say, were, “ I come, Lord, tobe wit!#thee, and bless thee.”So her children and friends returned to theirplace; for those that waited for Christiana hadcarried her out of their sight. So she went andcalled and entered in at the gate with all theceremonies of Joy that Christian had done be-|fore her.unis.

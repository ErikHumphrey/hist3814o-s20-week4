For there was ne’er a champion yet,S' In Scotland or in France,That ever did on horseback come,• But if my hap it were,[ I durst encounter man for man,With him to break a spear.Lord Douglas on a milk-white steed.Most like a Baron bold,[ Rode foremost of his company.His armour shone like gold,i Shew me, said he, whose men ye be.That hunt so boldly here ;: That without my consent do chaseAnd kill my fallow deer.The first man that did answer makeWas noble Percy he.Who said, we list not to declareNor show whose men we be;Yet we will spend our dearest blood.The choicest harts to slay.Then Douglas swore a solemn oath,And thus in rage did say—E’er thus I will outbraved be.One of us two shall die.I know thee well, an Earl thou art—Lord Percy—so am I:But trust me, Percy, pity it were,And great offence to killAny of these our harmless men.For they have done no ill.Let thee and me the battle try.And set our men aside;Accurs’d be he, said Earl Percy,By whom this is denied.Then slept a gallant squire forth,Witherington by name;Who said he would not have it toldTo Henry his king for shame—That e’er my captain fought on foot.And I stood looking on.Ye be two Earls, said Witherington,And I a ’squire alone,I’ll do the best that I may do,Whilst I have power to stand—Whilst I have powrer to wield my sword.I’ll fight with heart and hand.Our Scottish archers bent their bows,Their hearts were good and true;At the first flight of arrows sent,They fourscore English slew.To drive the deer with hound and horn,Douglas bade on the bent.A captain mov d with meikle pride.The spears in shivers went.They closed full fast on every side.No slackness there was found.And many a gallant gentlemanLay gasping on the ground.0 ! but it was a grief to see.And likewise for to hear.The cries of men lying in their gore.All scattered here and there.At last these two Earls did meet,Like chieftains of great might;Like lions mov'd, they fear’d no lord.They made a crueffight,They fought until they both did sweat.With swords of temper’d steel Until the blood like drops of rain,They trickling down did feel,ield thee, Percy, Douglas said,In faith I will thee bringWhere thou shall high advanced be.By James our Scottish King;Thy ransom I will freely give,^ And this report of thee—1 hou art the most courageous knightThat ever I did see.Nay, Douglas, quoth Lord Percy then,.Thy proffer I do scorn;I will not yield to any ScotThat ever yet was born.With that there came an arrow keen.Out of the English bow,Which struck Lord Douglas to the heart,A deep and deadly blow—6Who never spoke more words than these.Fight on my merry men all—For why, my life is at an end,Lord Percy sees me fall.Then leaving off, Lord Percy tookThe dead man by the hand.And said, Lord Douglas, for thy lifeI would have lost my land;O ! but my very heart doth bleedWith sorrow for thy sake,For sure a more renowned knightMischance did never take.A knight among the Scots there was,Who saw Earl Douglas die,Who straight in wrath did vow revengeUpon the Earl Percy.Sir Hugh Montgomery he was call'd,Who with a spear full bright,Well mounted on a gallant steed.Rode fiercely through the fight.He pass’d the English archers all,Without e'er dread or fear,And through Earl Percy’s body thenHe thrust his hateful spear.With a vehement force and mightHe did his body gore—The spear went through the other side,A long cloth yard and more.So thus did these two nobles die,Whose courage none could stain.An English archer then perceivedHis noble lord was slain,lie had a bow bent in his hand,Made of a trusty tree,7An arrow of a cloth yard's length,Unto the head he drew—Against Sir Hugh Montgomery thenSo right his shaft he set,The grey goose wings that were thereinIn his heart’s blood were wet.The fight did last from break of daytill setting of the sun ;For when they rung the evening bell.The battle scarce was done.With the Earl Percy there was slain—Sir John of Qgerton ;Sir Robert Ratcliffe and Sir John,Sir James the bold baron :Sir George and also good Sir Hugh,Both knights of good account;Good Sir Ralph Raby there was slain.Whose powers did surmount;For Witherington I needs must wail.As one in woeful dumps—For when his legs were smitten off.He fought upon his stumps.And with Earl Douglas there was slain—Sir Hugh Montgomery;Sir Charles Murray that from the fieldOne foot would never fly ;Sir Charles Murray of Ratcliffe tooHis sister’s son was he :Sir David Lamb so well esteemed.Yet saved could he not be ;And Lord Maxwell e’en likewise.Did with Earl Douglas die.Of fifteen hundred Scottish men.Went home but fifty-three;3Of twenty hundred Englishmen,Scarce fifty-five did flee ;The rest were slain at Chevy-chase.Under the green-wood tree.Next day did many widows comeTheir husbands to bewails—They washed their wounds with brinished tears,But all could not prevail.Their bodies bathed in purple blood,They carried them away;They kissed them dead a thousand times.When they were cold as clay.The news were brought to Edinburgh,Where Scotland's king did reign,That brave Earl Douglas suddenly,Was by an arrow slain.Now God be with him, said the king,Sith ’twill no better be—1 trust I have in my realmFive hundred good as he.Like tidings to king Henry came.Within as short a space,That Percy of Northumberland,Was slain at Chevy-chase.0 heavy news, king Henry said,England can witness be—1 have not any captain moreOf such account as he.Now of the rest of small account,Did many .hundreds die;Thus ends the battle of Chevy-chase,Made by the Earl Percy .;

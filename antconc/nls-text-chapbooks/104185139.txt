na, na, na, ye needna mourn.My een are dim and drowsy worn;Ye bonny birds ye needna sing,For Luman never can return.My Lumah’s love, in broken sighs,At dawn of day by Doun ye’se hear,And mid-day, by the willow green,For him I’ll shed a stlent tear.gweet birds, I ken ye’ll pity me,And join me wi’ a plantive sang,While echo wakes, arid joins the maneI mak for him I lo’ed sac lang.

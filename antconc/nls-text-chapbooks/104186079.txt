I will acquaint themwith the true secret of money-catching—the certain way tofill empty purses—and how to keep them always full. Twosimple rules, well observed, will do the business:—First, Leti honesty and industry be thy constant companions; and,secondly, spend one penny less than thy clear gains. Thenshall thy hide-bound pocket soon begin to thrive, and willnever again cry with the empty belly-ache; neither willCreditors insult, nor want oppress thee, nor hunger bite, nornakedness freeze thee. The whole hemisphere will shinebrighter, and pleasure spring up in every corner of thy heart.Now, therefore, embrace these rules and be happy. Banishthe bleak winds of sorrow from thy mind, and live indepen¬dent. Then shalt thou be a man, and not hide thy face at theapproach of the rich, nor suffer the pain of feeling little whenthe sons of fortune walk at thy right hand ; for independency,whether with little or much, is good fortune, and placeth theeon even ground with the proudest of the golden fleece. Oh,then, be wise, and let industry walk with thee in the morning,and attend thee until thou readiest the evening hour for rest.Let honesty be as the breath of thy soul, and never forget tohave a penny, when all thy expenses are enumerated and paid ;then shalt thou reach the point of happiness, and indepen¬dence shall be thy shield and buckler, thy helmet and crown ;then shall thy soul walk upright, nor stoop to the silken wretchbecause he hath riches, nor pocket an abuse because the handwhich offers it wears a ring set with diamonds.iADVICE TO A YOUNG TRADESMAN.Remember that time is money. He that can earn 10s. a- Iilay by his labour, and goes abroad, or sits idle one half of 1that day, though he spends but 6d. during his diversion or pidleness, ought not to reckon that the only expense; he has Ereally spent, or rather thrown away, 5s. besides.Remember that credit is money. If a man lets his money flie in my hands after it is due, he gives me the interest, or so tmuch as I can make of it during that time. This amounts |to a considerable sum where a man has good and large credit, Land makes good use of it.Remember that money is of a prolific generating nature. |Money can beget money, and its offspring can beget more, and ;so on :—5s. turned is 6s.; turned again it is 7s. 3d.; and so ontill it becomes £100. The more there is of it the more it pro- ■duces every turning, so that the profits rise quicker and ;quicker. He that kills a breeding sow, destroys all her off¬spring to the thousandth generation. He that murders a .crown, destroys all that it might have produced, even scores jof pounds.Remember that £6 a-year is but a groat a-day. For this ■little sum, (which may be daily wasted either in time or Iexpense, unperceived,) a man of credit may on his own seen- Irity, have the constant possession and use of £100. So much 1in stock, briskly turned by an industrious man, produces great |advantage.Remember this saying,—“ The good paymaster is lord of 'another man’s purse.” He that is known to pay punctuallyand exactly to the time he promises, may at anytime, and on Iany occasion, raise all the money his friends can spare. This |is sometimes of great use. After industry and frugality, |nothing contributes more to the raising of ayoungman in the !world, than punctuality and justice in all his dealings ; there- jfore, never keep borrowed money an hour beyond the time Iyou promised, lest a disappointment shut up your friend’s Ipurse for ever.The most trifling actions that affect a man’s credit are to beregarded. The sound of your hammer at five in the morning !or nine at night, heard by a creditor, makes him easy sixmonths longer; but if he sees you at a billiard table, or hearsyour voice at a tavern, when you should be at work, he sendsfor his money the next day; demands it before he can receiveit in a lump.It shows, besides, that you are mindful of what you owe ; 19it makes you appear a careful as well as an honest man, andthat still increases your credit.Beware of thinking all your own that you possess, and ofliving accordingly. It is a mistake that many people whohave credit fall into. To prevent this, keep an exact account,for some time, both of your expenses and your income. Ityou take the pains at first to mention particulars, it will havethis good effect, you will discover how wonderfully smalltrifling expenses mount up to large sums, and will discernwhat might have been, and may for the future be saved, with¬out occasioning any great inconvenience.In short, the way to wealth, if you desire it, is as plain asthe way to-market. It depends chiefly on two words, industry\ smOl frugality; that is, waste neither time nor money, but makethe best use of both. Without industry and frugality nothing| will do, and with them every thing. He that gets all he can} honestly, and saves all he gets, (necessary expenses excepted,)1 will certainly become rieh—if that Being who governs thei w'orld, to whom all should look for a blessing on their honestendeavours doth not, in his wise providence, otherwise deter-1 mine.Ax Old Tradesman.1748.NECESSARY HINTS TO THOSE THAT WOULDBE RICH.The use of money is all the advantage there is in havingmoney.For £6 a-year you may have the use of £100, provided youare a man of known prudence and honesty.He that spends a groat a-day idly, spends idly above £Ga-year, which is the price for the use of £100.He that wastes idly a groat’s worth of his time per day, oneday with another, wastes the privilege of using £100 each day.He that idly loses 5s. worth of time loses 5s., and might asprudently throw 5s. into the sea.He that loses 5s., not only loses that sum, but all the ad¬vantages that might be made by turning it in dealing; which,by the time that a young man becomes old, will amount to aconsiderable sum of money.Again, he that sells upon credit, asks a price for what hesells, equivalent to the principal and interest of his money forthe time he is to be kept out of it; therefore, he that buysupon credit, pays interest for what he buys ; and he that pays6ready money, might let that money out to use; so that hethat possesses any thing he has bought, pays interest for theuse of it.Yet, in buying goods, it is best to pay ready money, becausehe that sells upon credit, expects to lose five per cent, by baddebts; therefore he charges, on all he sells upon credit, anadvance that shall make up that deficiency.Those who pay for what they buy upon credit, pay theirshare of this advance.He that pays ready money, escapes, or may escape, thatcharge.A penny saved is twopence clear;A pin a-day’s a groat a-ycar.PRELIMINARY ADDRESS to the PENNSYLVANIAALMANAC,ENTITUtED,“Poor Richard’s Almanack for the Year 1758.”I have heard that nothing gives an author so great pleasureas to find his works respectfully quoted by other learnedauthors. This pleasure I have seldom enjoyed; for though Ihave been, if I may say it without vanity, an eminent author(of Almanacks) annually, now a full quarter of a century, mybrother authors in the same way (for what reason I know not,)have ever been very sparing in their applauses ; and no otherauthor has taken the least notice of me ; so that, did not mywritings produce me some solid pudding, the great deficiencyof praise would have quite discouraged me.I concluded at length, that the people were the best judgesof my merit, for they buy my works; and besides, in myrambles, where I am not personally known, I have frequentlyheard one or other of my adages repeated with—“ As poor Richard says,”at the end on’t. This gave me some satisfaction ; as it showednot only that my instructions were regarded, but discovered ;and I own, that, to encourage the practice of rememberingand repeating those wise sentences, I have sometimes quotedmyself with great gravity.Judge, then, how much I must have been gratified by anincident I am going to relate to you.7I stopped my horse lately, where a great number of peoplewere collected at an Auction of Merchant Goods. The houri of sale not being come, they were conversing on the badnesslof the times, and one of the company called to a plain, clean,I old man, with white locks, “Pray, father Abraham, whatthink you of the times ? Won’t these heavy taxes quite ruinthe country ? How shall we ever be able to pay them ? What' would you advise us to do ?” Father Abraham stood up and: replied, “ If you’d have my advice, I’ll give it to you in short;: ‘ for a word to the wise is enough ; and many words won’t filla bushel,’ as poor Richard says.” They jdined in desiringhim to speak his mind ; and gathering round him he proceededI as follows :—Friends, says he, and neighbours, the taxes are indeed veryi heavy ; and if those laid on by the government were the onlyi ones we had to pay, we might more easily discharge them ;|i but we have many others, and much more grievous to someii of us. We are taxed twice as much by our idleness, threetimes as much by our pride, and four times as much by our>' folly ; and from these taxes the commissioner cannot ease orf deliver us by allowing an abatement. However, let us hearken: to good advice, and something may be done for us:—“ God helps them that helps themselves,”i as poor Richard says in his almanack.It would be thought a hard government that should tax its| people one-tenth part of their time, to be employed in its ser-i vice ; but idleness taxes many of us much more, if we reckoni all that is spent in absolute sloth, or doing of nothing, withI that which is spent in idle employments, or amusements thatamount to nothing.“ Sloth, by bringing on disease, absolutely shortens life.”“ Sloth, like rust, consumes faster than labour wears, whilethe key used is always bright,” as poor Richard says.Rut dost thou love life? then do not squander time, for“that’s the stuff life is made of,” as poor Richard says. Howmuch more than is necessary do wre spend in sleep ! forgettingj that “ the sleeping fox catches no poultry, and that there willbe sleeping enough in the grave,” as poor Richard says. “Iftime be of all things the most precious, wasting time must be(as poor Richard says) the greatest prodigality since, as heelsewhere tells, “ Lost time is never found again ; and whatwe call time enough, always proves little enough.”Let us then up and be doing, and doing to the purpose; soby diligence shall we do more with less perplexity. “ Slothmakes all things difficult, but industry all easy,” as pooRichard says; and, “ he that riseth late must trot all day, amshall scarce overtake his business at night; while lazinps.travels so slowly that poverty soon overtakes him,” as wread in poor Richard ; who adds, “ Drive thy business : le'not that drive thee,” and,“ Early to bed, and early to rise,Makes a man healthy, -wealthy, and wise.”So what signifies wishing and hoping for better times ? IVcmake these times better if we bestir ourselves. “ Industnneeds not wish,” as poor Richard says ; and,“He that lives upon hope will die fasting.”“ There are no gains without pains; then help hands, for Ihave no lands, or if I have, they are smartly taxed and, (aspoor Richard likewise observes,) “ He that hath a trade hathan estate ; and he that hath a calling hath an office of profitand honour ; but then the trade must be worked at, and thecalling well followed, or neither the estate nor the office willenable us to pay our taxes.”If we are industrious, we shall never starve; for, as poor.Richard says, “ At the working man’s house hunger looks in,but dares not enter.” Nor will the bailiff or the constableenter; for, “Industry pays debts, while despair increaseththem,” says poor Richard. What though you have found notreasure, nor has any rich relation left you a legacy. “ Dili¬gence is the mother of good luck,” as poor Richard says ; and,“ God gives all things to industry ;”“ Then plough deep while sluggards sleep,And you will have corn to sell and to keep,”says poor Dick.Work while it is called to-day; for you know not how muchyou may be hindered to-morrow; which makes poor Richardsay, “One to-day is worth two to-morrows,” and further,“Have you somewhat to do to-morrow, do it to-day.” If youwere a servant, would you not be ashamed that a good mastershould catch you idle ? Are you then your own master ? beashamed to catch yourself idle, as poor Dick says.When there is so much to be done for yourself, your family,your country, and your gracious king, be up by peep of daylet not the sun look down, and say,“ Inglorious here he lies !91 Handle youv tools without mittens; remember that “ the cat■i in gloves catches no mice,” as poor Richard says.It is true there is much to be done, and perhaps you arcI weak handed ; but stick to it steadily and you will see great) effects; for, “ constant dropping wears away stones, and byi diligence and patience the mouse ate into the cable ; and lighti strokes fell great oaks,” as poor Richard says in his Almanack,' the year I cannot just now remember.Methinks I hear some of you say, “ Must a man afford him-i self no leisure?”—I will tell thee, my friend, what poorI Richard says:—“ Employ thy time well, if thou meanest to; gain leisure; and since thou art not sure of a minute, throw1 not away an hour.” Leisure is time for doing somethinguseful; this leisure the diligent man will obtain, but the lazy.] man never ; so that, as poor Richard says, “ A life of leisure. and a life of laziness are two things.”Do you imagine that sloth will afford you more comfortthan labour ? No ; for, as poor Richard says, “ Troubles\ spring from idleness, and grievous toil from needless ease.”Many without labour would live by their own wits only ; butthey break for want of stock; “ Whereas industry gives com-! fort, and plenty, and respect.” “Ely pleasures, and they’llfollow you; the diligent spinner has a large shift; and now Ij have a large shift; and now I have a sheep and a cow, everybody bids me good morrow all which is well said by poorRichard.But, with our industry, we must likewise be steady, settled,and careful, and oversee our own affairs with our own eyes,I and never trust too much to others ; for, as poor Richard says,“ I never saw an oft removed tree,Nor yet an oft removed family,That throve so well as those that settled be.”And again, “Three removes are as bad as a fire;” andagain, “ Keep thy shop, and thy shop will keep thee;” andagain, “If you would have your business done, go ; if not,send.” And again,“ He that by the plough would thrive,Himself must either hold or drive.”And again, “ The eye of a master will do more work thanboth his hands;” and again, “ Want of care does us moredamage than want of knowledge ;” and again, “Not to over¬see workmen is to leave them your purse open.”Trusting too much to others’ care is the ruiu cf many ; for,as the Almanack says, “In the affairs of the world, men are210saved not by faith, but by the Want of itbut a man’s owncare is profitable ; for, saith poor Dick, “ Learning is to thestudious, and riches to the careful, as well as power to thebold, and heaven to the virtuous.”And further, “ If you would haVe a faithful servant, andone that you like, serve yourself.” And again, he adviseth tocircumspection and care even in the smallest matters ; be¬cause, sometimes, “A little neglect may breed great mischief;”adding, “ For want of a nail the shoe was lost; for want of ashoe the horse was lost; and for want of a horse the riderwas lost;” being overtaken and slain by the enemy, all forw'ant of care about a horse shoe nail.So much for industry, my friends, and attention to one’sown business ; but to these wre must add frugality, if we would !make our industry more certainly successful.A man may, if he knows not how to save as he gets, “ keephis nose all his life to the grindstone, and die not worth a groatat last.” “ A fat kitten makes a lean will,” as poor Richardsays ; and,“ Many estates are spent in the getting;Since women for tea forsook spinning and knitting,And men for punch forsook hewing and splitting.”“ If you would be wealthy, (says he, in another Almanack,) 'think of saving, as well as of getting. The Indians have notmade Spain rich, because her outgoes are greater than herincomes.”Away, then, with your expensive follies, and you will nothave much cause to complain of hard times, heavy taxes, andchargeable families ; for, as poor Dick says,“ Women and wine, game and deceit,Make the wealth small, and the wants great.”And further, “ What maintains one vice would bring up twochildren.” You may think, perhaps, that a little punch, nowand then, diet a little more costly, clothes a little finer, and alittle entertainment now and then, can be no great matter;but remember what poor Richard says, “ Many a little makesa meikle and further, “ Beware of little expenses ; a smallleak will sink a great ship ;” and again, “ Who dainties loveshall beggars prove and moreover,“Fools make feasts, and wise men eat them.”Here you are all got together at this sale of fineries andnick-nacks. You call them GOODS ; but if you do not takecare, they will prove EVILS to some of you. You expect11] they will be sold cheap, and perhaps they may, for less thanI they cost ; but, if you have no occasion for them, they mustI be dear to you. Kemember what poor Richard says, “ Buy1 what thou hast no need of, and ere long thou shalt sell thyil necessaries.” And again, “At a great penny-worth pauseti awhile.” He means, that perhaps the cheapness is apparentii only, but not real; or the bargain, by straitening thee in thyI business, may do thee more harm than good. Borin another' place he says,“ Many have been ruined by buying good pennyworths.”Again, poor Richard says, “ It is foolish to lay out moneyin a purchase of repentance;’’ and yet this folly is practisedevery day at auctions, for want of minding the Almanack.I “ Wise men (as poor Dick says,) learn by others harms; foolsscarcely by their own.’ ’ Many a one for the sake of finery on1 the back, have gone with a hungry belly, and have starvedtheir families.“ Silks and satins, scarlets and velvets, (as poor Richardsays,) put out the kitchen fire.” These are not the neces¬saries of life—they can scarcely be called the conveniences ;and yet, only because they look pretty, how many want tohave them ? The artificial wants of mankind thus becomemore numerous than the natural; and, as poor Richard says,“For one poor person there are a hundred indigent.”By these and other extravagances, the genteel are reducedto poverty, and forced to borrow of those whom they formerlydespised, but who, through industry and frugality, have main¬tained their standing ; in which case it appears plainly that“ a ploughman on his legs is higher than a gentleman on hisknees,” as poor Richard says. Perhaps they have had a smallestate left them, which they knew not the getting of; they think“ it is day, and will never be nightthat a little to be spentout of so much is not worth minding: “ A child and a fool(as poor Richard says,) imagine twenty shillings and twentyyears can never be spent; but always taking out of the meal-tub, and never putting in, soon comes to the bottom then,as poor Dick says, “ When the well is dry, they know theworth of water.” But this they might have known before,if they had taken his advice.“If you would know the value of money, go and try to bor¬row some; for he that goes a borrowing goes a sorrowing,”as poor Richard says; and indeed so does he that lends tosuch people, when he goes to get it in again.Poor Dick further advises, and says,12" Fond pride of dress is sure a very curse,Ere Fancy you consult, consult your purse.”And again, “Pride is as loud a beggar as want, and a greatdeal more saucy.” When you have bought one fine thingyou must buy ten more, that your appearance may be all of apiece ; but poor Dick says, “ It is easier to suppress the firstdesire than to satisfy all that follow itand it is as truly follyfor the poor to ape the rich, as the frog to swell, in order toequal the ox.“Vessels large may venture more,But little boats should keep near shore.”'Tis, however, a folly soon punished ; for “Pride that dineson vanity sups on contempt,” as poor Bichard says. And inanother place,“ Pride breakfasted with Plenty,Dined with Poverty,And supped with Infamy.”And, after all, of what use is this pride of appearance, forwhich so much is risked, so much is suffered ? It cannot pro¬mote health, nor ease pain ; it makes no increase of merit inthe person ; it creates envy; it hastens misfortune.“ What is a butterfly? at bestHe’s but a caterpillar drest;The gaudy fop’s his picture justas poor Kichard says.But what madness must it be to run in debt for thosesuperfluities 1 We are offered by the terms of this sale, sixmonths credit; and that, perhaps, has induced some of us toattend it, because we cannot spare the ready money, and hopenow to be fine without it. But ah ! think what you do whenyou run in debt; you give to another power over your liberty.If you cannot pay at the time, you will be ashamed to seeyour creditor, you will be in fear when you speak to him, youwill make poor, pitiful, sneaking excuses, and, by degrees,come to lose your veracity, and sink into base, downrightlying ; for, as poor Kichard says, “ The second vice is lying ;the first is running in debt.”And again to the same purpose, “ Lying rides upon debt’sback;” whereas a free-born Briton ought not to be ashamednor afraid to see or speak to any man living. But povertyoften deprives a man of all spirit and virtue. “ It is hard foran empty bag to stand upright,” as poor Eichard truly says.13What would you think of that prince, or of that govern-: ment, who should issue an edict forbidding you to dress likea gentleman or gentlewoman, on pain of imprisonment orI servitude ? Would you not say, that you were free, have aright to dress as you please, and that such an edict would bea breach of your privileges, and such a government tyranni¬cal? And yet, you are about to put yourself under thattyranny, when you run in debt for such dress! Your creditorhas authority, at his pleasure, to deprive you of your liberty,by confining you in jail for life, or by selling you for a servant,if you should not be able to pay him.When you have got your bargain, you may, perhaps, thinklittle of payment; but “Creditors (poor Richard tells us,)have better memories than debtors;” and in another place,he says, “ Creditors are a superstitious set, great observers ofset days and times.”The day comes round before you are aware, and the demandis made before you are prepared to satisfy it; or, if you bearyour debt in mind, the term which at first seemed so long,will, as it lessens, appear extremely short; time will seem tohave added wings to his heels as wrell as his shoulders.“Those have a short Lent (saith poor Richard,) who owemoney to be paid at Easter.” Then since, as he says, “ Theborrower is a slave to the lender, and the debtor to thecreditor;” disdain the chain, preserve your freedom, andmaintain your independence; be industrious and free, befrugal and free.At present, perhaps, you may think yourselves in thrivingcircumstances, and that you can bear a little extravagancewithout injury ; but“ For age and want save what you mayNo morning sun lasts a whole day,”as poor Richard says. Gain may be temporary and uncer¬tain ; but, ever while you live, expense is constant and certain ;and “ It is easier to build two chimneys than to keep one infuel,” as poor Richard says. So, “ Rather go to bed supper¬less than rise in debt.”“ Get what you can, and what you get hold,’Tis the stone that will turn all your lead into gold,”as poor Richard says. And when you have got the philoso¬pher’s stone, sure you will no longer complain of bad times,or the difficulty of paying taxes.This doctrine, my friends, is reason and wisdom ; but, afterall. do not depend too much on your own industry, and fru-14gality, and prudence, though excellent things ; for they mayall be blasted, without the blessing of heaven ; and thereforeask that blessing humbly, and be not uncharitable to thosethat at present seem to want it, but comfort and help them.Remember, Job suffered, and was afterwards prosperous.And now-to conclude: “Experience keeps a dear school;but fools will learn in no other, and scarce in thatfor, it istrue, “We may give advice, but we cannot give conduct,” aspoor Richard says. However, remember this, “They thatwill not be counselled, cannot be helped," as poor Richardsays; and further, that“ If you will not hear reason, she will rap your knuckles.”Thus the old gentleman ended his harangue. The peopleheard it, and approved the doctrine; and immediately prac¬tised the contrary, just as if it had been a common sermon ;for the auction opened, and they began to buy extravagantly,notwithstanding all his cautions, and their own fear of taxes.I found the good man had thoroughly studied my Alman¬acks, and digested all I dropped on those topics during thecourse of twenty-five years. The frequent mention he madeof me must have tried any one else ; but my vanity was won¬derfully delighted with it, though I was conscious that not atenth part of the wisdom was my own, which he ascribed tome, but rather the gleanings that I had made of the sense ofall ages and nations. However, I resolved to be the betterfor the echo of it; and, though I had at first determined tobuy stuff for a new coat, I went away, resolved to wear myold one a little longer. Reader, if thou wilt do the same, thyprofit will be as great as mine.I am, as ever, thine to serve thee,RICHARD SAUNDERS.THE WHISTLE;A TRDE STORY.Written to his Nephew.When I was a child at seven ypars old, my friends on aholiday filled my pockets with coppers. I went directly to ashop where they sold toys for children; and being charmedwith the sound of a whistle that I met by the way in the handsof another boy, I voluntarily offered him all my money for ft.i5) I then came home, and went whistling all over the house," much pleased with my whistle, but disturbing all the family.My brothers and sisters, and cousins, understanding the bar¬gain I had made, told me I had given four times as much forit as it was worth. This put me in mind what good things Imight have bought with the rest of the money; and theylaughed at me so much for my folly, that I cried with vexa¬tion ; and the reflection gave me more chagrin than the whistlegave me pleasure.This, however, was afterwards of use to me, the impressioncontinuing 6n my mind ; so that often when I was tempted tobuy some unnecessary thing, I said to myself, Don’t give toomuch for the whistle; and so I saved my money.As I grew up, came into the world, and observed the actionsof men, I thought I met with many, very many, who gave toomuch for the whistle.When I saw any one too ambitious of court favours, sacri¬ficing his time in attendance on levees, his repose, his liberty,his virtue, and perhaps his friends to attain it, I have said tomyself, This man gives too much for his whistle.When I saw another fond of popularity, constantly employ¬ing himself in political bustles, neglecting his own affairs, andruining them by that neglect; He pays, indeed, says I, toomuch for his whistle.If I knew a miser, who gave up every kind of comfortableliving, all the pleasure of doing good to others, all the esteemof his fellow-citizens, and the joys of benevolent friendship,for the sake of accumulating wealth ; Poor man, says I, youdo indeed pay too much for your whistle.When I meet a man of pleasure, sacrificing every laudableimprovement of the mind, or of his fortune, to meet corporealsensations; Mistaken man, says I, you are providing pain foryourself instead of pleasure, you give too much for your whistle.If I see one fond of fine clothes, fine furniture, fine equi¬pages, all above his fortune, for which he contracts debts, andends his career in prison ; Alas 1 says I, he has paid dear, verydear for his whistle '. #When I see a beautiful sweet-tempered girl married to anill-natured husband ; What a pity it is, says I, that she haspaid so much for a whistle !In short, I conceived that great part of the miseries of man¬kind were brought upon them by the false estimates they hadmade of the value of things, and by their giving too much fortheir whistle!16THE ADVANTAGES OF DRUNKENNESS.“ Oh! that men should put an enemy into then- mouths to stealaway their brains.”—Shakspeare.“ All the enemies on the earth do not destroy so many of thehuman race, nor alienate so much property as drunkenness.”—Lord Bacon.If you wish to be always thirsty, be a drunkard; for theoftener and more you drink, the oftener and more thirsty youwill be.If you seek to prevent your friends from raising you in theworld, be a drunkard ; for that will defeat all their efforts.If you would effectually counteract your own attempts todo well, be a drunkard ; and you will not be disappointed.If you wish to repel the endeavours of the whole humanrace to raise you to character, credit, and prosperity^, be adrunkard ; and you will assuredly triumph.If you are determined to be poor, be a drunkard ; and youwill soon be ragged and pennyless.If you would wish to starve your family, be a drunkard ; forthat will consume the means of their support.If you would be spunged on by knaves, be a drunkard ; andthat will make their task easy.If you wish to be robbed, be a drunkard ; which will enablethe thief to do it rvith more safety.If you wish to blunt your senses, be a drunkard ; and youwill soon be more stupid than an ass.If you would become a fool, be a drunkard ; and you willsoon lose your understanding.If you wish to incapacitate yourself for rational intercourse,be a,drunkard ; for that will render y-ou wholly' unfit for it.If yTou wish all yrour prospects in life to be clouded, be adrunkard; and they will be dark enough.If you would destroy your body, be a drunkard ; as drunk¬enness is the mother of disease.If you mean to ruin«your soul, be a drunkard ; that youmay be excluded from heaven.If you are resolved on suicide, be a drunkard; that being asure mode of destruction.If you would expose both your folly and secrets, be a drunk¬ard ; and they will soon run out while the liquor runs in.If you are plagued with great bodily strength, be a drunk¬ard ; and it will soon be subdued by so powerful an antago¬nist.17If you would get rid of your money without knowing how,he a drunkard ; and it will vanish insensibly.If you would have no other resource when past labour buta workhouse, be a drunkard ; and you will be unable to pro¬vide any.If you are determined to expel all domestic harmony fromyour house, be a drunkard ; and discord, with all her train,will soon enter.If you would be always under strong suspicion, be a drunk¬ard ;"for, little as you think it, all agree that those who stealfrom themselves and families will rob others.If you would be reduced to the necessity of shunning yourcreditors, be a drunkard ; and you will soon have reason toprefer the bye paths to the public streets.If you like the amusements of a court of conscience, be adrunkard ; and you may be often gratified.If you would be a dead weight to the community, and “ cum¬ber the ground,” be a drunkard; for that will render youhouseless, helpless, burdensome, and expensive.If you would be a nuisance, be a drunkard ; for the reproachof a drunkard is like that of a dunghill.If you would be odious to your family and friends, be adrunkard; and you will soon be more than disagreeable.If you would be a pest to society, be a drunkard; and youwill be avoided as infections.If you dread reformation of your faults, be a drunkard ; andyou will be impervious to all admonition.If you would smash windows, break the peace, get yourbones broken, tumble under carts and horses, and be lockedup in watch houses, be a drunkard ; and it will be strange ifyou do not succeed.Finally, if you are determined to be utterly destroyed inestate, body, and soul, be a drunkard ; and you will soon knowthat it is impossible to adopt a more effectual means to accom¬plish your—end.Drunkenness expels reason—drowns the memory defacesbeauty—diminishes strength—inflames the blood—causes in¬ternal, external, and incurable wounds—is a witch to thesenses, a devil to the soul, a thief to the purse—the beggar’scompanion, a wife’s wo, and children’s sorrow — makes astrong man weak, and a wise man a fool. He is worse thana beast, and is a self-murderer, who drinks to others’ goodhealth, and robs himself of his own.18MAXIMS FOR MARRIED GENTLEMEN.1. There arc two ways of governing a family. The firstby force—the other by mild and vigilant authority. The firstis brutal, and you certainly lose your happiness in adopting it.The second will occasion you to be respected, and your direc¬tions to be observed. A husband deserves to lose his empirealtogether, by making an attempt to force it by violence.2. Never contradict your wife; you never did so beforemarriage, and do not begin it now. There is something soharsh about contradiction in a man, that it always generatesan unkindly feeling. It prevents that confidence which oughtto exist between married persons ; and confidence destroyed,we cannot hope for much good after.3. You cannot possibly have a better or trustier confidantthan your wife. She will always advise for the best, and verysafely too. Trust her wholly.4. Be strictly moral in your conduct. How can you pre¬tend to be a guide to your house, if you are not ? Considerwhat you would think if your wife would become immoral inher conduct.5. Be as attentive in reason after marriage as you were incourtship. Attention to your wife is respect to yourself; itis her due, and shows clearly that you do not regret yourchoice.6. Pride yourself only on those qualities which a man oughtto possess, and give your wife credit for hers. You ought tohave a manly understanding; but remember that infers nosuperiority over the lady’s.7. When your wife has given you council, which, from yourknowledge of the world, you judge cannot safely be acted on,do not reproach her, but convince her by mild reasoningthat it is inappropriate. Give her always the merit of goodintentions.8. Should your wife be out of temper, do not see it; thereare many little vexations you know not of; never speakharshly to her, nor be rude.9. Be careful in your choice of friends ; you have one thatwill never desert you; cherish her.10. Dress well according to your station in society; beneither a sloven nor a dandy. Commend your wife’s taste indress, and you may keep her heart as long as you like. No¬thing so much secures a lady’s good will as this, and it is avery slight sacrifice made at the altar of her vanity.1911. Never meddle with domestic or houschould concents,they are not for a man's care. Be careful in your expendi¬ture, and waste nothing, though you must be liberal to theppor. Never swear, nor storm, nor blow up. Let your homebe the pole star of your affections, and always spend yourevenings there.• 12. Always pay attention to your wife, in society as well asin private, and show yourself fully aware of her good qualities.All your happiness is reposed in her. Never show any thinglike indifference or slight; she will repay your kindness bythat tenderness of affection which is worth all the worldbeside. Seek no pleasure to which she cannot be made aparty.MAXIMS FOR MARRIED LADIES.; 1. Let every wife be persuaded that there are two ways ofgoverning a family; the first is by the expression of that which! will belong to force ; the second to the power of mildness, toi which every strength will yield. One is the power of thehusband ; a wife should never employ any other arms thanof gentleness. When a woman accustoms herself to say, Ii will, she deserves to lose her empire.2. Avoid contradicting your husband. When we smell ata rose, it is to imbibe the sweets of its odour; we likewise1 look for every thing that is amiable in woman. Whoever is! often contradicted feels insensibly an aversion for the personI who contradicts, which gains strength by time; and, whateverI be her qualities, is not easily destroyed.3. Occupy yourself only with household affairs ; wait till| your husband confides to you those of higher importance, andi do not give your advice till he asks it.I 4. Never take upon yourself to be a censor of your hus-I band's morals, and do not read lectures to him. Let your[ preaching be a good example, and practise virtue yourself toi make him in love with it.i 5. Command his attention by being always attentive to him ;never exact any thing, and you will obtain much ; appear al¬ways flattered by the little he does for you, which will excitehim to perform more.6. All men are vain ; never wound his vanity, not even inthe most trifling instances. A wife may have more sense thanher husband, but she should never seem to know it.7. When a man gives wrong counsel, never make him feel1 that he has done so; but lead him on by degrees to what issorational, with mildness and gentleness ; when he is convinced,leave him to the merit of having found out what is just andreasonable.8. When a husband is out of temper, behave obligingly tohim; if he is abusive, never retort; and never prevail overhim to humble him.9. Choose well your friends, have but few, and be carefulof following their advice in all matters.10. Cherish neatness without luxury, and pleasure withoutexcess; dress with taste, particularly with modesty ; vary thefashions of your dress, especially in regard to colours. It givesa change to the ideas, and recalls pleasing recollections. Suchthings may appear trifling, but they are of more importancethan is imagined.11. Never be curious to pry into your husband’s con¬cerns, but obtain his confidence at all times, by that whichyou repose in him. Always preserve order and economy;avoid being out of temper, and be careful never to scold ; bythese means he will find his own house pleasanter than anyother.12. Seem always to obtain information from him, especiallybefore company, though you may pass yourself for a simple¬ton. Never forget that a wife owes all her importance to thatof her husband. Leave him entirely master of his own actions,to go or come whenever he thinks fit. A wife ought to makeher company amiable to her husband, that he will not be ableto exist without it, then he will not seek for pleasure abroad,if she do not partake of it with him.THE CAUSES OF MEN WANTING MONET.Since money is a thing so necessary and so useful, and thewant of a competency of it, makes a man so very miserable,rendering him liable to all the scorn and contempt that an ill-natured world can throw upon him ; it seems strange so manyshould want it, especially those that know the worth of it. And,therefore, it may be worth our inquiring into the causes fromwhence tliis want proceeds, I mean the common and ordinarycauses ; for there are some causes that are extraordinary, suchas all our wit and prudence can neither foresee nor avoid.Such was that extraordinary and surprising storm in November1703, whereby many thousands were undone, as to their estates,besides the many lives that were lost; and such also wTas thedreadful fire in London, whereby some that had great estates21the one week, had scarce bread to eat the next; and in thetime of war many are unavoidably losers. But these must notbe reckoned the common and ordinary ways that make andkeep men poor. We know, indeed, that by the divine provi¬dence, in the body of a commonwealth there must be bothpoor and rich, even as a human body cannot subsist withouthands and feet to labour, and walk about to provide for theother members ; so the rich being the belly, which devour all,yet do no part of the work; but the cause of every man’spoverty is not one and the same ; some are poor by conditionand content with their calling, and neither seek nor can workthemselves into better condition ; yet God raised up, as by amiracle, the children and posterity of these, oftentimes, topossess the most eminent places either in church or common¬wealth, as to become Archbishops, Bishops, Judges, Com-manders-general in the field, Secretaries of State, Statesmen,and the like ; so that it proveth not always true which thepoet says,“ If poor thou art, then poor thou shall remainRich men alone do now rich gifts obtain.”Of this condition are the greatest number in every kingdom;others there are, who have possessed great estates, but theseestates have not thriven or continued, being gotten by oppres¬sion, deceit, usury, and the like, which commonly lasteth notto the third generation, according to the poet—“ It seldom is the grandchild’s lot,To be the heir of goods not justly got.”Others come to want and misery, by spending their fairestates in ways of vicious living, as on drink and women ; forBacchus aud Venus are inseparable companions; and he thatis familiar with the one, is never a stranger to the other.“ In same way, manner, and end.Both wine and women do offend.”Some again live in perpetual want, being naturally whollygiven to idleness. These are the drones of a commonwealth,who deserve not to live. “ He that laboureth not, should noteat. Labour night and day, rather than be burthensome,”saith the Apostle Paul; both country and city swarm withthis kind of people; “The diligent hand,” saith Solmon,“ shall make rich ; but the sluggard shall have a scarcity of[ bread.”I remember when I was in the Low Countries, there were' three soldiers, a Dutchman, a Scot, and an Englishman, who,for their misdemeanours, were condemned to be hanged ; yet22their lives were begged by three several men, one a bricklayer,that he might help him to make bricks, and carry them to thewalls; the other was a brewer of Delft, who begged his manto fetch water, and do other work in the brew-house ; and thethird by a gardener, to help him to work in and dress a hop¬garden. The first two accepted their offers thankfully; butthe last, the Englishman, told his master in plain terms, hisfriends had never brought him up to gather hops ; and there¬fore desired rather to be hanged.Others have had great estates left unto them by their friends,and who never knew the pain and care of getting them, have,as one said truly, galloped through them in a very short time ;these are such as Solomon speaketh of, “ who having richeshave.no hearts, or rather the wit, to use them.” These menare most aptly compared to the willow-tree, because the palmsof the willow-tree are no sooner ripe but blown away with thewind.I remember to have heard of a wealthy citizen of London,in Queen Elizabeth’s time, who left his. son a great sum ofmoney, who imagined he should never be able to spend it;would usually make ducks and drakes in the Thames withshillings, as boys were wont to do with tile sherds and oystershells; and at the end came to such extreme want, that hewas under the necessity of borrowing sixpence, having manytimes more shoes than feet, and sometimes more feet thanshoes, as the beggar said in the comedy.Many also there are, who having been born to a good estate,have quite undone themselves by marriage, and that after atwofold manner ; first, by matching themselves without adviceof parents or friends, in heat of youth, unto proud, foolish, andlight women, that one would better live on small allowance ata distance, than have a full meal at home, where he is alwaystroubled with her never-ceasing tongue. And this is thereason so many husbands travel beyond seas ; or at home gofrom town to town, or from tavern to tavern, to look for com¬pany ! and in a word, to spend any thing, to live any where,save at home, in their own houses, where they are sure tohear nothing but the brawlings of a scolding woman !DIRECTIONSHOW PERSONS MAY SUPPLY THEMSELVES WITHMONEY AT ALL TIMES.If you would ask me what course you should take, or whatyou should do to make money, I would say, bethink yourself23I to what profession or trade you have been formerly broughtup to. If of the inferior or middle sort of tradesmen or arti-( fleers, (for those are chiefly concerned in this unhappiness,)r you musffirst, be very diligent and industrious in your busi-! ness; and, secondly, take heed of idleness, and all vain and; idle companions, that loiter up and down, and squander away> their time as if it were of no value, though it is the most' precious thing in the world, there being nothing in the worldi' that is a more certain indication of ruin and destructionn than the wasting and misimproving of our time. And yet this* is done by those that would take it ill to be charged there-* with ; as for instance, how many are there that spend a great‘ deal of their time in coffee-houses and weekly clubs! where,I though but little money is pretended to be spent, yet a great| deal of precious time is squandered away and lost! which many} that frequent thesc places never think of, but measure theirI expenses only by what goes out of their pockets, not consider¬ing what they might have gained in the time by their labour,| and what they might have saved by keeping at their busi¬ness.Let us therefore reckon, when a tradesman goes to the cof¬fee-house or ale-house to take a morning draught, (let it be of'what liquor he wills,) while he is spending his twopence, smok¬ing and talking, he loses at least an hour of his time; and inthe evening he goes to his twopenny club, and there tarriesfrom six till ten. Now, it must be a very poor trade, if inthat time he could not have earned a shilling. And if hekeeps servants, the want of his presence at home may haveoccasioned his losing as much as he could have gained him¬self ; so that his spending a groat morning and night, (whichis fourpence each time,) cannot be accounted less than theloss of 2s. 8d. a-day, which comes to 16s. a-week, and £41 12s.a-year, which sum if saved, until his eldest son arrived at 21years of age, and so fit for marriage, and to set up in trade,would have amounted to £873 12s. They who would live soas not to want money, must avoid all such idle and needlessexpenses, and unnecessary loss of time.But if the person complaining of the want of money, hasbeen brought up to no trade, then let him consider to whatkind of life his genius or natural disposition does most of allincline him. If he cannot find employment in his own coun¬try to suit his genius, (which can scarcely be supposed in acountry such as Great Britain, where arts and science arecarried to the greatest perfection, and where a person of anygenius, or of little genius, may find employment,) let him seekhis fortune abroad. He may at once satisfy his curiosity, sup-24ply his necessity, and serve his country, by going into thearmy or navy, and thereby have an opportunity of doing braveactions in the service of his country abroad, and there ho maycome to advantage both his fortune and family.—If he in¬clines not the employment of the army or navy, he may findsomething to suit him in our Plantations in the East and WestIndies or in America, in all which places many a man hathdone well, who could do nothing at home. Thus you shallfind great contentment to your conscience to be in action,which God commands us all to be.The times in no age were so hard as to deny industry andingenuity a livelihood; and, in a word, rather to be in miserytor want of money, let a man undertake any vocation andlabour, and“ Never think the labour coarseThat puts a penny in the purse.”The want of money is a great torment, and often puts menon unlawful shifts to procure it; therefore, let every one whohas got money, be careful to know its worth ; for since we areborn we must live, and it is hard to live upon a small share ofit. And to conclude this chapter, let us be always careful toget, and cautious in spending money; and when you have it,know how to keep and how to use it, when there is occasion ;for money in your pocket is the best companion. As oneobserved, “ be a good husband, and thou wilt soon get a pennyto spend, a penny to lend, and a penny for thy friend.” ForI would have none to be such misers as to gain money only tokeep, and not make use of it; for to such, money is the great¬est curse, of which the world has been furnished with manyinstances.“ Gain a penny, spend a penny,(Says the frugal man;)But if you spend before you gain,You’ll ne’er be merry then.”

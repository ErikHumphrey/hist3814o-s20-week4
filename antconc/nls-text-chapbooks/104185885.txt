THE HISTORYOFWHITTINGTON AND HIS CAT,ADDTHE STORYr>tPUSS IN BOOTS.- %ji -iGLASGOW;PUBLISHED BY FRANCIS ORR & SONS,161V OTSCOTLAND r\BISTORTOFWHITTINGTON AND HIS CAT>Ik the reign of the famous King Edward the Third,there was a little boy called Dick Whittington,whose father and mother died when he was veryyoung, so that he remembered nothing at all aboutthem, and was left a dirty little fellow running abouta country village. As poor Dick was not old enoughto work, lie was in a sorry plight; he got but littlefor bis dinner, and sometimes nothing at all for hisbreakfast; for the people who lived in the villagewere very poor themselves, and could spare him lit¬tle more than the parings of potatoes, and now andthen a hard crust.For all this, Dick Whittington was a very sharpooy, and was always listening to what every onetalked about.On Sundays he never failed to get. near the fano*WHITTINOTO:-: AND K!S CAT.ers, as they sat talking ou li e tombstones in thechurchyard, before the parson was come : and oncea-week you might be sure to see little Dick leaningagainst the sign-post of the village ale-house, wherepeople stopped to drink as they came from the nextmarket-town; and whenever the barber's shop-doorwas open, Dick listened to all the news he told hiscustomers.In this manner, Dick heard of the great citycalled London ; how the people who lived therewere all fine gentlemen and ladies; that there weresinging and music in it all day long; and that thestreets were paved all over with gold.One day a waggoner, with a large waggon andeight horses, all with bells at their heads, drovethrough the village while Dick was lounging nearhis favourite sign-posi. The thought immediatelystruck him that it must be going to the fine townof London; and taking courege lie asked the wag¬goner to let him walk with him by the side of thewaggon. The man, hearing from poor Dick thathe had no parents, and seeing by his ragged condi¬tion that he could not be worse oft', told him hemight go if he would: so they set off together.Dick got safe to London: and so eager was he tosee the fine streets paved all over with gold, that heran as fast as his legs would carry him throughseveral streets, expecting every moment to come toWHITTINGTON AND HIS CAT.7cruelly; and added, site would certainly be turnedaway if she did not treat him with more kindness.But though the cook was so ill-tempered, Mr.Fitzwarren’s footman was quite the contrary: hehad lived in the family many years, was rather el¬derly, and had once a little boy of h:s own, whodied when about the age of Wh'tt’ngton ; so hecould not but feel compassion tor the poor boy.As the footman was very fond of reading, he usedgenerally in the evening to entertain his fellow-ser¬vants, when they had done their woik, w’th someamusing book. The pleasure our little hero tookin hearing him made him very much desire to learnto read too; so the next time the good-naturedfootman gave him a halfpenny, he bought a horn¬book with it; and, with a little of his help, Dicksoon learned his letters, and afterwards to read.About this time, Miss Alice was going out onemorning for a walk; and the footman happening tobe out of the way, little Dick, who had receivedfrom Mr. Fitzwarren a neat suit of clothes, to go tochurch on Sundays, was ordered to put them on,and walk beh'nd her. As they walked along. MissAlice, seeing a poor woman with one child in tierarms, and another at her hack, pulled out her purse,and gave her some money; and as she was puttingit again into her pocket, she dropped it on theground, and walked on, Luckily Dick, who was8WHITTINGTON AND HIS CAT.behind, saw what she had done, picked it up, andimmediately presented it to her.Besides the ill-humour of the cook, which now,however, was somewhat mended, Whittington hadanother hardship to get over. This was, that hisbed, which was of flock, was placed in a garret,where there were so many holes in the floor andwalls, that he never went to bed without beingawakened in his sleep by great numbers of rats andmice, which generally ran over his face, and madesuch a noise, that he sometimes thought the wallswere tumbling dow'n about him.One day a gentleman who paid a visit, to Mr.Fitzwarren, happened to have dirtied his shoes, andbegged they might be cleaned. Dick took greatpains to make them shine, and the gentleman gavehim a penny. This he resolved to lay out in buy¬ing a cat, if possible; and the next day, seeing alittle girl with a cat under her arm, he went up toher, and asked if she would let him have it for apenny; to which the girl leplied, she would withall her heart, for her mother had more cats than shecould maintain; adding, that the one she had was’ an excellent mouser.ij This cat Whittington hid in the garret, alwaystaking care to carry her a part of his dinner: and ina short time he had no further disturbance fromthe rats and mice, but slept as sound as a top*.IWHITTINGTON AND HI? CaT.5those that were all paved with gold; for Dick hadthree times seen a guinea in his own village, andobserved what a great deal of money it brought inchange; so he imagined he had only to tak ? upsome little bits of the pavement, to have as muchmoney as he desired.Poor Dick ran till he was tired, and at last,finding it grow dark, and that whichever way heturned he saw nothing but dirt instead of gold, hesat down in a dark corner, and cried himself asleep.Little Dick remained all night in the streets;and next morning, finding himself very hungry, hegot up and walked about, askhig those he met togive him a halfpenny to keep him from starving;but nobody staid to answer him, and only two orthree gave him any thing; so that the poor boy wassoon in the most miserable condition. Being almoststarved to death, he laid himself down at the doorof one Mr. Fitzwarren, a great rich merchant. Herehe was scon perceived by ihe cook-maid, who wasan ill-tempered creature, ai d happened just then tobe very busy dressing dinner f .r her master andmistress; so, seeing poiT Dick, she called out,“ What business have yea there, yon lazy rogue ?There is nothing else but beggars; if yon do nottake yourself away, we will see Infw you will like asousing of some dish-water I have here that is hotenough to make von caper?”0 WHlTl'INUlOS AMD HiS CAT. ^Just at this time Mr. Fitzwarren himself cawhome from the city to dinner, and seeing a dirtyragged hoy lying at the door, said to him, “ \\ hyj.do you lie there, my lad? \'<>u seem nl I enough to.work. 1 fear you must be somewhat Lie.”—“ No„indeed. Sir,” says Whittington, “ that is not true,^for I would work with all my heart, but I knowrnobody, and I believe I am very sick for want offfood.”—“ Poor fellow!” answered Mr. Fitzwarren.Dick now tried to rise, but was obliged to lie down!again, being too weak to stand; for lie had noteaten any thing for three days, and was no longerable to run about and beg a halfpenny of people inthe streets: so the kind merchant orderetl that heshould be taken into his house, and have a gooddinner immediately, and that lie should be kept todo what dirty work he was able for the cook.Little Dick would have lived very happily inthis worthy family, had it not been for the crabbedcook, who was finding fault and scolding at himfrom morning till night; an I was withal so fond ofroasting and basting, that, when the spit was out ofher hands, she would be at basting jnior Dick's headand shoulders with a broom, or any thing e!*e thathappened to fall in her way; till at last her ill usageof him was told to Miss Alice, Mr. Fitzwarren’sdaughter, who asked the ill-tempered creature if shewas not ashamed to use a little friendless boy *?WHITTINGTO* AND HIS CAT.9Soon after this, the merchant, who had a shipready to sail, richly laden, arid thinking it but justthat all his seivants should have some chance forgood luck as well as himself, called them into theparlour, and asked them what commodity they choseto send.All raentioaeii something they were willing toventure Oiu. poor Whittington, who, having nomoney nor goods, could send nothing at all, forwhich reason he did not come in with the rest; butMiss Alice, guessing what was the matter, orderedhim to be called, and offered to lay down somemoney for him from her own purse; but this, themerchant observed, would not do, for it must besomething of his own.Upon this, poor Dick said, he had nothing but acat, which he bought for a penny that was givenhim.“ Fetch thy cat, boy,” says Mr. Fitzwarren,“ and let her go.”Whittington brought poor puss, and deliveredher to the captain with tears in his eyes; for hesaid, “ He should now again be kept awake all nightby the rats and mice.”All the company laughed at the oddity of Whit¬tington’s adventure; and Miss Alice, who felt thegreatest pity for the poor boy, gave him some half¬pence to buy another cat,WHlTJIh'GTON AS1]) HIS CAT.U)This.ami several other marks of kindness shownhim by I\1jss Alice, made the ill-tempered cook sojealous of the favours the poor boy received, that shebegan to use him mure cruelly than ever, and con¬stantly made game of him for sending his cat to sea;asking him, if he thought it would sell for as muchmoney as would buy a halter.At last, the unhappy little fellow, being unableto bear this treatment any longer, determined to runaway from his place: he accordingly packed up thefew things that belonged .to h!m, and set out veryearly in the morning on Allhallow Day, which isthe first of November. He travelled as far as Hol¬loway, and there sat down on a stone, which to thisday is called Whittington's Stone, and began toconsider what course he should takeWhile he was thus thinking what he could do.Bow-bells, of which there were then only six, beganto ring; and it seemed to him that their soundsaddressed him in this manner:“ Tom again, Whittington,Lord Mayor of London.”“ Lord Mayor of London !” says he to himself.“ Why, to be sure, I would bear any tiling to beLord Mayor of London, and ride in a fine coach!Well, 1 will go back, and think nothing cf all th«cuffing and scolding of old Cicely, if I am at last tobe Lord Mayor of Loudon.”WHliilM/IOK A Nit ill' CAT.nSo back went Dick, and got into the house, and *etIbout his business, before Cicely came down staiis.The shijj, with the cat on board, was long beatenut at sea, and was at last driven by contraryinds on a part of the coast of Barbary, ii habitedv Moors that were unknown to the English.The natives in this country came in great nurn-rs, out of curiosity, to see the people on board,ho were all of so different a colour from thein-Ives, and treated them with great civility, and, asey became better acquainted, showed marks ofagerness to purchase the fine things with which|he ship was ladenThe captain, seeing this, sent patterns of thehoicest articles he had to the king of the country,vho was so much pleased with them, that he sentor the captain and his chief mate to the palace,dere they wire placed, as is the custom of the;ountry, on tich carpets flowered with gold andliver: and the king and queen being seated at thejpjier end of the room, dinner was brought in, whichrondsted of the greatest rarities. No sooner, how¬ever, were the dishes set before the company, thanan amazing number of rats and mice rushed in, andhelped themselves plentifully from every dish, scat¬tering pieces of flesh and gravy all about the room.The captain, extremely astonished, asked if these▼•nnin wer* not very offensive ?WHITTINGTON' AND HIS CAT.12“ Oh, yes,” said they, “ very offensive ; and th.'Sjking would give half his treasure to be free of them itifor they not only destroy his dinner, but they dis- itmb him even in his chamber, so that he is obligecMto be watched while he sleeps.”The captain, who was ready to jump for joy, re-llmembering poor Whittington’s hard case, and thecat he had intrusted to his care, told him he had a icreature on board his ship that would kill them all.The king was still more overjoyed than the cap- :tain. “ Bring this creature to me,” says he; “ andif she can really perform what you say, I will loadyour ship with wedges of gold in exchange for her."Away flew the captain, while another dinner wasproviding, to the ship, and taking puss under hisarm, returned to the palace in time to see the tablecovered with rats and mice, and the second dinnerin a fair way to meet with the same fate as the first.The cat, at sight of them, did not wait for bid¬ding, but sprang from the captain's arms, and in afew moments laid the greatest part of the rats andmice dead at her feet, while the rest, in the greatestflight imaginable, scampered away to their holes.Tiie king, having seen and considered of the won-deiful exploits of Mrs. Puss, and being informed shewould soon have young ones, which might in timedestroy all the rats and mice in the country, bar¬gained with the captain for Ids whole ship’s cargo.WHITTINGTON' AND HIS CAT. 13/Hid afterwards agreed to give a prodigious quantityof wedges of gold, of still greater value, for the cat;with which, afler taking leave of their majesties,and other great personages belonging to the court,he, with all his ship’s company, set sail, with a fairwind for England, and, after a happy voyage, ar¬rived safely in the port of London.One morning, Mr. Fitzwarren had ju«t enteredhis counting-house, and was going to seat himself atthe desk, when who should arrive hut the captainand mate of the merchant-ship, the Unicorn, justarrived from the coast of Barbary, and followed byseveral men, bringing with them a prodigious quan¬tity of wedges of gold, that had been paid by theKing of Barbary in exchange for the merchandize,and also in exchange for Mrs. Puss. Mr. Fitz¬warren, the iiwtant he heard the news, orderedWhittington to be called, and having desired him tobe seated, said, “ Mr. Whittington, most heartilydo I rejoice in the news these gentlemen havebrought you ; for the capta n has sold your cat tothe King of Barbary, and brought you in returnmore riches than I possess in the whole world; andmay you long enjoy themMr. Fitzwarren then desired the men to open theimmense treasures they had brought, and added,that Mr, Whittington had now nothing to do but toput it in some place of safety.HWHITTINGTON A.N'jB HIS CAT.Poor Dick could scarce contain himself for joy •he begged his master to take what jiarf of it Ik;pleased, since to his kindness he was indebted forthe whole. “ No, no, this wealth is all your own,and justly so," answered Mr. F'tzwarren, “ and [have no doubt you will use it generously.”Whittington, however, w7as too kind-hearted tokeep all himself; and, accordingly, made a hand¬some present to the captain, the mate, and everyone of the ship’s company, and afterwards to hisexcellent friend the footman, and the rest of Mr.Fitzwarren’s servants, not even excepting crabbedold Cictly.After this, Mr. Fitzwarren advised him to sendfor tradespeople, and get himself dressed as became agentleman, and made him the offer of his house to livein, till he could provide himself with a better.When Mr. Whittington’s face was washed, hishair curled, his hat cocked, and he was dressedin a fashionable suit of clothes, he appeared as hand¬some and genteel as any young man who visited atMr, Fitzwarren’s; so that Miss Alice, who hadformerly thought of him with compassion, now con-sidt red him as fit to be her lover; and the more so,no doubt, because Mr. Whittington was constantlytl inking what he could do to oblige her, and makingher the prettiest presents imaginable.Mr. Fitzwarren, perceiving their affection for .WHlTmOTON AJiD HIS CAT. 15each other, proposed to unite them in marriage, towhich, without difficulty, they each consented ; andaccordingly a day for the wedding was soon fixedi and they were attended to church by the lordi mayor, the court of aldermen, the sheriffs, and a| great number of the wealthiest merchants in Lon-l don ; and the ceremony was succeeded by a mostelegant entertainment and splendid ball.History tells us that the said Mr. Whittingtonand his lady lived in great splendour and were veryhappy ; that they had several children ; that he was| sheriff of London in the year 1.340, and several1 times afterwards loid mayor ; that in the last year4 of his mayoralty he entertained King Henry theI Fifth, on his return fiom the battle of Agincourt.And some time afterwards, going with an addressjj from the city on one of his majesty’s victories, heII received the honour of knighthood.Sir Richard Whittington constantly fed greatnumbeis of the poor; he built a church and col-■p lege to it, with a yeaily allowance to poor scholars,u and near it erected an hospital.The effigy of Sir Richard Whittington was to be3i seen, with his cat in his arms, carved in stone, over1; the archway of the late prison of Newgate, thatii went actoss Newgate Street.THE STORYf -'"i*■3l*PUSS IN HOOTS.There wm a Miller who had three sons, and whenhe died he divided what he possessed among them inthe following manner;—He gave his Mill to theeldest, his Ass to the second, and his Cat to theyoungest.Each of the brothers accordingly took what be¬longed to him without the help of an attorney, whowould soon have brought their little fortune tonothing in law expenses.The poor young fellow who had nothing but theCat, complained that he was hardly used. “ Mybrothers,” said he “by Joining the;r stocks toge¬ther, may do very well in the world ; but for me,when I have eaten my Cat, and made a cap of hitskin, I may tiien die of hunger !”puss Jrr boots.19■ide with Ins daughter, who was the most beautifulprincess in the world, he said to his master, “ If youwould hut follow my advice your fortune is made.Take off your clothes, and bathe yourself in theriver, just in the place 1 shall show you, and leavethe rest to me.”The Marquis of Carabas did exactly as he wasdesired, without being able to guess at what theCat intended. While he was bathing the Kingpassed by, and Puss directly called out as loud ashe could bawl—“ Help ! help ! my Lord Marquisof Curabas is in danger of being drowned !” TheKing, hearing the cries, put his head out at thewindow of his carriage to see what was the matter;when perceiving the very cat who had brought himso many presents, he ordered his attendants to godirectly to the assistance of my Lord Marquis ofCarabas.While they were employed in taking the Marquisout of the river, the Cat ran to the King’s carriage,and told his Majesty that while his master wasbathing, some thieves had run off with his clothesas they lay by the river side, the cunning Cat allthe time having hid them under a large stone.The King, hearing this, commanded the officersof his wardrobe to fetch one of the handsomest suitsit contained, and present it to the Lord Marquis ofCaracas, at the same time loading him with a thou-PUSS IN BOOTS.20sand attentions. As the fine clothes they broughthim made him look like a gentleman, and set oil' hisperson, which was very comely, to the greatestadvantage, the King’s daughter was mightily takenwith his appearance, and the Marquis of Carabashad no sooner cast upon her two or three respectfulglances, than she became violently in love with him.The King insisted on his getting into the carriage,and taking a ride with them. The Cat, enchantedto see how well his scheme was likely to succeed,ran before to a meadow that was reaping, and saidto the reapers—“ Good people, if you do not tellthe King, who will soon pass this way, that themeadow you are reaping belongs to my Lord Mar¬quis of Carabas, you shall be chopped as small asmince meat.”The King did not fail to ask the reapers to whomthe meadow belonged ?—“ To my Lord Marquis ofCarpbas,” said they all at once, for the threats ofthe Cat had terribly frightened them. “ You havehere a very fine piece of land, my Lord Marquis,”said the King—“ Truly, Sire,” replied he, “ itdoes not fail to bring me every year a plentiful har¬vest.”The Cat, who still went on before, now came toa field where some other labourers were makingsheaves of the corn they had reaped, to whom hesaid as before—<< Good people, if you do^not tellPUSS IN BOeiS.17The Cat, who all this time sat listening just in¬side the door of a cupboard, now ventured to comeout, and addressed him as follows:—“ Do not thus afflict yourself, my good master;you have only to give me a bag, and get a pair ofboots made for me, so that I may scamper throughthe dirt and the brambles, and you shall see thatyou are not so ill provided for as you imagine.”Though the Cat’s master did not much dependupon these promises, yet, as he had often observedthe cunning tricks with which Puss used to catchrats and mice, sucli as hanging by the hind legs, andhiding in the meal to make them believe he was dead,he did not entirely despair of his being of some useto him in his unhappy condition.When the Cat had obtained what he asked for,he gaily began to equip himself: he drew on theboots, and, putting the bag about his neck, he tookhold of the strings with his fore paws, and, biddinghis master take courage, immediately sallied forth.The first attempt Puss made was to go into awarren, in which there was a great number of rab¬bits. He put some bran and some parsley into hisbag, and then stretched himself out at full length,as if he was dead ; he waited for some young rabbits,which as yet knew nothing of the cunning tricks ofthe tribe, to come and get into the bag, the betterto feast upon the dainties he had put into it.18PUSS IN BOOTS.Scarcely had he lain down before he succeeded asswell as could be wished. A giddy young rabbiecrept into the bag, and the Cat immediately drew"the strings, and killed him without mercy.Puss, proud of his prey, hastened directly to the >palace, where he aski d to speak to the King. Onbeing shown into the apaitnient ot his Majesty, he-made a low bow, and said, “ I have brought you,Sire, this rabbit from the warren of my Lord the iMarquis of Carabas, who commanded me to presentit to your Majesty, with the assurance of his re¬spect.” This was the title which the Cat thoughtproper to bestow on his master. “ Tell my LordMarquis of Carabas,” replied the King, “ that 1.1accept his present with pleasure, and that I am :greatly obliged to him.”Soon after, the Cat laid himself down in the samemanner in a field of corn, and had as much goodfortune as before; for two fine partridges got intohis bag, which he immediately killed and carried tothe palace. The King received them as he haddone the rabbit, and ordered his servants to give themessenger something to drink. In this manner hecontinued to carry presents of game to the Kingfrom my Lord Marquis of Carabas, once at least i«every week.One day, the Cat having heard that the Kingintended to take a ride that morning by the riverPUSS IN BOOTS.21Hie King, who will piesently pass this way, thattlie corn vou have reaped in this held belongs to myLord Marquis of Carabas, you shall be chopped assmall as mince meat.”The King accordingly passed a moment after, andinquired to whom the corn he saw belonged ?—Tomy Lord Marquis of Carabas, answered they vei yglibly; upon which the King again complimentedthe Marquis on his noble possessions.The Cat still continued to go before, and gave thesame charge to all the people he met with ; so thatthe King was greatly astonished at the splendid for¬tune of my Lord Marquis of Carabas.Puss at length arrived at a stately castle, whichbelonged to an Ogre, the richest ever known ; forall the lands the Kin^ had passed through andadmired were his. The Cat took care to lear n everyparticular about the Ogre, and what he could do,and then asked to speak with him, saying, as lieentered the room in which he was, that he couldhonour to inquire for his health.The Ogre received him as civilly as an Ogre coulddo, and desired him to be seated. “ I have beeninformed,” said the Cat, “ that you have the gift ofchanging yourself into all sorts of animals; into alion, or an elephant for example.” “It is verytrue,” replied the Ogre, somewhat sternly ; “ and22J'Lsis IK HUOIi.to convince you, 1 will directly take tlie 1'onn of alion.” The Cat was so nuidi terrified at fuidiughimself so near a lion, that he sprang from him, andclimbed to the roof of the house; but not withoutmuch difficulty, as his boots were not very fit to walkupon the tiles.Some minutes after, the Cat perceiving that theOgre had quitted the form of a lion, ventured tocome down fiom the tiles, and owned that lie hadbeen a good deal frightened. “ I have been furtherinformed,” continued the Cat, “ hut I know nothow to believe it, that you have the power of takingthe form of the smallest animals also ; for example,of changing yourself to a rat or mouse. I confess Ishould think this must be impossible.” “ Impossible ;you shall see and, at the same instant, changedhimself into a mouse, and began to frisk about theroom. The Cat no sooner cast his eyes upon theOgre in this form, than he sprang upon him, anddevoured him in an instant.In the meantime, the King admiring, as he camenear it, the magnificent castle of the Ogre, orderedIds attendants to drive up to the gates, as he wishedto take a nearer view of it. The Cat, hearing thenoise of the carriage on the draw-bridge, immediatelycame out, saying—“ Your Majesty is welcome tothe castle of my Lord Marquis of Carabas.” “ Andis this splendid castle yours also, my Lord MarquisPUSS LV B60TS,23of Carabas ? I never saw any thing more statelythan the building, or more beautiful than the parkand pleasure-grounds around it. No doubt, thecastle is no less magnificent within than without;pray, my Lord Marquis, indulge me with a sight ofit.”The Marquis gave his hand to the young princessas she alighted, and followed the King, who wentbefore. They entered a spacious hall, where theyfound a splendid collation which the Ogre had pre¬pared for some friends he had that day expected tovisit him, but who, hearing that the King with theprincess, and a great gentleman of the court, werewithin, had not dared to enter.The King was so much charmed with the amiablequalities and noble fortune of the Marquis of Carabas,and the young princess, too, had fallen so violentlyin love with him, that when the King had partakenof the collation, and drank a few glasses of wine, hesaid to the Marquis—“ It will he your own fault,my Lord Marquis of Carabas, if you do riot soonbecome my son-in-law.” The Marquis received theintelligence with a thousand respectful acknowledg¬ments, accepted the honour conferred upon him, andmarried the princess that very day.For some time the great banqueting hall of thecastle was thrown open to all, the tables profuselyspread with all the delicacies of the season, every24pusi in soot 'eye beaming with joy, every heart seemed to respondwith delight—all sat round the festive board in thefull enjoyment of unmingled mirth. Twas a heart¬stirring scene, all striving to share the smile of theMarquis and his beautiful bride.I he Cat became a great Lord, and never ran•tt*-r rats and mice but tor his amusement.TISS END,

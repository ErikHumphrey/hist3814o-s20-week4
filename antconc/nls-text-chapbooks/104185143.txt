Is this thy vow ?Sir James the Rose replied ;4.And will MatilJa wed the Graatne,Though sworn to be my bride?His sword shall sooner pierce ray heatt,Than reave me of thy charms—And clasp’d her to his throbbing breast,Fast lock’d within bis arms.I spoke to try thy love, she said,I’ll ne re wed man but thee ;The grave shall be my bridal bed,If Graeme my husband be^Take then, dear youth, this faitljful ki?s.In witness of my troth,And every plague become my lot,That day I break my oath.-They parted thus-—the sun was set—Up hasty Donali^ flies ;And turn thee, turn thee, beardless youth,He loud insulting cries.Soon turn’d about the fearless chief,And soon his sword he drew;For Donald’s blade before his breast,Had pierc'd his tartans through.This for my brother’s slighted love,His wrongs sit on my prm—Three paces back the youth retir’d,To save himself from harm.. b'okTta hnirn vdj rnoit 1Returning swift, his pweyd he rear’d,Fierce Donald’s head abpye;And through the brain and crashing bone,His lurious weapon drove.yjnfAcmi oJ ojm liai!!ifLife issued at the wound—he fellA lump of lifeless clay ;So fall my foes, quoth valiant Rose,And stately strode away.Thro’ the green wood in haste he pass’d,.

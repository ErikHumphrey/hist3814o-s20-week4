SOLDIER’S RETURN.When wild war’s deadly blast was blowrAnd gentle peace returning,And eyes again wi’ pleasure beam’d.That had been blear’d wi’ mourning ; :I left the lines, and tented fieldsWhere lang I’d been a lodger,A humble knapsack a’ my wealth*A poor, but honest sodger.A lee light heart beat in my breast,My hands unstain’d wi’ plunder j5And for fair Scotia hame again,. 1 cheery on did wander :I thought upon the banks o* Coil,I thought upon my Nancy,I thought upon the witching smile,That caught my youthful fancy.At length I reached the bonny glen,Where early life 1 sported,I past the mill, and trysting thorn.Where Nancy oft 1 courted ;Wha spied 1 but my ain dear maidDown by her mother’s dwelling,I turn’d me round to hide the floodThat in my e’e was swelling.Wi’ alter’d voice, quoth I, sweet lass,Sweet as yon hawthorn’s blossom,O happy, happy, may he be,That’s dearest to thy bosom ;My purse is light, I’ve far to gang,And fain would be thy lodger ;I’ve serv’d my king and country lang,Tak pity on a sodger.Sae wistfully she gaz’d on me.And lovelier grew than ever jQuoth she, a sodger ance I lo’ed,Forget him shall I never ;Our humtle cot and hamely fare,Ye freely shall partake o’t;That gallant badge the dear cockade,Ye’re welcome for the sake o’t.-MO'ttsr.<5She gazM—she recMerft? liKfe a rose -Syne pale as ony lily,She sank vvithin my arms ahd cried,Art then my airi dear

heave the lead the seamen sprung,And to the pilot cheerly sung.By the deep nine.Now bearing up to gain the port.Some well-known object kept in view.An abbey tower, an harbour fort,Or beacon to the vessel true :While oft the lead the seamen flung,And to the pilot cheerly sung, 'By the mark seven.And as the much loved shore we near.With transport we behold the roof.Where dwells a friend and nartner dear,^ Of faith and love a matchless proof.T he lead once more the seamen flung,Then to the watchful pilot sung,Quarter less five.Now to their birth the ship draws nigh.We shorten sail, she feels the tide.Stand clear the cable, is the cry.The anchor’s gone—we safely ride.The watch is set, and through the night,We hear the sentry, with delight,Proclaim—-all’s well.CHARLIE HE’S MY

danger free ;He marks some vessel’s dusky form,And hears amid some howling storm,The minute gun at sea.Swift on the shore a hardy few,The lif**-l>oat man with a gallant crew,And dare the dangerous wave;Through the wild surf they cleave their way,Lo>t in the foam, nor know dismay,For they go the crew to save.21But oh what rapture fills each breastOf the hapless crew of the ship distress’d.Then landed safe what joy to tellOf all the dangers that befel,Then heard is no more,By the watch on the shore.The minute gun at sea.A RED RED ROSE.O my luve’s like a red roseThat’s newly sprung in June,0 my love’s like the melodie,That’s sweetly play’d in tune.As fair art thou my bonny lass,As deep in love am I ;And I will love thee still my dear,Till a’ the seas gang dry.Till a’ the seas gang dry, my dear,And the rocks melt wi’ the sun,1 will love thee still my dear,While the sands o’ life shall run.O SWIFTLY GLIDES.O swiftly glides the bonny boat,Just started from the shore,22And to the fisher’s chorus note,Soft moves the dipping- oar.His toils are borne with happy cheerAnd ever may they speed ; 'That feeble age, and helpmate dearAnd tender bairnies feed. 'We cast our lines m Largo bay,Our nets aie flowing wide.Our bonny boat, with yielding sway,Rocks lightly on the tide.And happy prove our daily lot,Upon the summer sea jAnd blest on land our kindly cot.Where all our treasures be.The mermaid on her rock may sing,^ The witch may Weave her charm jNor water-sprite, nor eldrich thing.The bonny boat can harm.It safely bears its scaly store.Thro many a stormy gale,W hile joyful shouts rise from the shore.Its homeward prey to hail !We cast our lines, &c.Thic Bush 4boon TRAQuam.Hear me ye nymphs and every swain.Til tell how Peggy grieves me;Tho’ thus I languish thus complainAlas, she ne’er believes me,My vows and sighs like silent airUnheeded never move her,At the bonny bush aboon Traquair,’Twas there I first did love her.J hat day she smil’d and made me glad,No maid seem’d ever kinder j1 thought myself the luckiest lad.So sweetly there to find her.I tried to sooth my am’rous flame,In words that I thought tender ;If more there passed, I’m not to blame,I meant not to offend her.Yet now she scornful flies the plain.The fields vve then frequented ;If e’er vve meet she shews disdain,She looks as ne’er acquainted.The bonny bush bloom’d fresh in May,It’s sweets Til ay remember,But now her frowns make it decay,It fades as hi December.Ye rural powers who hear my strains,Why thus should Peggy grieve me ?O ! make her partner in my pains,Then let her smiles relieve me.If not, my love will turn despair.My passion no more tender iI’ll leave the hush aboon Tiaquair,To lonely wilds Til wander.24BLACK EY’D SUSAN*Ai.l in the Downs the fleet was moor’d,The streamers waving to the wind,When black-ey’d Susan came on board,O ! where shall I my true love find ?Tell me, ye jovial sailors, tell me true.If my sweet William sails among your crew, iWilliam, who, high upon the yard.Rock’d with the billows to and fro,Soon as her well-known voice he heard,He sigh’d, and cast his eyes below ;The cord flies swiftly through his glowing handsAnd quick as lightning on the deck he standsO Susan, Susan, lovely dear !My vows shall ever true remain ;Let,me kiss off that falling tear;We only part to meet again. ~ ‘Change as ye list, ye winds ! my heart shall blThe faithful compass that still points to thee.The boatswain gave the dreadful word,The sails their swelling bosom spread ;No longer must she stay aboard :They kiss’d—-she sigh’d, be hung his headHer less’m'ng boat unwilling rows to land :Adieu ! she crie«, and waiv’d her lilv hand.

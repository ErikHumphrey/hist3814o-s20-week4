if I were a litle bird,To build upon his breast ;Or if I were a Nightingale,To sing my love to rest;To gaze upon his lovely eyesAll my reward should be,For I love my love, because I knowMy love loves me.Oh ! if I were an eagle,To soar into the sky !I’d gaze around with piercing eyes.Where I my love might spy ;But ah! unhappy maiden !That love you ne’er shall see,Yet I love my love, because I knowMy love loves me.5The Farmer.Come each jolly fellow that loves to be mellow.Attend unto me and sit easy ;One jorum in quiet, my boys wewill try it,Dull thinking will make a man crazy;For here I am king, let drink, laugh, and' sing,Let no man, appear as a stranger;But show me the ass that refuses liis glkss,And I’ll order him hay in a manger.By plowing and sowing, by reaping and mowing,Dame nature supplies me With plenty ;I’ve a cellar well stor’d, and a plentiful, board,'And my garden affords every dainty ;I have all things in season, both woodcock andpheasant; ,I am here as justice of Quorum ,, jIn my cabin’s far end, I’ve a bed for a friend,• With a clean fire side and a jorum.Were it not for my seeding, you’d get but .poorfeeding; ‘ ' ,You would surely be all starv’d without meI am always content when I’ve paid my rent.And happy when friends are about me ;Draw close to the table, my bays, Whiiie yoa’re able.Let me hear no words of complaining.For the jingling of glasses all music surpasses,I love to see bottles a draining.Let the mighty and great red! in splendour and state,I envy them not, I declare it;I’ll eat rny own Iamb, my own chickens a«d hem,And 1 11 shear my own sheep, and I’ll wear it..I’ve lawns and I've bowers, I have fruit abd l.Yeflowers.The lark is my daily alarmer ;| So my jolly boys, now, that follow the plough, •Drink Long Life and Success to the Farmer.The Bonny House of Airley.It fell on a day, and a bonny summer day,Wtoen ihe corn grew green and barely.That there fell out a great disputeBetween Argy.le and Airley.Argyle has raised .a 'hundred njcn,A nunored men and mairfey.And he has gone to tlje back of Di^nkeld,To plunder the bonny tioifse'pf Airley.The Lady look’d over her window.And oh !• she [look’d uricheerly.And ishe-^spy’d the great ArgyleComing to plunder the,bonny house of Airley.Come dbwh, c6mec'down, Madam, he soys,Come down and kiss^ me fairly ;I will not kiss thee, great Argyle,If you’d-not leave a standingstone in Airley.He has tae’n her by the middle so smah,' Saiys, Lady, where is ybur dowry ?It is up ond down, the bonny buxn-side.Among the pla'ntitfgs ofAirlhVi.They sought it ,up, they bought it tl.own.They sou^it it late and early.And found-it; in the bonny palm-tree,That shines ou the bowliug+green of Airley,He has tae’n her by the left-shoulder.And O but she look'd qheerlyv ^And laid her down on the green bank,Till ho plundet'd the bonny house of Airley.Q !

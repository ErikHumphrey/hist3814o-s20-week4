It was then stronglyremarked in her, that she made observations onpeople’s features and manners; would sit up wholenights when the atmosphere was clear, and seemedas intent on considering the stars, as the greatestastrologers would bo with their glasses; this gaveher a great knowledge of the weather, the alteration of the air, and the ettect it had ; and from hersometimes casually acquainting the neighbouringfarmers of any change which generally took place,her fame began to spread when young, and she wasconsulted by them on almost every occasion ; nota farmer would go to plough, not a sown- wouldput the seed in the ground, without first asking theyoung gipsey (for so they then styled her) heropinion, and following according to her dictates.Her fame now began to spread, and Bridget’sprescience became more universal; other personsbesides farmers and her neighbours came to con¬sult her, and the truth of her perdictions made herveracity gain ground, and she became the topic ofconversation of the politest circles, many of whomcame in their equipages to consult her; and shenever asked for any particular sum, so the un¬bounded generosity of those who applied to heroracles, put her in possession of more money thanwas sufficient to maintain her.As she grew in years, like the generality ot old0folks, she became fond of dumb animals, which wereher chief companions ; and of these she always hadnumbers; people, indeed, have said hundreds, and! others have declared she could call as many on theearth as she pleased ; but this is fabulous, for I ne¬ver saw more than ten at a time. Dogs and catswere the principal companions of her retirement,which, being of the smallest breed, would, as she sat.creep from different parts of her garments, and nota little surprise those that came to see her, and,indeed, frightened many ; though, to do her justice,she desired her visitors not to bo terrified at her do-: mestics, as she termed them, for they were not likemany that attended on the gentry, saucy, imperious,I and unfaithful, but were always attendant on thowill of her whose hand fed them, nor would injure1 without provocation, a lesson, she used to say, she' wished was learned by all mankind.Of a pipe of tobacco our Bridget was exceeding¬ly ly fond, and, indeed, was continually whiffing; and5 as she indeed, humourously used to observe, she had“ sent more puffs into the world, than all the quacksi» the kingdomfrom a long contracted habit,likewise, when she was smoking, of ever beingseated so that her knees almost touched her visage,her limbs became so contracted, that when she be¬came in years, she was almost double, which, to¬gether with her enormous length of nose and chin,her pipe, and the number of animals about her,l made her cut a most hideous figure, and appeari rather uncommonly terrifying to those who werea not apprised of it.6Though this famous old woman had nevertaught to write, jet by long practice she had form¬ed to herself a kind of hjeroglypliical character?, ipwhich-she decyphered her observations, knowledge,and remarks; these I found concealed within thethatclj. of her cave ; but a? they WfiFh s9 ulliutPU'si-ble, I thought it would he hnpp.^siblp tq matehead or tale of such a heap of monstprs, and otherfigure? as were attempted tQ be draw?} ; but as | amratlier of a studious turn, I thought a?

Thinkof my joy f not the miser who has found a treasuryhe supposed lost: not a maiden who finds her loverreturned after a long voyage, whom she thoughtperished in the waves, hut finds restored to herarms with love and fidel ty: not—hut a truce withmetaphors it is enough t.q tell the reader th^t |was at length enabled to read this valuable worjt,and found by experience, that the maxims and rg:marks, her observations and judgement, have Uegpextensive, are true, strongly characteristic, andwould do honour to the most experienced astrolo¬gers.Nature sometimes in her roughest coat dropsher brightest jejvel, which for a long time lies hidtill de eloped hr some experienced adept. So wemay observe of our authoress, that though cloth¬ed in the meanest garb, nature showed herself ini her abilities, and left it for me to hand down toposterity what otherwise would be lost in obli¬vion.Thinking, therefore, so precious a jewel shouldnot remain long hid, but shed its lustre to all eyes,I immediately set about putting it into English ;which at length I have accomplished, and usher itinto the world, requesting the gentle reader to excuse my literal errors ; and if he reaps any benefitfrom this production, I shall not think my labourill bestowed, though all the merit is due to thedeceased authoress.< ■■'1 • t fTHE TRUEFORTUNE TELLER.An Explanation of the Circles of the Sphere, andsome other Terms of Astrology, for the easier Un¬derstanding of this Booh, and further informationof the Reader.Tire Equinoctial circle, Equator, or Equinox, isa great circle or line, equally distant from the twopoles of tho world, dividing the sphere in themidst.Zodiac is a broad oblique circle, crossing theequinoctial in two opposite places, viz., in the be¬ginning of Aries and that of Libra, so that onehalf declines towards the south ; and in this circleis comprehended the twelve constellations or signs,every sign containing thirty degrees in length, andtwelve in breadth. Note also, that the first six arenorthern signs, and the last six southern signs.The Ecliptic line, is a line imagined to go alongin the midst of the Zodiac as a girdle, out of whichthe sun never goes; but the moon and other planetsare sometimes on the one side, and sometimes onthe other side, which is called their latitudes, onlythe fixed stars alter not their latitudes, whethergreat or small; but the longtitude of a star is thearch, or parts of the ecliptic in degrees, between thebeginning of Aries, and the circle which passeththrough the body of the stars ; where note, that9all the circles of the sphere, or heavens, whetherthey are large or small, have 360 degrees allowedto each of them.Colours are said to ho two great moveable cir-tdes, crossing each other at the poles of the world,one cutting the equinox at the beginning of Aries,Cancer, and Capricorn, and so dividing the globeinto four equal parts.Horizon is a great circle which divideth the up-i per hemisphere, that is, the upper part of the world,from the lower, we always being supposed to bebetween.Meridian is a great circle passing through thepole of the world, and the poles of the horizon,called the Zenith and Nadir, (which are two points,one directly over our heads, the other directly un¬der our feet) on which the sun is always just atf noon, and to go directly north and south, the me¬ridian is changed ; but to go to east and west, it ischanged to sixty miles, either way makes one de¬gree, or four minutes of time difference under theequinox, viz. 60 miles eastward, it is noon fourminutes sooner, and sixty miles westward, fourminutes later.Tropics are supposed to be two lesser circles,parallel with the equinoctial, and distant from it on“ither side 23 degrees 31 minutes each ; the eclip¬tic line touches the tropics of Cancer on the northside of the equinoctial, and it touches the tropicsof Capricorn on the south side thereof, so that thesun hath his motion between these two circles.The Arctic circle is equally distant from thenorth pole, as the tropics are distant from the equi¬nox—23 degrees 31 minutes.The .Antarctic circle is the same distance fromthe south pole.Zones, so called, are five in number, two cold,two temperate, and one hot, which are divided bythe tfopios au«l p^lar circles from eacli other; thehot zone is counted between the two tropics thatare extended from one tc the other, being about 47degrees 2 minutes broad; the temperate zones areextended from the tropics, on either side, to about42 degrees 58 minutes, that is northward to thearticle circle, and southward to the antarctic ci roleand the two cold zones are each within those t« <small circles, having the poles for their centro.The Poles of the world—two points exact! v <>pposite to each other in the heavens, one in t!u-north, the other in the south, the earth being mthe midst, so that it seems to turn about as if iiwore borne up by them; therefore by some it. i.-termed the axle-tree of the world, as if there wn>a lino supposed to be drawn from one pole throughtho centre of the earth to the other, and the cartturning thereon; though Holy Writ tells us-—“ The Lord hangeth the earth upon nothing, itbeing upheld by his mighty power.” The pulearctic, or north pole, is elevated above our horiznuabout 51 degrees, and the stars within that di—tauco from it never set with us, but keep theircourse round it daily; so likewise those that arethat distance from the south pole never rise withus. hut perform their course in the like order.Azimuths are supposed lines, or circles of dis¬tance from the meridian, drawn from the zenith toany degree, or two degrees of the horizon, or ac¬cording to the 32 points of the mariner's compass,so that in travelling or sailing any way, supposinga circle to go from our zenith directly before us tothe horizon, is the azimuth, called the verticalpoint, as well as the zenith.Almicantharats, or Almadarats, or circles of Al¬titude, are imagined lines passing through the me¬ridian parallel with the horizon.The Sphere is a round body representing theliframe of the whole world, as the circle of the hea¬ven and the earth. This is sometimes called amartial sphere, for the orbs of the planets are called their spheres, that is, the circles in which theymove.Ascension is the rising of any star, or any partof the ecliptic above the horizon—Dcscension isits going down.Right ascension of a star, is that part of the equinox that riseth or sctteth with a star in the rightsphere ; but an oblique sphere, is that part of the•quinoctial in degrees, containing between the firstpoint of Aries, and that part of the equinoctialwhich passcth by the meridian with the centre ofthe star.Oblique ascenison is a part of the equinoctial indegrees containing between the beginning of Ariesand that of the equinox, which rises with any staror part of the ecliptic in an oblique sphere.Essential difference is the difference between theright and oblique ascension, or the number of de¬grees contained between that place and the equi¬nox that riseth with the centre of a star, and thatplace of the equinox that cometh to the meridianwith the same star.Solstice is in the summer when the sun is in thebeginning of Cancer: and in the winter when thesun enters into Capricorn: because then the daysseem to stand still, and seem neither to increase ordecrease above two minutes in ten or twelve days.Constellation is a certain number of stars suppos¬ed to be limited within some form or likeness ; asfuries the Ram is said to have thirteen stars;—Taurus the Bull, thirty-three ; Arcturus, Orion,anc} the Pleiades, mentioned in Job, ix. 9, are saidto be constellatiads.Planets are the seven cratique, or wandering stars,tailed Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Venus, Mercury,12Sol, and Luna. These planets have also their se¬veral motions, as—Direct, is a planet moving in its natural course,which is forward.Retrograde, is their moving backward, contraryto their direct motion.Combust is their being under the sun’s beams, orwithin eight degrees of it.Oriental, is when a planet riseth before the sun,—Occidental, after him.Latitude of the earth is the distance or breadthon either side of the equinox towards the pole, andthey that are under the equinox have no latitude,but the poles of the world are in the horizon. Thisis a right sphere, and every 60 minutes directlynorth and south, are said to make a degree of la¬titude in an oblique sphere ; as London is countedto be in 51 degrees 32 minutes, the pole thereofbeing exalted as much. The like is to be observedm any other place or region.Longitude of the earth is the outside thereof,extending from west to east, crossing the latitude atright angles ; the beginning of which (accordingto some astronomers) is the Canary Isles, so goingeastward quite round the world, unto the same placeagain, which is 360 degrees: and under the equi¬noctial is reputed to be 29,600 miles, reckoning60 miles to a degree ; but the farther off the equi¬noctial the fewer miles in a degree ; for at Londonabout 37 make a degree of longitude, so these de¬grees grow less and less, until they meet at the la¬titude of 90, that is under the poles.Parallels—the lines straight and circular, equallydistant from each other, as the equinox, tropics,degrees of latitude, &c.Climate, or clime, is such a space of earth com¬prehended between two parallels, in which spacethere is half an hour difference in the sun dials andlength of the days.Antipodes are those whose feet are directlyiigainst ours ; as if a line were drawn from onethrough the centre of the earth to the other.: And this shall suffice for an explanation of things,vhich I have done as briefly as I could for theAdvantage of the reader; to whom possibly, thesethings so necessary to be known, may have hither-l*o been concealed.\)f the Planetary Lays and Lours, and how to knowwluit Planet a Man is born under.The planetary hours are those hours in which eachplanet reigns, and has the chief dominion ; of whichhe anoients gave the following account.I Saturn is lord on Saturday—Jupiter lord onThursday—Mars is lord on Tuesday—Sol is lord.mu Sunday—Mercury on Wednesday—Venus onp’riday—and Luna on Monday.I On Saturday, the first hour after midnight, Sa-uirn reigns, the second Jupiter, the third Mars,ijhe fourth. Sol, the fifth Venus, the sixth Mercury,hnd the seventh Luna ; and then again Saturn theight, and so on to Mars the 24th ; and then Sol•eginneth the first hour after midnight on Sunday,lenus the 2d, and so on ; Luna the first on Mon-lay, and Saturn the 2d ; Mars the first on Tuesday,Sol the 2d, and so forward, planet by planet, accord-tig to their order, by which every planet reigns theirst hour of his own day: and so likewise theighth, fifteenth, and twenty-second; as for instancesaturn reigns the first hour, the eighth, fifteenth,nd twenty-second, on Saturday, Sol the sametours on Sunday, Luna the same on Monday, Marshe same on Tuesday, Mercury the same on Wed¬nesday, Jupiter the same on Thursdav, and sorenus on Fridav, which 1 have thus set.Of the Planetary Hour of every Day in the Week.Sunday Monday TuesdaySaturn :5 12 19 j2 9 10 23,0 13 20Jupiter |G 13 20Mars <7 14 21 4 1118Sol 1 8 15 225 12 T>Venus 2 9 10 23 0 13 2'tMercury 3 10 17 247 14 21Luna 4 11 18 l 8 15 223 10 17 2417 14 21It 8 15 222 9 10 233 30 17 244 11 185 12 19Wednesday Thursday3 10 17 247 14 214 11 1812 190 13 207 14 21128 15 229 103 10 17 2411 188 15 225 12 199 10 23'8 13 20Friday4 11 1812 190 13 207 14 211 8 15 222 9 10 233 10 17 247 14 21Saturdayl 8 15 229 10 2310 17 2411 1812 1913 20This is so easy it needs little explanation ; its use is to find what planet rules any hour of theday and every day in the week. As for example—I desire to know what planet rules on Wed¬nesday, at 8 o’clock at night: under Wednesday 1 look for 20, which answers to 8 o’clock at night;for the natural day, consisting of 24 hours begins at midnight, so that from 12 at noon you beginto reckon 13, 14, 15, 10, &c. you find that the 20th hour from midnight answers to 8 o’clock atnight, over against which, on the left hand, you find Sol, which shows that to be the hour of thesun. And if you would know what planet rules at 7 in the morning of that day, you will find itagainst 7, which shows you that Venus rules that hour ; and so of any hour in the day-ioBut I shall now come to speak of the significa¬tion of the planetary hour of each planet, and whatf it portends to them that are born in them.The hour of Saturn is strong, is good to do allthings that require strength ; such as fighting, bear¬ing burdens, and the like ; but for those things it isvery evil. He that is born in the hour of Saturn isslow, dull, and melancholy, of dogged temper anddisposition, black and swarthy complexion, being' quarrelsome, wrathful, and very malicious.The hour of Jupiter is in all things good, arid| denotes peace, love, and concord. He that is bornin the hour of Jupiter is of a ruddy and sandy com¬plexion, fair hair, well-proportioned body, and of a! lovely countenance ; his face rather broad thanlong. He is also courteous, of a very affable car¬riage, moral, and religious.The hour of Mars is evil, and denotes the per¬son born in it to be of a choleric disposition, andj of a robust strong body, soon angry, and hard toI be reconciled ; his face red, and his eyes sparklingi and fiery, much addicted to fighting, and ready toI quarrel with every man he meets, which oftenbrings him to an untimely end.The hour of the Sun signifies great strength,very fortunate for kings and princes. He that isborn in this hour has sharp eyes, brown hair, anda round face, denotes one that is a great projector,aims at great things, but is often disappointed, aridseldom brings his design to passThe hour of Venus is very propitious and for¬tunate, but it is better by night than by day, es¬pecially mid-day, for the sun covers it. He thatis born in this hour has fair hair, soft eyes, a littleforehead, and a round beard, very complaisant inhis carriage, mighty amorous, a great admirer ofwomen, much addicted to singing and gaming,and spends his money in courting and treating thefair sox.16The hour of Mercury is very good, but chieflyfrom the beginning to the middle. He that is born>n this hour, has stature inclining to tallness, asharp long face, large eyes, a long nose, his fore¬head narrow, a long beard, and thin hair, long armand fingers, of a good disposition, and obligingtemper, much given to reading, and very desir¬ous of knowledge, delighting to be among books,very eloquent in his speech, and yet addicted tolying, and if he is poor, lie is commonly light fin¬gered.The hour of the moon is both good and evil,according to the dav : for from the fourth to theseventeenth it is good to those that are bora underit; but from the seventeenth to the twentieth it iscounted unfortunate to be born under it : and fromthe twentieth to the twenty-seventh very happy.He that is born in the hour of the moon (especiallyupon her own day) shall be pale faced, of a thinmeagre visage, with hollow eyes, and of a middlingstature ; he appears very courteous and obliging,but is very crafty and deceitful, variable in hishumour, malicious, and his constitution phlegmatic.Thus have I given the reader the judgment ofancients upon the planetary hours, and what theyportend to those that are born under them, bywhich a person, comparing himself to what is hereset down, may easily know under what planet hewas born.Of the Birth of Children icith respect to the Ac/e ofthe Moon.To be born the first day of the new moon, isvery fortunate, for to such all things shall succeedwell; their sleep will he sweet, and their dreamspleasant ; thov shall have long life and increase ofriches.17A child born the second day of the new mooni shall grow apace; but it will be much inclined toI lust, Yhetfm' it be male or female. On this day(also, all thy dreams shall quickly come to pass,j whether they be good or bad. It is also good onf this day to open a vein if there be occasion.A child bom on the third day of the moon shallS die soon, or at least short-lived ; on this day to be-|, gin any work of moment is unfortunate, for it sel-, dom comes to a good conclusion.! On the fourth day of the moon the child that hborn shall prosper in the tvorld, and be of goodrepute. On this day it is good to begin any en¬terprise, provided it be done with good advice,and with dependence on Heaven for a blessing.The fifth day of the moon is unfortunate; andthe child that is bom therein shall die in its infancy.He that is in danger, and thinks to escape this dayshall certainly be mistaken. If good counsel begiven thee to-day take it, but execute it to-morrow.This day thou may let blood with good success.The sixth day of the moon the child that is born‘-hall be of long life, but very sickly. To sendchildren to school on this day is very fortunate,and denotes they shall increase in learning.On the seventh day the child that is born maylive many years; on this day it is good to shavethe head, to tame wild beasts, and buy hogs, for hethat doth so shall gain much by them, he that takesphysic this day is like to recover.On the eighth day a child bom shall be in dangerof dying young ; but if he survives his first sickness,he shall live long and arrive at a great estate. Hethat dreams a dream shall quickly have it come topass. Any thing that is lost shall be found.On the ninth day the child that shall be bornshall be very fortunate, enjoying long life, and ar¬riving to great riches. What thou undertakest this18day shall come to a good issue ; he that is pursuedshall escape ; and he that groans under the burdenof oppression, shall be opportunely relieved. I)onot let blood on this day, for it is dangerous.On the tenth day a child that is born shall be agreat traveller, pass through many kingdoms andregions, and at last die at home in his old age. Donothing on this day but what you would have known,for all secrets shall be brought to lightOn the eleventh day of the moon the child thatis born shall be of a good constitution, and be mighti¬ly devoted to religion, shall be long-lived, and of alovely countenance ; and if it be a female, she shallbe endowed with wisdom and learning. On thisday it is good to marry, for the married couple shallbe happy all their lives, and be blessed with manychildren.The twelfth day of the moon’s age, in allusion tothe twelfth sign of the Zodiac, betokeneth no¬thing but sorrow and woe : and the child born thisday shall be given to wrathfulness, and subject tomany afflictions.On the thirteenth day the child that is born shallbe of a short life, and by reason of peevish crossnessnever be pleased. To wed a wife on this day isgood, for she shall be both loving and obedient toher husband.On the fourteenth day the child that is born shallbe an enemy to his country, and seek the destruc¬tion of his prince, which shall bring him to his de¬served end. On this day if you give to a sick manphysic, it sliall restore him to his former health.On the fifteenth day the child that is bom shallquickly die. On this day begin to work for it isfortunate. That which was lost yesterdav will befound this day.On the sixteenth day the child born shall be ofill manners, and very unfortunate, insomuch thttf19f though he may live long, yet his life will be a bur-! den to him. It is not good to dream on this dayI for they are commonly hurtful, and such as come1 to pass a long time after.On the seventeenth day the child that shall heborn will be foolish to that degree, that it shall healmost a natural, and thereby become a great afflic¬tion to its parents ; yet to contract matrimony, com¬pound physical preparations, and take physic is verygood ; but by no means let blood., On the eighteenth day the child that shall beborn, if male, will be violent, courageous, and elo¬quent ; and if female, chaste, industrious, and beau¬tiful, and shall come to honour in her old age.On the nineteenth day the child then born, if aI male, shall be renowned for wisdom and virtue, and| thereby arrive to great honour : but if a female, shewill be of a weak and sickly constitution, yet shewill live to be married.On the twentieth day the child that shall be bornshall be stubborn, quarrelsome, and a great fighter,yet he shall arrive to riches and a great store ofmoney.On the one and twentieth day the child that isborn will be unhappy, and though he will be wittyand ingenious, yet he shall be addicted to stealing.He that is minded to keep his money, ought onthis day to abstain from gaming, else he maychance to lose all. Abstain from bleeding thisday.On the twenty-second day the child born shallbe fortunate and purchase a good estate ; he shallalso be of a cheerful countenance, comely, and reli¬gious, and shall be ■well loved.On the three and twentietli day the child bornshall be of an ungovernable temper, and will givehimself up to wandering abroad in the world, andseeking hi« fortune m foreign parts, and in the endshall be mistaken. This is a good day to wed awife ; for he that can meet with a good wife oughtto marry her while he can have her.On the Twenty-fourth day the child then bornshall be a prodigy in the world, and make all menadmire his surprising wonderful actions, which shallexceed those of the ordinary sort of men.On the live and twentieth day the child then bornshall be wicked, he shall encounter witli many dan¬gers and at last will perish by them. This is anunfortunate day to those who begin any enterprizeof moment thereon.On the six and twentieth day the child that shallbe then born shall be very beautiful and amiable ;but yet of an indifferent state in the world, if it bea male ; but if it be a female, a rich man marriesher for her beauty.The twenty-seventh day the child that shall beborn shall be of that sweet and affable temper anddisposition, that it will contract the love of everyone with whom it shall converse : and yet if a maleshall never rise to any great height in the world ;but if a maiden, the sweetness of her dispositionmay advance her, for such a temper is to be esteem¬ed above riches.On the twenty-eighth day the child that is bornshall be the delight of his parents, but yet subjectto much sickness and many distempers, which shalltake it away before it is at perfect age.On the twenty-ninth day the child that shall beborn shall be fortunate and happy, blessed with longlife, and attain to an eminent degree of holiness,wisdom, and virtue. To marry a good wife is agood fortune, and such shall be his that shall marryon this day.On the thirtieth day the child that shall be bornwill be fortunate and happy, and well skilled in artsand sciences21These, and divers other like things, happen tomankind according to the different ages and coursesof the moon, which has a great influence upon all| human bodies.I will, therefore, for the advantage and benefitof my readers, treat a little more distinctly of thepowers and influences of the heavenly bodies, asthey are laid down by ancient and modern astro¬logers, who have written upon that subject morelargely.iA brief Prognostication concerning Children bornon any day of the Week.i The child born on Sunday shall be of a long lifeand obtain riches.On Monday. Weak and of an effemiaate tem¬per, which seldom brings a man to honour.On Tuesday. Worse, though lie may with ex-traordinarv violence, conquer the inordinate desiresto which he will be subject, still he will be in dan¬ger of dying by violence, if he has not great pre¬caution.On Wednesday. Shall be given to the study oflearning, and shall profit thereby.On Thursday. He shall arrive at great honourand dignity.On Friday. He shall be of a strong constitution,and perhaps lecherous.On Saturday.

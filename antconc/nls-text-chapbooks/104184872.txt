Provifions beingfcirce on theEnglifh fide in thofe borders,this report made his men fo forward, thatthey defired they might go out in parties,and bring as much as they could get awayundifeovered; but he.defpifing fuch a waythat looked too much like dterdleahng,told them, if their courage was fuffioientto venture for it fairly, he would venturewith them; and id hunting it down asa fair game, it ihould be brought off withhorn ur, as a lawful prize, taken in anenemy’s country : For then K Henry II.of England, in whofe reign it happened,was >t war with the Scots, the.’ there hadbeen, fra while, an iiiervai, or ceffationof arms T this m lien cf the nobleEarl’s, they gave their unanimous ecu -( 4 )fent, by throwing up their caps, witha loud fhout. And fo the Earl 'madea vow, that for three days he would takehis p’eafure in hunting in Ghevychafe.And, thereup rt, fending for his dogs andtoils, early on a midfummer morning,they piffed the Tweed; and w^ere bya guide directed to the place, which wasabout fix tniies nearer Edinburgh.Sp to the game they went; cite d 'gswere put fa toroufe the harts; the hornsfounding, the huntfrnen’s ihoo*«, withthe noife of the d gs, alarmed all theCountry round. The villagers thinkingit had been the f und of war, or fome•fuddeu invalion, were fo terrified, thatmany of them fled with what they couldcarry away, for fear of being plundered;and with their greundlefs fears put thewhole neighbourhood, for many miles,into confternation and confufion !The harts and roes, thoVlVift in theirrunning, could n t‘ however, outflrip theEng’ilh archers, they laying fome fcoresof them on the ground. They killed fomany, that they knew not how to getthem carried off; fuch was their fuccefsin hunting the firft day. At night, theykindled great fires, and roafled the fatfides and haunches; with which theyrefreIbed thejnfelves.{ s )Bat, whllft the Earl was at fupperWKh divers K. ights. ’Squires and Gen¬tlemen, on a table of b ards laid m furporters rf turf, and frting on feats railedon a turf bank, inch accommodation asthe rural place cnulH aff rc; at the clofeit, and juft as he was about to giveorders to the huntfrnen to begin the fport. e next “crning with the fun-rifintr!n Cime a mefletiger dreffed in fcarl-tbvery, laced with gold, and a badge ofarms on a plate of filver, faftened on hisbreaft; which fhewed him to be fert bv«me perf.n of qitaiity. Whereupon, -the Earl commanding hlence, demandedinm whence he came, and what hisbufine.s was. Upon which he thusbegan, with a haughty mein :‘ o;r,” faid he, “ whoever you areI know not, but my Maher, the noble, va-liant and always vift -rious Earl Douglaschief Ranger to the King of Scotlsnd, andto whom thefe Parks and Chafes belon-heanng you have boldly prefumed t>enter them, and deftroy his deer, withoUrlesve or confent, by me tells y that1 y,?U du ”ot ^lfl‘'-enly ocpart, ycur livesfhal‘ W ** the injury you Laveoeiore tc-morruw noonl’5This being denounced, he was aboutto depart; but the undaunted EarlPiercy,taking him by thefbcve, faid,“ Sir, It is proper you iliould carryan anfwer back to your Lord; and thatis this: Tell him my name isPiercy;a name at which Scotland has trembled !and that I am of fo true EnglWh courage,that threats are in vain to “e rify me.—Tell him, moreover, I have propofed totake ray pteafure in thefe Forefts andChafes.far two days longer; and if hebe f:> valiant .as you Ly, let him hinderray fport, if.he be fo bold as to attempt it,at the haztrd of his life,”Upon this, the mtfilnger departedwith fpeed to the Scotch Earl, who layat Edinburgh, and related what wasgiven him in charge by Earl Piercy:At which the Scotch Earl raged, walkingup and down, threatening all mannerof punilhments < n thofe he Ihould takeprif ners; and enquired particularly thenumber of the EngiiOi, but the meffengercould give him mj certain account, onlygueffed there might lie about ten or twelvehundred men, for many < f them were indibant parts of the foi'eH, v/hen he deli¬vered his meSjge.( 7 )Whereupon he ordered his htrfe andarmour (which were overlaid with geld)to he get ready againfc miming light;a’fo all his friends and fervants, togetherwith as many as made up two thoufandfpearmen, to te muftered without lettingthem knew what defign he had in hand,:However, they difputed not to • bey him,.having, next the King, the chief com¬mand of the kingdom.The Eari if Northumberland, tho’ inan enemy’s country, and far from snyduccour, yet relying on his own and thecourage cf his men (the choiceft archers«>f England) was fu far from being daunted,1 tho’ he might reafonably expedt a greaternumber againft him, he ordered .* e tablesto be fpread a fecond time, and ftore ofwine went round, which they hzd broughtwith them in great plenty. Healths went; round, to the King, the Ear!, anil to the' profperity of their fport the next day|;and then, feiting fcouts for their protec¬tion thro’ the night, repofed themfelves.The fun no focner glided the horizon,w ith his vays, and the early lark mountedrn Ngh-, tuned her melodious n<tes, uianMie fport was renewed; and the wood?,iorefc, plains and liills, refounded withvr.e pleaftiig noife of hounds, fothat, al-!*together, they mr\r a rnrious harnidfiv'f'h.h m ruing, they killed a very ftatel?hart, the largeft that had been feen itithe .kingdom!

Their number wascomputed about two thoufaikl. Uponthis, Piercy took a leading Half in litil.aod, and a truly fword by his fide, andcan fid his men move fir ward by fl wpaces, whiiii he marched m the front.—By this time Douglas being come withinfirthy paces, Ifirnly demanckd whofe.rnsn they were, that durft lu boldly pre~fume to hunt in his firefl, and kill bisdeer?

But it could not be. fate hadinvolved many more lives in this quarrelthan the two Karls; f. r Witherington,a valiant Kngliiii ’Squire, Handing bythe Karl, when this combat was aboutto begin, clap: between them with hisfword, and made a Hand, faying, “ Mynoble Lord, it lhall never be t Id Henryour King, that we let you fight, whilftwe flood looking on.

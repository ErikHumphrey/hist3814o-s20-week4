And for to make ready gave no time we hear,i He ask’d but one favour, a word of his dear.When being denied, the old man with a frown,Said, soldiers can have sweethearts in every town ;. At this the young lady cried bitterly,‘May the heavens requite you for your cruelty.Young Grigor took courage and marched away,1 When the Captain viewed him, thus to him did say.For the lady that lov’d you, sir, I pity her case,1 Who’s lost such a beauty and sweet blooming face,i His lady cried out, what a wretch can he be,! Caus’d press this young man for no perjury.■His long yellow hair to his middle hangs down,' O’er his broad shoulders so fine round and round.■ Now- Grigor considering his pitiful case,1 Received the bounty, and swore the peace ;His captain unto him a furlough he gave,To see his dear Katty he once more did crave.Two lines he then sent her by a solid hand,’That he under the oak at midnight would stand.For to wait upon her, and hear her complaint,1 And there for to meet him she was wrell content.! Her vows she renewed, with tears not a few,And a gold-ring on’s finger as a token she drew,Which was not to move, come death or come life.Till that happy moment he made her his wife.She fain would go with him, but he answered no.For your parents will follow, and cause us more woe;6My Maker be witness, and this green oak, said he.That I ne’er shall enjoy a woman but thee.And there then he left her a-weeping full sore,Poor creature, she never got sight of him more.For in short time thereafter, he went to sea,And left the sight of Britain with the tear in his eye.And went to America, their orders being so.There proved a gallant soldier, and valour did show;That for his behaviour they ne’er could him blame.From a Corporal at last to a Sergeant he came.' PART HI.Being near Fort Niagara in the year fifty-nine.On the thirtieth of July as he always did incline.To frequent the green-wood, at some distant place.To breath out his sorrows, his mind to solace.Among the savage Indians, alas ! there he fell.But how he was murdered we cannot well tell.For on the next morning they found him there dead.Two Indians lay by him wanting their heads.Cut off with his broad-sword, as is understood,As there all about him was nothing but blood ;Five wounds in his body, his hair scalp’d away.His clothes, sword and pistol of all made a prey.And one of his fingers from his hand they had cut.On which was the gold-ring from his lover he got.In that very moment though in Scotland we hear,A dreadful spectre to his love did appear.As she was a-weeping under the green oak,He quickly past by her and not a word spoke,Yet, shaking his left hand, where the ring he did wear.It wanted a finger, and blood dropped there.7Whereat the young lady was struck with amaze.And rose to run after, and on him did gaze;As she knew it was Grigor, but how in that place.It made her to wonder and dread the sad case.Ifith terror and grief home she did retire,nd spent the whole night in weeping and prayer;3, early next morning she rose with the sun,nd went back to the green oak to weep all alone,or always she esteem’d that place as we hear,s on it she got the last sight of her dear ;s there she sat weeping and tearing her hair.Again the pale spectre to her did appear.And with a wild aspect it stared in her face,^hen said, O dear Katty, do not me embrace,or I’m but a spirit though shining in blood,"y body lies murdered in a foreign wood,ere’s two wounds in my body, and three in my side,ith hatchets and arrows, that’s both deep and wide,y scalp and fine hair for a premium are sold,jAnd also my finger with the ring of pure gold.hich you threw upon it as a mark of true love,love’s stronger than death, for it does remove,iBut my earnest desire it is for you, mv dear.And till you are with me I’ll still wander here.iFor this world’s but vanity, all’s but a vain show,Tis nought to the pleasures where we are to go;She went to embrace him, being void of all fright,iBut he in a moment went out of her sight.sThen home in great horror to her father did run,Crying, O ! cruel father, now what have you done ?Grigor, lov’d Grigor came to me in blood,And his body lies murdered in an American wood.He shewed me his wounds, and each bleeding sore.And therefore my pleasures on earth are no more.Her father looked at her as one being amaz’d,Then said. My dear Katty, your brains they are craz’dBut still she maintain’d it, and cried like a child.Ne’er after was seen for to laugh nor to smile;Brought to her all doctors, whose skill was in vain.But still gave opinion she was sound in the brain.Her body decoyed, her face grew wan and pale,She soar’d to her true love, beyond death’s dark vale,First her, then her mother, in one night expir’d,1 hope she enjoys the bliss she desir’d.Now. the old father cries, bereft of all joys.Though he has plenty of gold, no girls nor boys.Let all cruel parents to this take great heed.His pretty young daughter is now with the dead.

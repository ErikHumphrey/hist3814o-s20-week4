[paid,This promise of the king’s did makeFull many a yeoman bold,Attempt stout Robin Hood to take,With all the force they could :But still when any came to him,Within the gay green wood ;^fnd wanted for to speak to him,His men in order stood..ntou bjflsianns eid bnA10 .He shewed to them such martial sportWith his long bow and arrow,That they of him did give report,How that it was great sorrow,That such a worthy man as he,Should thus be put to shift;Being of late a lord ofhig-h degree,Of living quite bereft.The king to take him more and more,Sent men of mickle might ;But he and his still beat them sore,And conquer'd them in fight jOr else with love and courtesy,To him he won their hearts ;Thus still he liv’d by robbery,Throughout the northern parts.And all the country stood in dread.Of Robin and his men ;For stouter lads ne’er liv’d by bread,In those days, nor since then ;The Abbot which before I nam’d,Sought all the means he could,To have by force this rebel ta’en,And his adherents bold.11Therefore he arm'd five hundred menWith furniture complete;But the out-laws slew half of themAnd made the rest retreat:The long bow and the arrow keen.They were so used unto,That still he kept the forest greenIn spite of the proudest foe.Twelve of the Abbot's men he took,Who came to have him ta'en jWhen all the rest the field forsook,These he did entertainWith banqueting and merriment;And, having used him well,He to their landlord them safely sent,And will'd them him to tell,That if he would be pleased at lastTo beg of our good king,That he might pardon what was past,And him to favour bring :He would surrender back againThe money, which beforeWas taken by him and his menFrom him and many more.12Poor men might safely pass by him,And some that way would ebuse ;For well they knew, that to help them,He ever more did use.But where he knew a miser rich,That did the poor oppress,To feel his coin his hands did itch,He’d have it more or less.And sometimes when the highway fail’d,Then he his courage rouses ;He and his men have oft assail’dSuch rich men in their houses.So that thro‘ dread of Robin then,And his advent’rous crew,The misers kept great store of men,Which else maintain’d but few.King Richard, of that name the first,Sur-named Cceur de Lioh ;Went to defeat the Pagans curst,Who kept the coasts of Sion.The bishop of Ely, chancellor,Was the vice-roy here ;Who, like a potent emperor,Did proudly domineer.13Om chronicles of him report,That commonly he rode, [court,With a thousand horse from court toWhere he would make abode:He riding down towards the north,With his aforesaid train ;Robin and his men did issue forth,Them all to entertain.^4nd with the gallant grey goose wing,They skew’d to them such play.They made their hoi ses kick and fling.And down their riders lay.Full glad and fain the bishop was,For ail his thousand men,To seek what means he could to passFrom out of Robin’s ken.Two hundred of his* men were kill’d,And fourscore horses good ;Thirty, who did as captives yield,Were carried to the green wrood ;Which afterwards were ransomedFor twenty marks a man,The rest set spurs to horse and fledTo the town of Warrington.14The Bishop sore enraged then,Did in king Richard’s name,Muster up a power of northern men,These out-laws bold to tame:But Robin with his courtesy,So won the meanest sort,That they were loth on him to tryWhat rigour did import.So that bold Robin and his train,Did live unhurt by them,Until King Richard came,Prom fair Jerusalem :And then the talk of Robin Hood,His royal ears did fill;His grace admir’d that in the greenHe was continued still. [woodSo that the country far and near,Did give him great applause ;But none of them need stand in fear,But such as broke the laws:He wished well unto the king,And pray’d still for his health.And never practis’d any thing.Against his common-wealth.15Only because he was undoneBy the cruel clergy then ;All means that he could think upon,To vex such cruel men,He enterpris’d with hateful snleen,In which he was to blame,For fault of some to wreck his teen,On all that by him came.With wealth which he by robbery got,Eight aim-houses he built;Thinking thereby to purge the blotOf blood which he had spilt;Such was their blind devotion then,Depending on their works ;Which, if ‘twere true, we ChristiansInferior were to Turks.But to speak true of Robin Hood,And wrong him not a jot,Yet never would shed any man’s bloodThat him invaded not:Nor would he injure husbandmen,That toil at cart or plough;For well he knew were’t not for them,To live no man knew how.$The king in person, with some lords,To Nottingham did ride,To try what strength and skill affords,To crush the out-laws pride :And as he once before had done,He did again proclaim,That whosoever would take upon,To brin"’ to Nottingham,Or any place within the lands,Rebellious Robin Hood,Should be preferred in place to standWith those of noble blood.When Robin heard of the same,{u c/ ft - .* it * « 141 cm jnruWithin a little space,Into the town of Nottingham,A letter to his grace •*1T|He shot upon an arrow head,One evening cunningly ;Which was brought to the king & read,Before his majesty :The tenor of the letter was,That Robin would submit,And be true liege-man to his grace.In any thing that’s fit.T17So that his highness would forgiveHim and his merry men all;If not, he must in the green wood live,And take what chance did fall.The king would fain have pardon’d him,But that some lords did say,This precedent will much condemnYour grace another day.While that the king and lords didjstayDebating on this thing,Some of the out-laws fled awayUnto the Scottish king ;For they suppos’d if he was ta’en,Or to the king did yield,By the commons all the rest of’s train,Full quickly would be quell’d.Of more than full an hundred men,But forty tarried still,Who were resolved to stick to him,Let fortune work her will:If none had fled, all for his sakeHad got their pardon free ;The king to favour meant to takeHis merry men and he.r*»18But ere the pardon to him came,This famous archer died :His death and manner of the same,I'll presently describe;For being vex'd to think uponHis folio wers revolt,In melancholy passionHe did recount his fault.Perfidious, traitors, said he then,In all your dangers past,Have I you guarded as my men,To leave me thus at last !This sad perplexity did causeA fever, as some say,Which h im into confusion draws.Though in a stranger way.This deadly danger to prevent,He hied him with all speedInto a nunnery, with intentFor his health's sake to bleed,A faithless fair did there pretend,In love, to let him blood ;But she by falseness wrought the endOf famous Robin Hood.19The fair, as some say, did thisTo vindicate the wrongWhich to the clergy him and hisHad done by power strong.Thus died he by treachery.Who could not die by force ;Had he liv'd longer, certainlyKing Richard, in remorse,Had into favour him receiv'd,His brave men elevated:’Tis pity he was oflife bereav'd,By one that he so hated :A treacherous leech this friar was,To let him bleed to death ;And Robin was methinks an ass,To trust him with his breath.His corps the prioress of the pi ice,(The day next that he died,)Caus'd to be buried (in mean case)Close by the high-way side ;And over him she caus'd a stoneTo be fixed in the ground ;An epitaph was set thereon,Wherein his name was found.20The date of the year, and date also,She made to be set on there,That all that by that way did go,Might see it plan appear;That such a man as Robin Hood,Was buried in that place :And how he liv’d in the green wood,And robb’d there for a space.It seems that tho’ the clergy heHad put to muckle woe,He should not quite forgotten be,Ahho’ he was their foe:This woman tho’ she did him hate,Yet lov’d his memory ;And thought it a wonderous pity thatHis fame with him should die.His epitaph,*as records tell,Within these hundred years,By many was discerned well,But time all thing out-wears. THis followers, when he was dead,Were some received to grace ;The rest to foreign countries fled.And left their native place.And though his funeral was but mean,This woman had in mind,That his fame should be buried clean,From those that came behind :For certainly before, nor since,No man e’er understood.Under the reign of any p' ince,Of one like Robin Hood.Full thirteen years and something more,These out-laws lived thus,Fear’d of the rich, lov’d of the poor,A thing most marvellous:A thing impbssible to us,This story seems to be :None dares be now so venturous,But times are chang’d we see.We that live in those latter daysOf civil government,(If need be) have an hundred waysSuch out-laws to prevent.In those days men more oarbarous wereAnd lived less in awe ;■ Now, God be thanked, people fear,More to offend the law.22No roaring guns were then use,They dreamt of no such thing ;Our Englishmen in fight did chusejThe gallant grey goose wing ;In which activity those men,Through practice were so good,That in those dajs none equaled them,Especially Robin Hood.So that it seems keeping in caves,In woods and forests thick,They'd beat a multitude with staves,Their arrows did so prick ;And none durst near unto them come,Unless in courtesy;All such he bravely would send home ;With mirth and jollity.Which courtesy won him such love,As I before have told ;‘Twas the chief cause that he did proveMore prosperous than he would :Let us be thankful for these timesOf plenty, truth, and peace ;And leave our great and hon id crimes,Lest they, cause this to cease.23I know there's many feigned tales.Of Robin and his crew.But chronicles which seldom fail,Report this to be true ;Let none then think this is a lie.For if‘twere put to the worst,They might the truth descry,In reign of Richard the first.If any reader please to try,As I direction shew,The truth of this brave history.He'll find it true I know :And I shall think my labour wellBestow'd to purpose good,When ‘t shall be said, that I did tell>True tales of Robin Hood.i:24-Mimas try of Kiri" slay in Yorkshire,set over Robin Hood, which (as beforementioned ) was to be read within theseDecembris quarto Die 119S.

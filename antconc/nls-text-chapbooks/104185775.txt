by the the fireside.To hear the wind whistle without.A fine night for the abbey his comrade replied,.Methinks a man’s courage would now be well triedWho would wander the rains about.I’M wager a dinner, the other one cried,That Mary would venture there now,Then wager and lose, with a sneer he replied,I’ll warrant she’d fancy a ghost by her side,And faint if she saw a whita cow.Will Mary this charge on her courage allow ?His companion exclaimed with a smile.I shall win, for I know she will venture there now ;And earn a new bonnet by bringing a boughFrom the aider that grows in the aisle.With fearless good liutuu ui .rviurjiAnd her way to the abbey she bent;The night it was gloomy, the wind it was high,And as hollowly howling it swept through the sky.She shiver’d with cold as she went.O’er the path so well known still proceeded the maid*Where the abbey rose dim on the sight;Through the gateway she entered, she felt not afraid.Yet the ruins were lonely and wild, aul the shadeSeemed to darken the gloom of the night.All around her was silent, save when the rude blastHowl’d dismally round the whole pile ;Over wood-covered fragments still fearless she pass’dAnd arrived at the innermost ruins at last.Where the alder tree grows in the aisle.AYell pleased did she reach it, and quickly drew near,And hastily gathered the bough,When the sound of a voice seemed to rise on her ear, ’She paused and she listened, all eager to hear,And her heart panted fearfully now.UThe wind blew, the hoarse ivy shook over her head ;She listen’d, nought else could she hear :The wihd ceased, her heart sunk inher bosom with dreadFor she heard in the ruin*, distinctly, the treadOf footsteps approaching ker near.Behind a white column half breathless with fear,She crept to conceal herself there ;That instant the moon o’er a dark cloud shone clear.And she saw in the moon-light two ruffians appear,And between, them a corpse did they bear.Then Mary could feel her heart's blood curdle cold :Again the rough wind hurried by ;—It blew off the hat of the one, and, behold;Even close to the feet of poor Mary it roll’dShe fell—and expected to die.Curse the hat, he exclaims, Nay come on, and first hideThe dead body,’ his comrade replies.She beheld them in safety pass on by her side.Then seizes the hat, fear her courage supplied.And away through the abbey she flies.She ran with wild speed, she rush’d in at the door,She cast her eyes horribly round ;Her limbs could support her taint body no more,But exhausted and breathless she sank on the floor,Unable to utter a sound.Ere yet her pale lips could the story impart,For a moment the hat met her view ;Her eyes from the object convulsively start—For, O God, what cold horror thrill'd through her heartWhen the name of her Kichard she knew.Where the old abbey stands, on the common hard by.His gibbet is now to be seen ;Not far from tbe inn it engages the eye,The traveller beholds it, and thinks, With a sigh.Of poor Mary the Maid of the Inn.12THRXJMMY CAP.A 1' A L EIn ancient times, far i- the north,A hundred miles ayont the forth,Upon a stormy winter day,Tvva men forgather’d o’ the way,Ane was a sturdy

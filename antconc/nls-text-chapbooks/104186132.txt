THEHISTORYOFJack and the GiantsPrintedby WILLIAM SCOTT.C V OF SCOTLAND M^ N B u RT H £H I S TO R Y rJACK AND I HE GAINTS.•«>*F A k i I.y&imwL'rrOf his birth and Parent age, and r.vhat vast i.tand the Can nth/ Pic an.IN the reign of King Arthur, near the Lami’ft-cnd o<England namely, in the county of Cornwal, thcrJived a wealthy Farmer, tvho had one only sot; com¬monly known by the name of Jack He was brisk, amiof a lively ready wit: so that whatever he Could apt per-foi rtt by strength, he completed by ingenious wit ancpolicy. Never was any person heard of that couldworst him : nay the very learned, many times he baf¬fled by his cunning, sharp, and ready inventions.For instance, when he was no more than-sevenyears of age, his father, the farmer sent him into theheld to look after his oxen, which were thee feedingin a pleasant pasture : a country Vicar by change outday, coming across the field, called Jack a ink askedhint sevaral questions ; in particular, how many ccm-mandmerits were there? Jack told him, there werenine. The Parson replied, there are ten. Nay quothJack, Master Parson, you are out of that; it js truc||there were ten, but you broke one of them with youiown maid Margery The Parson replied, thou art a«arch wag. Jack. Well Master Parson, quoth Jack.!you have asked me one question, and I have answeredit j I beseech you let me ask you another. Whp madethese oxen ? The Parson replied, God. You are outagain quoth Jack^ for God made them bulls, but my( 3 )father and his man IloU-on made oxen of them.These were the witty exploits of Jack. The Parson,finding himscif fool’d, trudged away, leaving J^ck ina fit of laughter*  T-^<- Hizv a Gai/tf inhabited the Mount of Cdrhwat, andspoiled the country ihereabout.JN those-days the ;nount of Cornwal was kept by ahuge and niounstrous Giant, of twenty-seven feet, height, and about three yards in compass, of j grimcountenance, to tire terror of all the nieghbouringtowns and villages. His habitation was a cave in themidst of the mount neither would he suffer any livin'’-creature to inhabit near him : his feeding was uponother men’s cattle, which often became his preyforwhensoever he had occasion for food, he would wadeover to the main land, where he would furnish him¬self with whatever he could find. For the people athis approach would forsake their habitations : then hewould take their cows and oxen, of which he wouldmake nothing to carry over on his back half a dc«enat a time •, and as for sheep and hogs, he wyuld, tiethem round his wan t like a bunch of bandoliers.. Thishe had for many years practis’d in Cornwal, ejafhichwas very much impoverished by him.But one day Jack coming to the town-hall wherethe Magistrates were siting in consternation about theGaint; he asked what reward they would give to anyperson that would destroy him i They answered, heshall h-ive all the Giant’s treasure in rocom >cnce.Quoth Jack, then I myself will undertake the*work*.( 4 )How ^ach slew this ( iant, and got the name of\yack the Giant Killer' Vw* " * . *'V ' | p -^fj[ ACK, having undevtakeh tliis task, he furnished J;himself with a horn, a shovel and a pick-ax, and 1ever to the mount he goes in the beginning of a darkwinter-evening, where he fell to work and before mor- ■■ning had digged a pit 22 feet d^ep, and almost as sbroad and covered the same all over with long sticks f:and straw $ then strowed a little of the mould upon itso that it appeared like the plain ground.This done, Jack places himself on the contrary side Iof the pit, just about the dawning of the day, when :putting his horn to his mouth, he then blew, Tamtwivik tam twivie. Which unexpected noise rouz’dthe Giant, who came roaring towards Jack, crying outTou incorrigible villian are you come hither to disturbmy rest; you shall dearly pay for it ; satisfication Iwill have, and it shall be this ; I will take you whollyand broil you for my breakfast.—Which words wereno sooner out of his mouth, but he tumbled headlonginto the deep pit, whose heavy‘fall made the veryfoundation ©f the Mount to shake.Oh ! Giant, where are you now ! Faith you are gotinto Lob’s Pond, '‘.here I shall plague you for yourthreatening words. What do you think now of broil¬ing me for your breakfast ? Will no other diet serve▼ou but poor Jack ? Thus having tantalized the Giant^ a while, he gave him a most weighty knock uponthe crown of his head with his pick-ax, so that lie im¬mediately tumbled down gave a most dreadfull groan'and died. This done1,' Jack threw the earth in uponhim, and so buried him } then going and searchingthe ^ave, he found a great quantity of treasdre.( S )Now when the Magistrates, who employed him,”car<| r'ie "'ork was over, they sent for him declaringthat he should be henceforth called Jack-the-Giant-Killer. And in honour thereof, they presented himwith a sword, together with a fine rich embroideredbnt, on which these words were wrought in lettersof gold.Hire's the right valient Cornish manyWho slew the Giant Cormillan.How yack while asleep was taken by aVianf, andhew he got his liberty Again.TiIE news of Jack s victory was soon spread overall the western parts •, when another huge Giantnamed Blunderboar,. hearing of it, vowed to be re¬venged on Jack, if e ver it was his fortune to light up¬on him. This giant kept an enchanted castle, situa¬ted in the midst ol a lonesome wood, on his journeytowards Wales grew very weary, and therefore sathimself down by the side of a pleasant fountain, where,a deep sleep suddenly seized on him a which timethe Giant coming thither for water found’him, andby the lines written on bis bdt knew him to be Jackthat killed his brother Giant, and therefore withoutmaking any words, he ^hrew him upon his shoulder,to carry him to his enchanted castie.Now as they passed thro’ the thicket, the ruffling ofthe boughs awaked poor jacii, who finding himself inthe clutches of the Giant was strangely surprized yetit was but the beginning of his terrors: for, at theentering within the first walls of the castle, he beheldthe ground all covered with bones and sculls of deadmen. 1 he Giant telling Jack that his bones wouldenlarge that he saw. Ibis >aid, he brought him into( '6 ). a large parlour, where he behe!d the bloody quarters©f son e who were lately slain, and in the next roomwere many hearts ahd livers, which the Giant, to ter¬rify Jack, told him, That men’s hearts and liverswere the choicest of his deit. For he commonly as** he said ate them with pepper and vinegar, adding** that he did not question hut his heart'would make• ** hintta dainty bit:” This said lie locks up poor Jackin an upper room, leaving him there, while he wentto fetch another Giant living in the same wood, that‘'lie -might be partaker in the pleasure which theywould have in the destruction of poor Jack.Now, while he was gone, dreadful shrieks andcries affrighted Jack, especially a voice .which con¬tinually cried,■Do what ycu can to get away,i Or you'll become the Giant’s prey :. He’s gone to fetch his brother whoWill kill and lik cwrse torture you.Thisdreadful noise so amaz’d poor Jack/thaf he was• ready to run distracted, then seeing from a window a-far off, the two Giants coming thither, now quoth, Jack to himself, my death or ■deliverance, is at hand.There were strong cords in the room by him, ofwhich he takes two, at the end,of which he makes anoose, and while the Giant was unlocking the irou-tate, he threw the ropes over, each of their heads andthen drawing the other.end across the beam, wherehe pulled with all his mam strength, until he hadthroatlcd them ; and then fastening the rope to thebeam turning towards tire window where he behduthe two Giants to be black in their faces ? then slid¬ing down by the rope, he. came close to their heads■where the helpless Giants could not. defend ihemseL-( T )Tes ”, 3ti4 drawing out his sword, slew them both, anddelivered himself from their intended cruelty ; Thentaking the bunch of heys, he unlocked the room,whe^e upon a strict search, he found three fair la¬dies, tied by the hair of their heads almost starved to•death, who told Jack, that their husbands were slainby the Giant and that they were kept many days with¬out food in order to force them to feed upon the fleshof their husbands ; which they could not, though theyshould be starved to death.Sweet Ladies quoth Jack, I have destroyed thismonster, and his brutish brother, by which I have ob¬tained your liberties. Tins said, he presented then:with the keys of the casile, and so proceeded on hisjourney to Wales.Haw jfack travelled into I'Hfifohire and what hef -JACK, having but very little money, thought itprudent to make the best of his way by travellingas fast as he could, but losing his road was benighted,and could not get a place of entertainment until hecame to a valley, placed between two hills^ wherestood a large house in a lonesome place, and by reasonof his present condition, he took courage to knockat the gate, and to his surprize, there came forth amonstrous Giant, having two heads j yet he did notseem so fiery as the other had been, for he was aWelch Giant, and what he did, was by private and'and seCiCttnaHce, under the false shew of friendshipfor Jack telling his condition, he bid him welcome,shewing him a room with a bed in it, whereupon hemight, take his nights repose : Therefore Jack undres-sed Jiimjclf, and as the Giant was walking to another( 8 )attainment, Jack heard him mutter forth these wordsto hi ms if. * // bo here yon lodge with me this night,7 ou > bait not see the morning tight, CMy dub shall dash your brains outright JSay’st thuu so quoth Jack; this is like of yourWelch tricks, yet 1 hope.to. be cunning enough foryou. Then getting cut of bed he put a billet m hisstead and hid himself in a corner of the room, and inthe <i< d tinie of ihe night, the Welch Giant cameV'- hi great knotty club, and struck several heavyblov a upon the bed where Jack had laid the billetthen re turned to his own chamber, supposing he hadbroke all the bones in his body.In the morning Jack gave him hearty thanks forhis lodging, ihe Giant s.dd to him How have yourested ! Did you not feel something in the night;Nothing, quoth Jack but a rat which gave me threeor four slaps with her tail. Soon after the Giant a -rose and went to breakfast with a bowl of hasty pud¬ding containing near four gallons, giving Jack thelike quantity ; who being loth to let the Giant knowhe could not eat with him, got a large leathern bag,putting it very artfully under his loose coat, intowhich he secretly convey’d his pudding telling theGiant he could shew him a trick ; then taking a largeknife, he ripped open the bag, which the Giant sup¬posing to be his belly, when, out came thchasty pud¬ding ; at whichthe Welch Giant cried out, Cots pinthur can do dat trick huvseif. Then taking his shaifknife, lie ripped up his own belly, Iromthe bottom tothe top and out dropped his tripes and trolly bags sothat hur fell down dead ; thus Jack out vitted" theGiant, and proceeded forward on his journey.( 9 )How lung Arthur’s Son, going to seek his fortune*■ met ’lejih fuck, &c.KING Arthur’s Son only desired of his father tofurnish him with a certain sum of money thathe might go and seek his fortune in the principalityof Wales where a beautiful Lady lived, whom heheard was possessed with seven evil spirits; but theKing his father advised him utterly against it, yet hewould not be pursuaded against it ;■ so that he grant¬ed what he requested which was one horse loadedwith money, and another for himself to rice on, thushe went forth without any attendants.Now after several days travel he came to a maaiettown in Wales, where he beheld a large concourse ofpeople gathered together ; the King’s son demandedthe reason of it, and was told that they arested a corpsefor many large sums of money which the deceased ow¬ed when he died- The King’s son replied, « It is a pi-‘ ty that creditors should he so cruel, go bury the deadand let his creditors come to my lodging, and theirdebt shall be dischargedh Accordingly'they cameand in such numbers that before night he had almostleft himself moneyless.Now Jack-the-Giant-Killer being there, and seeingtne generosity of the King’s son, he was taken withhim, and desired to be his servant, it was agreed up¬on, and the next morning they set forward, when rid¬ing out at the town-end, an old woman called afterhim crying out, ‘ He hath owed ?ne two-pence thesehve years ; pray sir, pay me as well as the rest ?’ heput lus hand into his pocket, and gave it her, it beingthe last he had left, the King's son turning to Jack,said, 1 cannot tell how I will subsist in my intended( 10 )journey. For that quoth Jack, take you no thoughtnor Care, let nVt? alone I u-arrent you we will not want.Now Jack, having a small spell in his pocket, thatserved at noon to give them a refreshment, when donethey Had not Id. left betwixt them ; the afternoonthey spent in travel and familiar discourse, till thesun began to grew low, at which time the King’s sonsaid, jack, since we have tio money, where can wethink to lodge this night ? Jack replied, Master, we’lldo well enough, for I have an uncle that lives about 2little miles pf this ; he’s a huge and monstrous Giantwith three heads: he’ll fight five hundred men in ar.xnour, and make them fly before him. Alas ! quoththr King’s son what shall we do there ? he’ll certain¬ly xhop us both up at one mouthful ! nay, we arescarce enough to fill one of his hollow teeth. It is nomatter for that, quoth Jack, I myselt will go beforeand prepare the way for you ; therefore tarry here &wait my return.He waits, and Jack rides full speed, when comingto the gates of the castle, he knocked with such forcethat he made all the nieghbouring hills to resound.The Giant with a voice like thunder roared out Who’sthere ? He answered, nonebnt your poor cousin JackDear uncle heavy news God wot. Prithee what hea¬vy news com come to me ? I am a Giant with threeheads, and besides thou knowest I can fight 500 menin armour and make them fly like chr.tl before thewind. O ! but, quoth Jack,' here’s the King’s soncoming with 1000 men in armour to kill you, and todestroy all that you have. Gh ! cousin Jack, this isheavy news indeed : I have a large vault under theground, where l will immediately h'de myself, and;hou shall lock bolt and bar me ihj ami tt.cep tiie keyst( 11 )'ji!l the; King’s, son is gone.Now lack having secured the Giant he soon retur¬ned, and Fetched his master, they were both heartilymerry wine, and other dainties which were in thehouse •, so that night they rested in very pleasant lodg*ings, whilst tire poor uncle the Giir.t lay trembling inthe vault under ground.Early in the morning. Jack furnished his masterwith a fresh supply of gold and silver, and then sethim three mi}es forward on his journey, concludinghe was then pretty w’ell out of the smell of the Giantand then returned to let his unc le out of the hole, whoasked Jack wdrat he would give him in reward his cas¬tle was not demolished. Why, quoth Jack, I desirinothing but the old coat and Cap, together with theold rusty sword and slippers which are at your bed¬head ? Quoth the Giant thou fdwlt have them andpray keep them for my sake for they are things of ex-,cellent use. 'The coat wall keep you invisible, thecap will furnish you with knowledge, the sword cutstisundei whatever you strike, and the shoes are of ex¬traordinary vw lit ness; these may be serviceable toyou, and,therefore keep them with all my heart; Jacktakes them, thanking his uncle, and fellows his mas¬ter.Ha iv jfack san-d f>is Master'' s Life, and drove theevil Spirits out of a Lady, &c.I"ACK having overtaken Ids master, they soon af-ter arrived at the Lady s house, who finding theKings son to be a suitor, she prepared a banquet forhim, which being ended, she wiped his mouth withKer handkerchief, saying, A ou must shew me this onenIi>a *f( 12 )to-morrow morning,.or.eke lose your head and withthat she put it into her own bosom.The King’s son went'to bed very sorrowful, butJack’s cap of knowledge instructed him how to ob¬tain it In the middle of the night, she called uponher familiar spirit to carry her to her friend Lucifer.Jack soon put on his coat of darkness with his shoesof swiftness and was there as soon as her, by reasonof his boat they could not see him. When she enter¬ed the place, she gave the handkerchief to old Luci¬fer, who laid it upon a shelf; from-whence Jack tookand brought it to his master, who shewed it to theLady the next day, and sp saved his life.The next night-she saluted the King’s son tellinghim he must shew'her to morrow morning, the lipsthat she-kissed jasf this night or loose his head Ahreplied lie if you "kiss none but mine, 1 w ill ’; ’tis nei¬ther here nor there, said she if you do hot, death’syour portion. At midnight she went as.before, andwas angry with Lucifer lor lettmg the handkerchiefgo, But now, said she, I will be coo hard for theKii >g’s son, for I will kiss thee and he’s to shew thylips'which she did ; Jack standing near hint with hi?sword of sharpness cut off the devil's head & broughtit under his invisible coat to his master, who was inbed, and Lid it at, the end of his bolster. In themorning when the Lady came he pulled it out by thehorns and shewed her the devil’s lips which she kiss¬ed last.Thus having answered, her twice, the enchantmentbroke, and the evil spirits left her ; at which time sheappeared in all her beauty, a beautiful and virtuouscreature. They were married the next morning ingreat pomp and solemnity and soon after they return-( IS)ed with a numerous company fo the court of KingArthur, where they were received with the greatestjpy, and loud acclamations hy ^he wrhole court. Jackfor the many and great exploits lie had done for thegood of his country was made one of the Knights ofRound Table.Thus we have finished the first part of this histo¬ry, which which now leads us to the second, whereinyou have a more full account of the many valiant andwonderful exploits which was. done by the bold ad¬ventures of this great and valiant Hero Jack the-Gian;Killer.■. “ I /• f. 3 ; * ,THE END OF THE FIRST PART.#THE SECOND PART.HnO j a.ck by King Arthur1 s leave, tas/tt in pursuitoj Giants yet alive.JACK having been successful in ail his undertak¬ings resolved not to be idle for the future, but to-perform what service he could for the honour of hisKing and country he humbly requested of the King,2»is Royal Master to fit him with a horse and moneyto travel in search of strange and new adventures:lor said he there are many Giants yet alive in the re¬motest parts of the kingdom and .the dominion ofof Wales, to the unspeakable damage of yaur Majes¬ty s liege sul^ects ; wherefore may it please your Ma¬jesty to give me encouragement and I doubt not butin a short time to cut them off root and branch, andto rid the realm of these cruel Giants and devouringmonsters of nature.Now when the King, had heard these noble propo¬sitions amt had.duly considered the mischievous prac¬tice of those blood thirsty giants. He immediatelygranted what honest Jack requested ; and on the firstclay of March, being thoroughly furnished with allnecessaries for his progress, he took his leave notonly of King Arthur but likewise of all the trusty,ami hardy Knights belonging to the Round Table-when after much salutation and friendly greeting,,they parted the King and his nobles-to their countryplace* ami Jack-the Giant-Killer to the eager pursuitof fortune’s favours, taking with him the cap ofKnowledge, Sword of Sharpness Shoes of Swiftness,and likewise the luyiiuhlc coat, the better to perfect:%( 13 )anti complete the dangerous eutcrprues tlut lay be¬fore him.How Jack sh'u.' a Ginnt, and delivered a KnigfJand his Lady jxom denth.JACK travelled ever vast hills and wonderful moun¬tains) when at the end of three days he came to alarge and spacious wood, thro’ which he must needsto pass, where on a sudden to h’.s great amazement,he heard dreadful shrieks and cries, whereupon, cast¬ing his eye? around to behold what it might be,^ hobeheld with wonder a Giant rushing along with aworthy Knight and his fair Lady, whom he held bythe hair of their heads in his hands, with as muchease as if they had been but a pair ot gloves, the sightof which melted poor Jack into tears of pity and com¬passion : Wherefore he alighten from oft his horse,which he left tied to an oak-tree, and then putting onhis invisible coat, under which he carried his swordof sharpness, he came up to the Giant and though hemade several pistes at him, yet nevertheless, it couldnot reach the trunk of h;s bbdy by reason of his heighttho’ it wounded his thighs in several places, but atlength giving him a swinging stroke, he cut o.this legs just below the knee so that the trunk of hisbody made not oniy the ground to shake, but like¬wise the trees to tremble, with the force of his fallat which bv mere fortune, the Knight and the Ladyescaped his rage then hid Jack time to talk with himand setting his foot upon his neck, said, You savageand barbarous wretc u 1 am come to execute uponyou the just reward of your villauy. And with thatrunning him. through and through, the monster sent[ 16 Jforth a hideous groan, and yielded up his life into thehands of the valiant conqueror, Jack-the-Giant-Killer;whne the noble Knight and virtuous Lady were bothjoyful spectators of his sudden downfal, and theirown deliverance.This being done, the courteous Knight and his fairlady, not only returned him hearty thanks for theirdeliverance, but also invited him home, there to re-fresn himself after the dreadful encounter, as likewiseto receive some ample reward, by way of gratitudefor his good service. No, quoth Jack, I cannot be atease till 1 find oat the den, which was this monster’shabitation, the Knight hearing this waxed right sor¬rowful, and replied, noble stranger, it is too much torun a second risk, for this noted monster lived in aden under yon mountain, with a brother of his, morefierce and fiery than himself, and therefore if youshould go thither and perish in the attempt, it wouldbe the heart-breaking of both me and my lady, let mepersuade you to go with us, aud desist from any fur¬ther pursuit v nay, quoth Jack, if there be another,nay, were there 20, I would shed the fast drop ofblood in my body, before one of them should escapemy fury, and when I have furnished this task I willcome and pay my respects to you. So taking direc¬tions to their habitation, he mounted his horse, leav¬ing them to return nome, while he went in puisuitofthe deceased Giant's brother.Hnv flack slew the ether Giant, and sent boththeir heads to lung Arthur.JACK had not ridden past a mile ami a half before%J he came in sight of the cart's mouth, near to theentrance of which, lie beheld the other Giant sittingupon a huge block of timber, with a knottr iron clublying by Ins side, waiting, as he supposed, for his bro-( 37 >the^s return with his cruel prey, his gople eyes ap¬peared like terrible flames °f hfCj his countenancegrim and ugly and his cheeks appeared like a coupeot iarge fat flitches of bacon, moreover the bristles, ofhis head seemeu to resemble rods of iron-wire ; hi*locks hung down upon his broad shoulders like curled,snakes or hissing adders.Jack alighted from his horse and put him into athicket, then with his coat of darkness became some-wdiat near to behold this figure, and said softly, Oh 3are you there ? it wiil not be long before I take youby the beard. The Giant all this time could not seehim by reason of his invisible coat so coming up closeto him, valaint Jack fetching a blow at his head withIns sword of sharpness, and missing somewhat of hisaim cut of the Giant’s nose, these nostrils were widerthan a p,.h of jack-boots ; die pain was terrible, andso lie put his hand to feet for his nose, and when hecould not find it, hc-rav’dand roared louder than clapsof thunder, and tho’ he turned up his large eyes hecould not see from whence the blew came which haddone him that great disaster nevertheless he took uphis iron headed club and began to lay about him like•one stark mad. Nay, quoth jack, If you be for thatsport, then 1 will dispatch you-quickly, for fear of anaccidental blow falling out. Then as the Giant rosefrom his block, Jack makes no more to do but runshis sword up to the hilts in tire Giant’s “fundament,where he left it sticking for a while, and stood himselflaughing with his hands a-kimbo to sec the Giant ca¬per and dance the canaries with 'he sv.ord in his arsecrying out he should die, lie should die with the grip¬ping of his guts. Thus did the Giant continue ravingtor an hour or mere ; and at length fell down deadwhose dreadful fall had like to have crushed poorJack had he not been nimble enough to avoid it.( 13 )This being done Jack cut offboth the Giants5 head*and sent them both to King Arthur by a waggoner,whom he hired for the purpose, together with anaccount of his prosperous success in ail his undertak-ings.Hcnv ^ack searched their Cave, and delivered manycut of Captivity.JACK having thus dispatch’d these two^monsters,resolved with himself to enter the cave in searchof these Giants’ treasure : he passed along thro’ manyturnings and windings, which led him at length to aroom, paved with free stone, at the upper end ofwhich was a boiling caldron, then on the right handstood a large tabl/ > whtttai he supposed the'Giantsused to dine, then he came to the iron gate where was•a window secured with bars of iron, through whichhe looked and there behdd a vast many miserablecaptives, who seeing Jack at a distance, cried out witha loud voice, Alas i young man, art thou come herei to be one among us in this misserable den ? Ay quothJack, I hope I shall rot be long here : but pray tellme what is the meaning of your captivity ? Why Said• one of them, H! tell you we are persons that havebeen taken by the Giants who keep this cave, andhere we are kept till such time as they’ve occasion fora good feast, and then the fatest among us is slaugh¬tered and prepared for their devouring jaws ; dris;■ not long since they took three of us for the same-pur¬pose ; nay many are the times they’ve dined on mur¬dered men. Kay you so, quoth Jack, well 1 Have giventhem both such a dinner, that it will be long enoughere they'll have occasion for any more. The misera¬ble captives were amazed at these wards \ you maybelieve me quoth Jack, for I have slain them betawith the.point pf my sword, and as for their mon-( IS >strous Keiuls, I sent them in a waggon to the court otKing Arthur, as trophies of my unparalleled victory.And in testimony of the truth of what he had said heunlocked the iron-gate, setting the miserable captives.•at liberty who all rejoiced like condemned malefactorsat the sight of a reprive : then leading them togeth¬er to the aforesaid room, he placed them round thetable and set before them two quarters of beef, as al¬so bread and wine and so he feasted them plentifully»supper being ended, they searched the Giants’ coderswhere finding a vast store of.gold and silver, Jack e-qually divided it amongst them; they all returnedhim hearty thanks for their treasure and miraculousdeliverence. That night they went to their rest and*'in the morning they arose and departed, the captivesto their respective towns and places of abode, and Jack• to the Knight’s house, whom he had formerly deliver¬ed from the hand of die Giant.How “flack came to the Knight's house^ and his no¬ble entertainment there. &c.(1T was about sun rising when Jack mounted hishorse to proceed on his journey, and by the helpof his directions he came to the'Knight’s house sometime before noon, where lie was received with all de¬monstrations of joy imaginable, by the Knight and hisXady, who in an honourable respect to Jack prepareda feast, which lasted .for many days, inviting all tnegentry in the adjacent parts to whom the worthy'•Knight was pleased to r, late the mannerof his former: danger, and the happy deliverance, by tire undaunted-courage of Jack-the-Giant Killer and by way of gra¬titude, he presented him with a ring of gold, oa-which wa-sc\)graven by curious art, the picture of theGiant dragging a distressed Knight and his fair Ladyby the hair of the head, with tliis/mottb,11. ( 20 )IVe were in sad distress you see.Under a Giant's jierce command,Buf traiifd our lives ana libertv.By valient yfacbs victorious hand.Now amongst the vast assembly there present were- igec gcnlemen who were fathers to some of!miserable captive , whom Jack had lately set at liber¬ty who understanding that he was the person thatperformed these great wonders, immediately paid himleir venerable respec's.; after which their mirth in¬creased and the smiling bow-1 went freely round to theprosperous succes, of the victorious conquerer. Butin the midst of all their mirth, a dark cloud appearedwhicn daunted every heart in this assembly,t hus it was a meseenger brought th edismal tidingsot the approach of one Thunderful, a huge Giant,with two heads : who having heard of the death of hiskinsmen, the above named Giants, was come fromtne northern pole in search of Jack, to be revenged onhim for their most terrible downfall and was withina mile of the Knight’s seat, the country people flyingetorc him, from their houses and habitations likec...: lie fore the wind. When they had related this,■ic not a whit daunted, said, let him come, I am pre-p imd w ith a tool to pick his teeth, and you gentlemenand ladies -walk hut forth into die garden, and yon,s all hr the joyful spectators of'his monstrous Giant’s<t'.tn and destruction. i o v mcli tlu-y all consented•every one wishing him good fortune in that great anddangerous enterprise.Il'jw jUick &vei tureia the Giant in the Meat, and. cut off both, his heads, &c^i} ‘Hh situation or the Knight’s house,take as follows;It was,placed in the midst of a small island en¬compassed round .with a vast Moat thirty feet deep. ( 21 )and twenty feet wide, over which Jack employed twomen to cut it on both sides, almost ro the middle, andthen dressing himself in his Coat of Darkness, like¬wise putting on his Shoes of Swiftness, he marchedforth against the Giant with his Sword of Sharpnessready drawn, yet when he came cloSs up to him theGiant could not see Jack, by reason of the invisiblecoat which he had on, nevertheless he was sensible ofsome approaching danger, which made him cry out,Fe Ft F& Fum/ smell the bhod of an Englishman,lie he living or be he dead.I'll grind his bones to mix my bread.Sayst thou so quoth Jack, then thou art a monstrousmiller indeed : f$ut how if I should serve thee as. Idid the two Giants of late, in my conscience 1 wouldspoil your practice foj the future. At which time theGiant spoke with a voice as loud as thunder : art thouthat vallain which destroyed my two kinsmen ; thenI will tear thee with my teeth, suck thy blood ; andwhat is more, I will grind thy bones to powder. Youmust catch me first, quoth Jack, and wdth that hethrew off his coat of darkness that the Giant mightsee him clearly and then ran freni him a thro’ fear.- The Giant with foaming mouth and glaring eyes,following after like a wading castle, making the foun¬dation of the earth as it were to shak*^ at every step.Jack led him a dance three or four times round theMoat that belonged to the Knight’s house, that theLadies and Gentlemen might take' a full view' of thishuge monster of nature, who followed Jack with allhis'might, but could not overtake him by reason of HisShoes of Swiftness, which carried him faster than theGiant could follow.

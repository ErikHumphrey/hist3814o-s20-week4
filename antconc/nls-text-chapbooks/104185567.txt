r THE HISTOKY OFThe kicked Life and horrid Deafh ofDr. John Faustus,SMEWINOHon he sold himself to (he Devil to have Potverjof24 years to do what lie pleased,Also‘the strange things done by him andMEPHOSTOPHILES.With an account how the Devil came for| him at the end of 24 years, andtore him in pieces*THEHISTORYOFDr, JOHN FAUSTUSCHAP L,,Dr. Faustus’s birth and education ,*with an account of his falling fromthe Scriptures.BOCTOR JOHN FAUSTUS Wasborn in Germany ; his father was apoor labouring man not able to bringup his son ; but he had a brother in thesame country, who was a very rich manbut had never a child, and took a greatfancy to his cousin, and he resolved tomake a scholar of him ; and in orderthereuntq, put him to the latin school,where he took his leyning extraordinarywell ; afterwards he put him to the uni¬versity to study divinity ; but' Faustuscould in no wise fancy that employ¬ment ; wherefore he betook himself to‘he studying cf that which his inclina-tion was most for, viz. necromancy andconjuration, and in a little time few ornone conld out-strip him in the art : healso studied divinity ; of which he wasmade doctor ; but within a short timefell into such deep fancies and cogitationsthat he resolved to throw the scripturesfrom him, and betake himself wholly tothe studying of necromancy and conju¬ration, charms and soothsaying, witch¬craft and tho like.chap; ii.How Dr. Fanslus conjur'd up the De¬vil, making him appear at his house.FAUSTUS, whose mind was to stu¬dy conjuration, which he jfollowednight and day ; he took the wing ofan eagle and^endeavoured to fly over theworld to see and know all the secrets ofheaven and earth : in a short time he at¬tained power to command the devil toappear before him , when he pleased.One day as Dr. Faustus was walking ina wood, near to Wiitemberg, in Germa¬ny, he having a ftiend with him ^thatwas desirous to know the doctor's art,,he desired him to let him see if he couldthen and there bring Mephostophiies be¬fore him ; all which the doctor immedi-4ately did, and the devil upon the firstcall made such a noise in the wood as ifheaven and earth would have come to¬gether $ then the devil made such aroaring, as if the wood had been full ofwild beasts. The doctor made a qrelefor the devil, the which circle the de¬vil ran round, making a noise as if tenthousand waggons had been running uponpaved stones. After this it thunderedand lightned as if the whole world hadbeen on fire. Faustus and his friend, a-mazed at this noise, and the devil's longtarrying thought to leave the circle ;whereupon the devil made him suchmusic, the like was never heard in theworld; this so ravished Faustus that hebegan again to conjure Mephostophilesin the name of the prince of the devils,to appear in his own likeness; whereupon,in an instant, hung over his head a migh¬ty dragon. Faustus calls again after hisformer manner, after which there was acry in the wood as if hell hid been opened,and all the tormented souls had beenthere ; Faustus, in the mean while askingthe devil many questions, and command¬ing him to shew many tricks.CHAP. IllJ¥ow Mephoslophiles came (o Dr>Fauslus^s house, and what hap¬pened between thefn.| II AUSTU5 commanded the spiritto meet him at his house by ten o£M the clock the next day. At thehour appointed he came into his; chamber, asking Faustus £vvhat he wouldhave j Faustus told him, it was his will; and pleasure to conjure him to be obedientto him in all points of those articles, viz.First, That the spirit shall serve him inall things he asked, from that time till: his death.■ Secondly, Whatsoever he would have,he should bring him.Thirdly, Whatsoever he desired to knowhe shsould tell him.The spirit answered him and said, het had no such power of himself, untill he| had acquainted his prince that ruled overtl him : for said he, we have rulers over us,1 that send us out,.and command us home,| when they please ; and we can act no far-| ther than our power is, which we receive^ from lucifer, who you know for his pride] was thrust out of heaven. But, saith the1 spirit, I am not to tell you any more ex-» cept you make yourself over to us.6*Whereupen. Faustus said, I will havemy request; but yet I will not be damnedwith you. Then said th% spirit, youmust not, nor shall not have your desire,and yet thou art mine, and all the worldcannot save thee out of my hands. Thensaid Faustus, get thee hence, and I conjurethee, that thou come to me at night. Thespirit then vanished, Faustus then began toconsider how he might obtain his desire,and not to give his soul to the devil.And while Faustus was in these devilishcogitations, night drew on, and this hellishspirit' appeared to Faustus, acquaintinghim that now he ' had orders from hisprince to be obedient to him, and to dofor him whatsoever he desired provided hewould promise to be his, and withall toacquaint him first, what he w'ould have ofhim ? Faustms replied that his desire was, to become a spirit,, and that Mephostophil-es should be always at his command ;that whensoever he called for him, heshall appear invisible to all men, and thathe should appear in what shape he pleased.To which the spirit answered, that allhis desires should be granted if he wouldsign those articles, he should have whate¬ver, he would tVish or ask for ; whereuponDr Faustus withdrew and pricked his7rwrist, receivi^ the blood ina small saucerwhich cooled so fast, as if it forewarnedhim of the hellish act he was going to com¬mit ;. nevertheless he put it over. embers; to warm it, and writ as follow'eth :I, John Faustus, approved doctor ofdivinity, with my own hand do acknow¬ledge and testify myself to become a ser¬vant to lucifer, prince of Septentrional and‘ Orient, and to him I freely and voluntary]5 give both body and soul j in consideration| • for the space of twenty four yearc, if I be' served in all things I shall require, or| which is reasonable "by him to be allowed:at the expiration of which from the dateI ensuing, I give to him all power to do with| rne at his pleasure ; to rule to fetch andcarry me where he pleases body and soul:hereupon I defy God and Christ, and allthe host of angels and good spirits j all li¬ving creatures that hear his shape, or onj whom his image is imprinted ; and to thebetter strengthening the validity of thiscovenant and firm agreement between us,| I have writ it with my own blood, and sub¬scribed my name to it, calling all the pow-I ers and infernal potentates to witness it ismy true intent and meaning.JOHN FAUSTUS.<sWhai happened to Dr Faustus afterthe signing of the articles.HT/ITHEN Faustus had made an%/lL/ end of his writing, he called/ v Mephostophiles to him, and de* 1livered him the bond ; where¬upon the spirit told him, that if he did not•repent of what he had done, he should en¬joy all the pleasure his thoughts couldform, aitd that he would immediately di¬vert him. lie caused a kennel of houndsto run down a hart in the hall, and vanish¬ed: then a bull danced before Faustus; alsothere was a lion r.nd a bear which fell tolightning before Faustus, and the lion des-trbyed the bear ; alter that came a dragonand destroyed the lion : and this, with a-fcundance of more pastime dfd the spiritpresent to the doctor’s view concludingwith all manner of music, with some hun¬dreds of spirits which came and dancedbefore Faustus. After the music was o->er, and Faustus began to look about him,he saw ten sacks full of silver, which hewent to dispose of but could not, for none,could handle it hut himself, it was so hot.This pastime did so please Faustus, thathe gave Mephostophiles the will that hemade, and kept a copy of it in his ownhands. The spirit and Faustus being agreedthey dwelt together, and the devil was intheir house-keeping ; for their was neverany thing given aw^y to the poor, whichbefore Faustus made this contract was fre¬quently done, but the case is now altered.CHAP. V.iHow Faustus served the Duke ofBavaria,FAUSTUS having sold h!s soul tothe devil it was reported among hisneighbours, so that none wouldkeep his company, but his spiritwhich was very frequent with him anddid whatsoever he commanded him, play¬ing merry tricks for to please Faustus,Not far from Faustus’s house lived theDuke of Bavaria, the Duke of Saxony,and the Bishop ot Salisbury, whose hou¬ses and cellars Mephostophiles^used, and tobring the best of every thing they had :.one day the~ Duke of Bavaria had invitedmost of tire gentry of the country to din¬ner, for whose entertainment there was a-bundance of provisions made ready : themgentry being come, and ready to sit downto dinner, in an instant Mephostophilescame and took away all with him, leavingthem full of admiration. If aify time^austus had a mind for a wild fowl, the' spirit wquld call whole flocks in at a win¬dow ; also the spirit did teach Faustus todo the like, so that now no lock nor keycould keep them out. The devil also 1taught Faustus to fly into the air, and toact many things which are incredible, andtoo large for this small book to contain.CHAP VI.How Dr Faustus dreamed of hell inhis sleep and what he saw there,AFTER Faustus had a long confer¬ence with his spirit concerning thefall of lucifer, and the state andcondition of all the fallen angels*he, in a vision or dream, saw hell and ^11the devils and souls that were tormentedthere : he also saw hell divided into seve- 1ral cells, or deep holes ; and for every cell, ;or deep ward, there was a devil appointedto punish those that were under his custo¬dy. Having seen this sight he much mar¬velled at it; and having Mephostophileswith him, he asked him what sort of peoplethey vtre t^iat % hi the first dark pit ?• '* ■**■ . v • >-411Mephbstophiles told him they were thosewho pretended themselves to be physiciansand had poisoned many thousands to trypractice ; and now saith the spirit they havethe same administered to them as they didto other*, though not with the same effect,for they will never die here saith he. Overtheir heads was a shelf laden with gallipotsfull of poison. Haying past them, he cameto a long entry exceeding dark, where therewas a hrighty crowd, he asked them whatthose were ? the spirit told him'they werepick-pockets j who loved to be in a crowdwhen they were in the other world, and tocontent them, they put them in a crowdthere-, amongst them were some padders onthe highway, and those of that function.Walking further he saw many thousandsof vintners, and some millions of taylors,insomuch that they cculd not tell whenceto get stowage for them ; a great numberof pastry-cooks with peels on their- heads.Walking further, the spirit opening a greatcellar door,, from which arose a terrible<noise,he asked what they were? the spirittold him they were witches, aad those thathad been pretended saints in the otherworld; but how they did squ’able,. fight*-and tear one another ! not,far from • themby the whoremongers and. adulterers who'made such a hideous noise that he wasvery much startled. Walking down afew steps, he espied an incredible number,alrrost hid with smoke ; he asked what' ty were ? the spirit told him they weremil’ers and bakers ; but, good lack, what jfa noise was there among them, the millerscrying to the bakers and the bakers to themillers for help, but all was in vain, forthere was none to help them. Passing onfurther he saw thousands of shopkeepers,some of whom he knew, who were tor¬mented for defrauding and cheating theircustomers. Having taking this prospectaf hell, the spirit Mephostophiles tookhim in his arms and carried him home tohis own house, where he awaking, was a-mazed at what he had seen in his dream.Being come to himself, he asked the spi¬rit in what place hell was, and who madeit ; Mephostophiles answered, knowestthou, that before the fall of Luciler, therewas no hell, but upon his fall, was ordain¬ed. As for the substance of hell wc de¬vils do not know ; it is the wrath of <Jod'hat makes hell so furious, and what weprocured by our fail : but where hell is,how it is governed, and whatesoeverthou desirest to know v-hen thou comest-there thou shak t'e -satisfied. as far r.$ weinew ourselves. ’ »isCHAP VII.Containing some Tricks of DrFaustus. '' ■ R Faustus having attained his de-■sire of his spirit, had now fullJL^ power to act or do any thingwhatever he pleased ; upon atime the Emperor had a desire to see him,and likewise some of the doctor's tricks;whereupon he tWis requested by the em-j - peror to do somewhat to make him merry,| but the doctor in the mean while lookinground about him, at last espied a lordlooking out at the window, and the doctorcalling his spirit to help him, he in an in¬stant fastened a large pair of horns upon|j the lord’s head, that he could not get his(head in till Faustus took the horns offagain, which were soon taken off invisibly:the lord whom Faustus had served so’ wasextremely vexed, and resolved to be reven¬ged on the doctor, and to that end, lay amile out of town fpr Faustus’s passing by,he being that day to depart from the coun¬try ; Faustus coming by the wood side, be¬held the lord mounted upon a mighty war-likehorse* who ran full drift against Faus¬tus, who by the help of his spirit, tookhim and all, and carried him before the-14emperor’s palace, and grafted a pair ofhorns on his head as big as an ox’s :which he could never be rid of, but worethem to his dying day.CHAP. VIII.Hot® Dr. Faustus eat a loadof hay.’FAUSTUS, upon a time, havingutany docfors and masters of arts,with him, went to walk in the field,where they met with a load of hay:how now, good fellow, saith Faustrus,what shall 1 give thee to fill my belly withhay ? the clown thought he had been amad-man to talk of eating hay, told himhe should fill his belly for a penny ; towhich the doctor agreed, and fell to eat-ing, and quickly devouring half the load :at which the doctor’s companions laughed,to see how simply the poor country fellow 'looked, and to hear how heartily he pray-ed the doctor to forbear : Faustus pityingthe poor man went away, and before theman got near home, all the hay.was in thecart that the doctor had eaten, which madethe country fellow admire.'15CHAP. IX.How he struck a parcel of studentsthat were fighting together blind;and how he served a parcel ofclownswho were singing and ranting in aninn.THIRTEEN students meeting withseven more near Dr. Faustus’shouse, fell out extremely, first inwords, and at last to blows •, thethirteen being too hard for the seven,and Dr. Faustus looking out of his windowand seeing the fray and how much theywere over matched, conjured fhemaltblind,so that, one could not see the other; andin this manner they fought and smote oneanother, which made all that saw themlaugh ; at length the people parted themand led them to their chambers, and theyinstantly received sight. The doctor com-ming into an inn with some friends wasdisturbed by the hallowing and bawling ofa parcel of drunken clowns, whereuponwhen their mouths were wide open he soconjured them, that by no means theycould shut them again ; and so all on asudden there was a deep silence ; and afn,ter they had stared one upon another, with¬out being able to speak, thinking they we re16bewitched they dropped one by one awayin a stinking fear, and never could be gotto the house afterwards.CHAP X.How Dr Faitstvs keiped a youngman to a lady,There was a gallant young gentlemanthat was in love with a fair ladywho was of proper personage, nearWirtemberg, near the doctor’shouse : this gentleman had long soughtthis lady in marriage, but could not attainhis desire ; and having placed his affectionsso much upon her, he was ready to pineaway, and had certainly died with griefhad he not made his address to the doctor,to whom he opened the whole matter.No sooner had the gentleman told his caseto the doctor, but he told him he need notfear, for his desire should be fulfilled,and that this gentlewoman should havenone but him, which was accordinglydone; for Faustus so changed the mindof the damsel by his damnable practice,that she could think of'nothing else buthim she before hated; and Fausfus’s de¬sire was thus; he gave him an enchantedring, which he ordered him to put intothe lady’s hand, or to slip it on her finger.nwhich he did ; and no sooner had she thering but her heart burnt with love to him;she instead of frowns, could do nothing butsmile upon him, and not be at rest till sheasked him if he thought he could love her,aud make her his wife ?,he gladly answer¬ed, with all his heart. So they were mar¬ried the next day, and all by the help ofDr Faustus.CHAP XI.How Dr Faustus made seven womendance naked in the market place.f^AUSTUS walking in the marketsaw seven women sitting all in arow selling eggs, butter, &c. Ofevery one he bought somethingand departed. No sooner was he gone,but all the eggs and butter were gone outof their baskets, and they knew not how :at last they were told, that Dr Faustus hadconjured their goods away ; they thereu¬pon ran speedily to the doctor’s, and de¬manded satisfaction for their ware ; he re¬solving to make himself and the town’speople merry by his conjuring art, madethem return to their baskets naked as everever they were born ; and having dancedawhile in the market place, every one’sgoods were conjured into their baskets a-gain, and be set them at their liberty .*7..ifJ8CHAP. XII.//ow Fauslus served a coutry fellowthat was driving of swine.DR Faustus, as he was going toWirtemberg overtook a countryfellow driving an hundred swine,which was very headstrong, somerunning one way and some another ; sothat the driver could not tell how to getthem along : the doctor taking noticeof it, by his conjuring art, made eve¬ry one of them dance upon their twohind legs, with a fiddle in, one of theirfore feet, and with the other fore foot theyplay’d upon the fiddle, and so they dancedand fiddled all the way till they came intoTV irtemberg market. The driver of themall the rvay dancing before them, whichmade the people wonder : after the doctorhad satisfied himself with the sport he con¬jured the fiddles away, and the driverthen offered to sale, and quickly soldtheiy all, and took the money ; butbefore he was gone out of the house,* Faustus had conjured the hogs out ofthe market place, and sent them all,home to the aforesaid driver’s house.The man that bought them seeing allI'Ifthe swine gone, stop’d the man thatsold them, and would have his moneywhich he was forced to pay, and so re¬turned home sorrowfull, and not knowing what to do ; but, to his great a-mazement, found all his swine in theirstyes.CHAP xm.Ho\n Dr Faustus began to bethinkhimselj ofthe near approach of his end*FAUSTUS having spun put histwenty four years, within amonth or two, began to consi¬der what he should do to cheatthe devil, but could not find any wayto prevent his miserable end, whichwas now near; whereupon he thuscries out to himself, O miserable wretchthat I am, I have given myself to thedevil lor a few years pleasure, to satis¬fy my carnal and devilish desires, andnow I must pay full dear ; now mustI pdy full dear; now must I have tor¬ment without any ease; woe is me,for there is no help for me: I darenot, I cannot look for mercy from God,sofor I haye abandoned him, and havegiven myself to the devil* to be his forever: and now my time is almost ex¬pired ; I have had my desires; my |jfilthy lusts I have satisfied; and I mustbe tormented for ever and ever.A neighbour of his, a godly old manrhearing of his way of living, in com- Ipassion to his soul came to him, andwith tears besought him to have moreregard to his precious soul, laying be¬fore him the promise of God’s graceand mere}7, freely offered to repentingsinners, and spoke so feelingly, that iFaustus shed tears, and promised totry to repent. This good man was nosooner gone but Mephostophiles foundhim pensive on his bed, and suspect¬ing what had happened, began to re¬proach him with breach of covenantto his lord lucifer, and thereupon al¬most twisted his neck behind him,which made him cry out most lament¬ably, threatening to tear him in pieces,unless he renewed his obligation, whichfor fear, with much sorrow he did, in& manner the same as tfie former,which he confirmed by the letter#Homs Dr, Faustus was warned of thespirit to prepare for his end.B i^ AUSTUS’s foil time being comeIM the spirit appeared to him, andshewed him his writing, and toldhim that the next night the de*vil would fetch him away, which madethe doctor’s heart ake; but to diverthimself, he sent for some doctors andmaster batchelors of arts, and otheris students to dine with him, for whomI he provided great store of varieties,1 with music and the like; but all wouldI not keep up his spirits, for the hour;i drew near : whereupon his counte-I nance changing, the doctors and mas-:i ters of art enquired of him the reasonsji of his melancholiness; to which Faus-I tus answered, my friends, you haveI known me these'many tears, and howII have practised ail manner of wicked-[ ness, 1 have been a great conjuror,* which devilish art 1, obtaiued of the32devil; and also to obtain power to dowhatever I pleased, I sold myself to jthe devil for twenty four years time;which full time being out this night,makes me full of horror, I have calledyou my friends to see this my dread¬ful end ; and I pray let my miserabledeath be a warning to you all, howyou study that devilfch art of conjur-r ing; for if you once begin it, a thou¬sand to one but it w ill lead you to thedevil, whither I am this night to gowhether I will or no. They hearingof this sad story, blamed him for con¬cealing it so long, telling him if he hadmade them acquainted before, they, thought it might have been prevented.He told them, he had a desire severaltimes to have disclosed this intrigue,but the devil told him if he did, hewould presently fetch him away; healso told them, he had a desire to joinwith the godly, and leave ojT thatwicked course, but immediately thedevil used to come and torment him,&c, But now, saith Faustus, it is but23 .in vain for me to talk of what I didintend, for I have sold myself to thedevil, body and soul is his. No soon¬er had he spoke these words, but sud¬denly it fell a thundering and1 light¬ning, the like was never heard; where¬upon Faustus wentinto the great hall,the doctors and masters staying in thenext room, intending to hear his end.About twelve o’clock the house shookso terribly, that they thought it wouldhave tumbled down upon their heads;and suddenly all the windows of the1, house were broke to pieces, as if allj nature had been changed; so that! they trembled and wished themselvesi elsewhere; when upon a great clapof thunder, with a whirlwind the doorsflew open, and a mighty rushing ofj'wind entered, with the hissing of ser-pents, shrieks and cries, Upon whichI he lamentably cried out murder, and «there was such roaring in the hall, asif all the devils in hell had been there,j "When day-light appeared, they tookXhe boldness to enter the room, andV*24founfi his brains beaten out againstthe wall, and the floor sprinkled withblood ; and his eyes tom out, veryterrible to behold; but missing thebody, they went in search of it, andfound it on the dung*hill, mangledand mashed to pieces, so ended thismiserable wretch’s life, forsaking Godand all goodness, and given up to hisimplacable enemy, which we hopemay stand, not only as a fearful, butlasting monument and warning toothers. His mangled body in respectto his function, learning, and otherqualifications, was decently buried.FINIS,/

His very belly was a’1.sunburnt like a piper’s bag, or the head of a*|auld drum, and yet his beard began to sprout oi tllike herring banes. He took thick brose to h:breakfast, and baps and ale through the day, anwhen the coals selled dear, and the win’ was cauk:bought an oven-farl, and twa Dunbar Waddersor a Glasgow Magistrate, which fish-wifes ca’swastlin herrin’.His mither, auld Mary, plagued him ay in -tinmorning; she got up when the hens keckled, riping the ribs, blew her snotterbox, primed her nosekindled her tobacco-pipe, and at every pufbreathed out frettingrs agfainst her hard fortune anclanely single life. O but a widow be a poolname; but I live in a wilderness in this lang-lonen, mony a man gaes by my door, but fewfolks looks in to poor Mary. Hoch hey, will 11never win out of this wearied life. Wa Sawny,man, wilt thou not rise the day ; the sun’s up,and-a’ the nibours round about; Willie and Char¬lie is on the hill an hour syne, and half gate hameagain. Wilt thou rise' an gie the beasts a bite,thou minds na them, I watman. Grump grump,,quo Sawny, they got their supper an hour afterI got mine. Shut to dead come on them everyane an they get a bit frae me till they work for’t-Sawny. But mither I’ve been dreaming thatI was married, an’ in the bed aboon the bride;5J I wonder gin it be true ? Od, I ne’er got sic fun:what will’t be, think ye ? how auld am I mither ?do you think I could man a hissy yet? fegs Ihave a mind to try ; but the saucy hissies will nahae me, I ken weel enough,i Mither. Say you lad, ay mony a hungry heartwrad be blythe o’ you, but there was never a sca’dJockey but there was a scabbed Jenny till himyet: dinna be scar’d lad.Sawny. A hech, mither, I’se no be lordly an’I sud tak a beggar wife aft’ the hi’ gate; but I’lltell ye something that I’m ay thinking on, butye maun na tell the neihbours, for the chiels|wad aye jaw me wi’t.Mither. Wad I tell o’ thee lad ? I wad tell o’amysel as soon.Sawny. Do ye mind mither, that day I gade0 the Pans I came in by auld Mattie’s yourountrywoman, the Fife wife, it cam’ out o’ theown ye cam frae, the wife that says Be-go lad¬ies, I gade there, an she was unco kind, andade me fat brose out of the lee side o’ her kail-ot: there was baith beef and paunches in’t; odithey smell’d like ony haggis, and shined a’ likea gould fac’d waiscoat: fegs I suppit till I wasike to rive o’ them and had a rift o’ them thejmorn a’ day; when I came out I had a kite like1 cow wi’ calf; she spiered for you, mither, and6J said ye was gaily; and she looked to me, and |ileuch, and gripped my shakle-bane, and said I I.would be a sturdy fallow yet—I looked to her,and thought I liked her, and thinks on*t aye sincesyne: she leugh, and bade me seek out a coaldriver for her, for she didna like to carry a fish .creel.Mither, Forsooth, Sawny, I’ll gie my twalugs for a lav’rock’s egg if she binna in love wi’thee, and that will be a bargain.Sawny. An upon my word mither, she’s asturdy gimmer, well worth the smoaking after;she has a dimple on every cheek, an hauncheslike a sodjer’s lady’s hoop, they hobble when sheshakes, and her paps play nidlety nod when shegangs; I ken by her heckling she has a conceitof me.Mither. But Sawney man, an thou see hermither Matty in the town, auld be-go laddie asyou ca’ her, gie her a dram, she likes it weel;spout ye a mutchkin of molash in her cheek,ye’ll get her mind, and speed the better.Sawny, But mither, how sud I do when Igang to court her? will I kiss her, an kittle herand fling her o*er as the chiels do the hissesamang the hay. I‘ve seen them gang owre ither,and owre ither, and when they grip them by thewame, they‘d cry like a maukin.1,iil*lid),Iff,!tilMither. Hout awa, daft doug it thou is, that’sno the gate; thou maun gang in wi’ braw goodmanners, and something manfu’, put on a Sun¬day’s face, and sigh as ye were a saint, sit downbeside her, as ye were a Mess John, keek ayetill her now and then wi’ a stowen look, and haudyour mouth as mim and grave as a May-puddock,or a whore at a christening; crack well o’ ourwealth, and hide our poverty.Sawny. Ay, but mither there is some itherway in courting nor that, or the lassies would nacouple so close to them,Mither. Ay, but Sawny man there’s a timefor every thing, and that too ; when ye sit wherenaebody sees you, you may tak her head in youroxter like a creesh pig; dab nebs wi’ her nowand then ; but be sure you keep a close mouthwhen you kiss her, clap her cheeks and straikher paps, but for your drowning gang na fartherdown ; but fouks that’s married can put their handto ony part they like.Sawny. Aha but mither I didna ken the firstword o’ courting, the lassie I’ll no ken what I’mcorn’d about.Mither. Ay will she lad, wink and keek wellto her, she’ll hae a guess, seek a quiet word ofher at the door, and gin it be d^rk, gie her a bitwee kiss when ye hae tell£d her your errand, and8ygin they gie you cheese and bread, or ony meai.be sure you ca‘t guid, whether it be sae or no:and for my blessing, be mensfu wi your mouth,and dinna eat unca muckle, for I£ve seen you supas mony milk brose-as would have saired twa mento carry on a barrow.Sawney. Aha, but mither yource lying now,for I never did it but ance, but an they set meatafore me an I be hungry, deil claw the clungestan I binna upsides with it for the same. Adeedmither, fouk maun hae meat an they should neerget wives, and there some of them no worth curs¬ing, an a body werna setting an oath whether orno; a hear ye that now, when ye put me till‘t,and gar me speak, ay by my sooth, I would ratherhae a bit good poney and a pund of cheese,' or J•were bound to bab after ony hizzies buttocks 1see yet. *Mither. Wa Sawny man, thoucs a fool, anthat‘s a fault; gin every ane were as easy aboutwomen as thou is, the warld wad be a wildernessin a wee time, there wad be nae body to inhabitthe earth but brute beasts ; cats and dogs wad beworrying ither, and every thing wad gae to con¬fusion. Gae to the courting, ye dog that yeare, and either do something or naething at a‘.END OF FART I.Up got Sawney in the morning, and swallowedowre sodded meat flag by flag ; and aff he goesto the coals and the courting, lilting and singinglike a laverock in a May morning—U to be mar¬ried if this be the way*The colliers wondered a’ to see him sae wellAbuskit wi a pair of wally side auld-fashionedleather breeks of his father’s, and an auld creeshyhat, mair like a fryingpan than ony thing else ;a lang cravat like a minister or Baillie Duff at aburial, a clean face and hands, and nae less thana gun-sleeved linen sark on him, which made hischeeks to shine like a sherney weight, and thecolliers swore he was as braw as a horse gaun toa cow{s dredgy.But Sawny came off wi his coals, whistlingand whipping up the poor beasts, even as outrage¬ous as ony ram at riding time; well might onybody see there was a storm in Sawny’s nose, lightwhere it like ; for no sooner had he selled hiscoals, than he left his horse to come hame wi anibour callan, and gad keekin up the Cowgate,and through the closses, seeking auld Be-go, hisguid-mither to be ; then in through the fish-mar¬ket, where he bought twa lang herrin, and twabaps, a pair of suter‘s auld shoon, greased blackand made new again, to make his feet feasiblelike, as he kend the lass would look at them (forhis mither tell’d him the women looked ay tothe mens legs or they married them, and theweel-legged loons gade ay best aff.)So Sawny came swaggering through a the*shell wives, but she was no there, going downthe town below the guard he met auld Be-gojust in the teeth, an she cries, Hey laddie mydow, how’s > our mither honest Mary ? Thankyou, quo’ Sawny, she’s meat hale, aye workingsome—how’s a at hame, is Kate and the laddieweel ?Matty. Fu’ weel, my dow: ye’re a brawsonsy dog grown, a wallie fa’me gin I kend ye.Come, come, quo’ Sawny, and I’ll gie ye anossack to heat your wame, it is a cauld day,and ye’re my mither’s countrywoman.Na, fair fa’you, Sawny, I’ll nae refus’t; adram’s better the day than a clap on the arse wi’a cauld shule, sae follow me, my dow.So awa’ she took me, quo’ Sawny, down adark stair, to ane o’ the houses beneath the yird^where it was mirk as in a coal heugh, and theyhad a great fire. Sweet be wi me quo’ Sawny, forit minds me of the ill part; an a muckle pot hasa little cauldron, seething kail and roasting flesh,the wife forked them out as fast us she could into11Icoags and caps, for there came in a wheen tutorlike fallows, with black thumbs and creeshy ap¬rons, that cutted them all up in a wee time, butthey never fashed with us, nor we with them; wefirst got a gill, and then got a het pint. A vowquoth I, Matty, is Kate gaun to get a man yet?Matty. A man laddie, wha wad hae her ? amuckle, lazy, useless jade; she can do naethingbut work at husband wark, card and spin, wash! ladies rooms, and a gentleman’s bonny things:! she canna tak a creel on her back, and apply toi: merchandizing as I do, to wun a man’s bread.Sawny. I think some of the fishers and heri might mak it up.Matty. A fisher, laddie 1 haith the fishers wadI rather hae a pickle good bait to their hooks, andtwa three bladders to their lines, than put up wi’the like of her, a stinking prideful jade, altho’ Ibore her, ay scourin and washin at hersel, prickinand prinnin keeps, her face ay like a Flander’sbaby, and naeless than ribbons and rings, and heri shoon made of red clouts; a devil stick pride,' when our auld guidams ran barefoot, and our! gutchers gade wi bare hips. Gie her a man ! illthief stap a gouk in her arse first, that may crycuckow when e’er she speaks o’t; she can do nae-I thing but scour ladies pishpots, and keep cleanI the tirlie-wherlies that hang about the fire : haith12she’s o’er gentle brought up to be a poor man spenny-worth.Heigh how, quo’ Sawny, and ’tis e’en a greatpity, for she’s weel-far’d lusty hissie; he had agreat kindness for her.Matty. A well-a-wat she’s no lingletailed, shemay he a caff bed to a good fallow, but an thouhad but seen me at her age, I was a sturdy gim-mer; there was nae a Hynd in a Dubbyside couldlay a corpen to a creel wi me, the fint a fallowin a Fife but I wad a laid on the bread of hishack, and a’ his gear uppermost, I was na a chick¬en to chatter wi indeed laddie, for I had a flanklike an ox, and a pair of cheeks like a chapmansarse.Sawny. Nae doubt but ye had a pair of beefybuttocks, for your very cheeks kings like leatherhags to this day; but I’ll tell you what I’m gaunto tell you—do ye think that your Kate wad takme, an I would come to court her ?Matty. Tak you, laddie, tak you, faith she’lltak you, for she would tane a poor button thingof a half blind tailor, wartna me, a poor, blind,howly, scabbit like creature; I’ve seen the day Iwad hae carried him in my pouch. Wode I’sewarrant her jump at you, like a fish at a flee, wadI say tak you, and she winna tak you, I’se takyou mysel, but she an I cust out the day about13i her cockups and black caps, gat'd me say muckle: of her; but she's my sonsy dawty for a that;‘i weel-a wat she's a weel-natured lassie, and ginI she turn an illnatured wife I canna tell.Sawny. A well then I’ll venture on her as[i she is, for my mither’s pleased; an ye’re pleased,I an I’m pleased; wode I am sure to get her, an! the taylor has nae bridled her; or tane a tryingtrot o’ her.Matty. But Sawny, man, I’ll tell you what1 we’ll do, I’ll hame and broach her the night on’t,« an come ye the morn, w'e’ll mak it fu’ fast in aj'l wee time, so thou’s get mair tocher than a Cram-< on, gammon to gammon; she has baith blankets, and sheets, a covering, and twa cods o’ caff, ap! caff bed and bowster, and hear’st thou’ my laddie,I I hae a bit auld hogger, and something in’t, thou’st get it when I die; but by my sooth it will be the, last thing that I’ll part wi’, I kenna what I mayli need yet—it is an auld wife that kens her ain weird,ji On this they paid their spout and parted ; butI when Sawny came out, he stoited and staggeredil like a sturdy stot: molash was chief commander,i| for Sawny thought every body had twa headsi and four een, and more noses than they neededj\ while in the dark house he sometimes thought itwas the morning of a new day : a hech, said he,p when was I a night frae my mither before; she'll14think 1 am put in the guaixi, tane \vi‘ the deil omthe doctors, or else married, and working at thtlwanton trade of weans making.Matty. Hute, daft laddie, the soup drink's in|your head, and gars ye think sae, this day and!yesterday is ae day: ye‘11 be hame in braw timeyet.Sawny. A well, a well then, good day to you, igood mither ; ye maun gar Kate tak me, or thieftak you a thegither : I’ll hame and tell the length :it’s come, and if it comes nae farther, it maun e’enstick there.Off he goes, tacking about like a ship against Ithe wind, as if he would knock holes in the walls !and windowss wi‘ his elbows ; he looked as fierce |as a lion, with a red face like a trumpeter, and his Inose was like a bubbly jock's neb, as blue as ablawart: but or he wan half way hame his headturned heavier than his heels and mony a filthyfa' he got, through thick and thin he plashed, tillhame he gets at last, grunting and gaping bythe wall, when auld Mary thought it was theirnibours sow, he was sae bedaubed wi dirt; by thetime she got him to bed, he was in a boiling-bar¬rel fever, and poor Mary grat wi grief.Sawny. Hech, hey ! but courting be a curst,wark, and costly too: an marrying be as morti¬fying and murdering, the deil be married for me.15Mither. Wa Sawny^ man, what’s come o’er(thee now ? thou hast gotten skaith, some auldwife has witcht thee, or the deil has dung theeo’er in some dirty midden; where hast thou been,or what hast thou seen; thae een reel like a wildcat’s, and the sweat is hailing o’er thy nose;thou’s witcht, thou’s witch’t, O man, what willIdo.Bock, bock, gaed Sawney; but it could naItvin up for bubbles and herrin banes. Oh, quo’iihe, keep me in my bed for my days will soon be■ done; a curse on your courting wark, for it hasilled me, and wives are but wicked things, Ien by the same.Mither. O dole, dole, my bairn has gottenoison, for the smell of it is like to poison me.Sawny. Gin herring and het ale be poison,here’ll no be mony left alive. Bock, bock, Oh,uo, Sawney the bed’s filed!Mither. O my bairn, thou was ay a cleanlybairn till now; thou’s surely lost thy senses whenhou files where thou lies, like the brute beasts:thou never did the like of this before since thouleft rocking of the cradle.PART IIIPoo it Sawny had a terrible night o’t, wi asair head and a sick heart, his eyes stood in hislhead, his wame, caddied like ony cow’s milks, andpuddings crocket like a wheen puddocks in apool; his mither rocket and wrung her hands,crying, a wae be to the wife that brewed it, forI hae lost a weel foster’d bairn wi’ their stinkingstuff, a meikle deil ding the doup out of their icaldron, my curse come on them and their whisky-pots, it’s brunt him alive; ay, ay, my bairn he’sgone.But about the break of day, his wind braklikethe bursting of a bladder, O happy deliverance,cried Mary his miiher ; tho’ dirt bodes luck, andfoul farts file the blankets, I wish ne’er waur beamong us. The next thing that did Sawnygood, was three mutchkins of milk made intothin brose, and a pickle fine pepper in them, yethe had a soughing in his lugs like a saw-mill,and every thing gade round about wi’ him a’ thatday ; his mither gat him out of bed, and put himin the muckle chair wi a’ pair of blankets abouthis shoulders, a cod at his back, and a het brickto his soles, to gar him trow he was nae well,and there he sat like a lying-in wife, crackinglike a Holladdie, and ate twa dead herrin’ anda crust, telling a the outs and ins about the bri¬dal, and when it was to be, for he had gottenevery body’s consent but the bride’s about it.17Mither. But Sawny, man, that’s the mainthing ; ye maun hae that too.Sawny. Na, na, mither, I’m the main thingyself, aye she’s but a member; the men maunye be foremost—gang what way it will, I’se ayee uppermost.Mither. But Sawny man, what way is thougaun to do ? will ye make a penny wedding; orwa or three gude neebours, a peck of meal ba¬ton, wi a cheese and a barrel of ale; will that do ?Sawny. Na na mither, I’ll take a cheapergate nor ony of them; I’ll gar-a-crown and half\ mutehkin, or a rake of coals do it a’, then ai oody has nae mair to do but piss and tumble intobed.Mither. Na na, my man Sawny, I hae mony11 time heard thy honest father say, that never amne would do well that capstrided the kirk orijjuckold the minister.Sawny. A tell nae me, mither, of the minis-Jter, they’re aye for their ain end as well as itherjrfouk, and if a poor beggar body had a bit wean(O christen, the deil a beit they-11 feike him o’t.i Mither. Hute awa man, there’s na body has'weans but what has siller to pay the christening;>f them ; or if they be that poor, they sudna get;iiae weans, and they wadna be fashed syne.Sawny, Ha ha mither, the poor fouk, likethe lice, ay when they meet they marry, and mak:|rmae of them; and I think the ministers mighfchristen their bits of weans for naething, tht 1water's no sae scant; they are weel paid for theitpreaching, they may very weel baith marry andchristen a’ the poor fouks into the bargain, bythe way of a maggs.Mither. Ay, ay, my man Sawny, marriage ii ■a sweet thing for young fouk, and the bed un- 'defiled.Sawny. What the vengeance, yiither, do yethink a body’s to file the bed every night becausethey did it ance.Mither. Na, na that’s no what I mean; it isthe happiness that fouk hae that’s married, besidethe lonesome life that I hae, lying tumbling andgaunting in a bed my lane: O sirs, but a man inbed be a useful body, an it were but to claw anesback, as for a body’s foreside they can claw itthemselves.Sawny. Ah mither, mither, ye hae fun a stringagain; I think ye might a wanted all your days,when ye hae wanted sae lang; ye hae plenty ofbaith milk and meal, snuff and tobacco; but yesmell at the crack of a whip, I kend my mitherwad ride yet, for I’ve seen her fit waggan thislang time.Mither. A dear Sawny man, an thou were19tj ance fairly aft’ the fodder, I’ll be cast into a holejof a house by mysel, where I’ll just lye andbreak my heart, and weary myself to death; buti an I could get a bit honest weaver, a cobbler, orsome auld tailor by the tail, I would tackle to himyet, let the country clash as they please about ifSawny. A well, a well mither, tak your ainflight, there’s nae fool like an auld fool; tor themorn I’ll be aff or on wi’ the hissie I hae in hand.iSo on the morrow Sawny got all his claes clean¬ed, his hair earned and greased with butter, andhis face as clean as if the cat had licked it, andaway he goes singing.I will buy a pound of woo’,I will wash’t and mak a plaidy,I’m gaun ower the muir to ■woo’,Carlin, is your daughter ready.Now poor Sawny, although he sang, he wasas pale as a ghost from the grave ; his face waswhitely white, like a weel bleached dishclout,and he looked as if he had been eaten and spuedagain ; but at length he came to the bride’s door,and in he goes with a brattle, crying, how’s allhere the day ? and what’s corned of thy mitherlassie? O Saunders, quo the bride she’s awa to! the town : what came of ye yesterday, she waited20on you the whole day, ye gart her lose a daytrade lad, and she is awa this morning cursin;|like a heathen, and swearing Be-go that ye hagien her the begunk.Sawny. A dole woman, I took a sudden blaiin the hame gaun and was never sae near dead imy life.And wha think you was in company wi Katethe bride, but the wee button of a tailor, who saland sewed on a table, cocking like a t—d ontrencher; but when he kent wha was come, heleaped down on the floor, coost a dash of pridelike a little bit prince, bobbet about, and so outhe goes, with the tear in his eye, and his tail between his feet, like a half worried dog.Sawny. Now, Katie, do ye ken what I’mcorned about?Kate. O yes, my mither tell£d me : but 1‘mno ready yet, I hae twa gowns to spin and thingsto make.Sawny. Hute, things to make, ye hae asmony things as ye‘ll need, woman ; cannayespingowns in your ain house wi me, as weel as here,wi an auld girning mither ?Kate. But dear Saunders, ye maun gie abody time to think on£t—£twad be ill-fai*d to rushthe gither just at the first.Sawny. And do ye think I hae naething adobut come here every ither day hoiting1 after you,it will no do ! I maun be either aff or on wi’ you,either tak me or tell me, for I ken of ither twa,and some of you I’ll hae, for as I’m a sinner, myimither is gaun to be married too, an she can getiDny bit man of ony shape or trade.Kate. Indeed, theny Saunders, since you’ren such haste, ye maun e’en tak them that’s read-est, for I’m no ready yet.Sawny. Dear woman, when your mither and.y mither s pleased, and I am willing to venturen ye, what a sorrow ails you ?Kate. Na, na, 111 think on’t twa or threelays; its o’er lang a term to see without a’ ought.Sawny. Wode I think ye’re a camstrerie piecef stuff; its true enough what your mither said»f ye, that ye’re no for a poor man.Kate. And what mair said she of me ?Sawny. Wode, she said ye could do naethingmt wash mugs, and scour gentleman’s bonnythings, but hissies that is bred amang gentlelouses, minds me of my mither’s cat; but ye’recostlier to keep, for the cat wastes neitherpe nor water, but spits in her loof, and washeser ain face, and wheens of you can do nae ither'ng; and up he gets.22Kate. O Saunders, but ye be short, can y<no stay till my mither come hame ?Sawny. I’ve staid lang enough for ony thingI ’ m to be the better; and I’m nae sae short asyour totum of a tailor, that I could stap in myshoe, sae could I e’en.Hame he goes in a passion, and to his bed heran, crying, O death! death! I thought the jadewad a jumped at me : no comfort nor happinessmair for me. O mither, gae bake my burialbread, for I’ll die this night, or soon the morn.But early next morning in comes auld Be-go hisguid mither, wha had left her daughter in tearsfor slighting of Sawny, and hauls him and hisimither awa’ to get a dinner of dead fish ; wherea’ was agreed upon, and the wedding to be uponWednesday, no bridal fouks but the twa mithers,and themselves twa.So according to appointment, they met atEdinburgh, where Sawny got the cheap priest,wha gave them twa three words, and twa three:lines, took their penny and a guid drink, wishedthem joy, and gade his wa’s. Now, said auldBe-go, if that be your minister, he’s but a drunk¬en b—h, mony a ane drinks up a’, but he leavesnaething; he’s got the penny for diel a hate, yemight cracket lufes on’t, tane ane anither’s word,a kiss and a hoddle at a hillock side, and been as23eel, if no better: I hae seen some honest manHay mair o’er their brose nor what he said a’ thether ; but an ye be pleased, I’m pleased; aboutthe bed ends a’, and makes sure wark—soere’s to you, and joy to the bargain its endedw, well I wat.\21ANECDOTE.Lewis XI. although an unprincipled Prince,( of whom it was remarkable, that he did not |scruple to perjure himself, except when he swonby the leaden Image of the Virgin) was yet veryattentive to every circumstance that could in¬crease the wealth and happiness of his subjects^He behaved with the greatest affability to suchmerchants whose superior knowledge could sug¬gest any means of extending the benefits of com¬merce ; and that he might engage them to bemore communicative, he frequently invited themto his table. A merchant, named Mr. John in¬toxicated by the familiarity of the King, whovery often admitted him in particular to dine withhim, took it in his head one day, to request hisMajesty to grant him letters of nobility. TheKing did not refuse his request; but when thenew nobleman appeared at court, he affected notto know him. Mr. John, surprised at this unex¬pected reception, could not forbear complainingof it: “ Go about your business, Mr. John, Imean my Lord,” said the Xing: “ When I usedto invite you to my table, I considered you asthe first of your profession ; but now I wouldinsult my nobles, if I would treat you with thesame distinction.” ->rTHE END.X

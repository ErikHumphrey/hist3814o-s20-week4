NowI began to reflect on the bad eflfefts of drinking, and .own all the miferies juft that were come up n me.In the night the pigs came grunting very kindly a-bout me, thinking, I was fome ftiend of their mo¬ther’s come to fee them. They gave me very littlereft always kifling me with their cauld fnouts, whichemu fed me to rung them off with my flick, then theymade fuch a terrible noife that their mother came toargument the matter, running upon me with openmouth; but I gave her fuch a whack over the langfnout that flic roared out murder in her own lan¬guage, that alarmed the.fervantg, who cak ie to feewhat was the matter; 1 told them their old fow wasgoing to fwallow me up, alive, and bade them goand fetch her fome meat, which they did, and thebr^ute became more peaceable.On the Sabbath morning 1 cvne into the houfe,.the goodman alked me if I could fliave any ; yes,faid I, but never do on the Sabbath-day: I fancyfaid he, you’re fome waftland wig.

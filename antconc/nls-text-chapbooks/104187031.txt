father, or faw ye my mother,Or law ye my true-love John ?I faw not your father, I faw not your mother,But I faw your true-love John.*Tis now ten at night, and the ftars gi’e nae light.And the bells they ring ding dong;He’s met wi’ fome delay, that caufeth him to flay,But he will be here ere long.The furly auld carl did naething but fnarl,And Johny’s face it grew red ;Yet tho’ he often figh’d, he ne’er a word repli’d.Till all were afleep in bed.Up Johny rofe, and to the door he goes,And gently tirlcd the pin;The laflie taking tent, unto the door fhe went,And flic open’d and let him in.And are ye come at laft, and do I hold ye fafl ?And is my Johny true !I have nae time to tell, but fae lang’s 1 like myfell,Sae lang fhall I love you.Flee up, flee up, my bonny grey cock,And craw when it is day ;Your neck fhall be like the bonny beaten gold,And your wings of the filver grey.The cock prov’d falfe, and untrue he was.For he crew an hour o’er foon,The laflie thought it day, when fhe fent her love away.}And it was but a blink of the moon.( y )Pretty N API Cr.PRet’y Nancy of London, in Leaden-hall Street,W s courted by Billy on board of the fleer,A c! when that thefe Itormy winds begin for

where the hurricanes blow.'A fhip in diflrefs is a mofl terrible fight.Like an army of foldiers juft going to light.A foldier can fiiun his moft terrible doom,Whilll a faiior lubmits to a watery ttmb.It was late in the evening before it was dark.Our honoured captain he (hew’d us a mark,Offumthing that he could difeern in the fkies,Ot a terrible (term that was going to rife.It roared like thunder, it tofs’d us about,While many a bold faiior, both gallant and flout.Stood trembling and quaking ’twixt hope and defpairOne moment below and another in the air.Early in the morning before it was day,Our honoured captain then to us did fay,Le not afraid, brave boys, but be of good chear,While we’ve good fea-rocm, we’ve nought for to fearBut when the wind blows it makes my heart to akcIt makes all our cabins and rooms for to lhake;But what can I do fo far from the Hiore ?1 think on my true love, what esu 1 do mope.i( 6 )POLLY, 0- L I V E R.AS Polly lay muting one night on her bed,A comical ditty came into her head ;Neither father nor mptber tlnll make me talie prove,I’ll lift tor a foldier and follow my love.Early in tiie morning mifs Polly arofe,And drtflecl hert'elf trt'a'fwt ot man’s clothes.Coat, w/iftcoat and breeches, with ifword by her fide,On her father's brave gelding like a trobper d d ride.• She rode till the came to fair Stafford town,And there the difmounted at the fign of the Crown ;Tiie firft man the law was an Englifhman bold,The next was a.captain, Polly Oliver’s love. »Says Polfy. here’s a letter I brought from your dear.Says Polly, berets a letter I brought from your dear;And in the fame letter there’s a guinea and a crown,For you and your foldiers to drink her health round.Then fupper being over, Polly harg down her head,She call’d for a candle to light her to bed ;No fays the captain, I’ve a bed at my cafe,And you«may Ik along with mej S:r, if you pleafe.To lie with my captain ia adang«fous thing;I’m a new lifted foldier to fight for my king ;To.ftghtfor my king, boys, by fea and by land,And tho’ you’re my captain, 1 ’m not at your command.So early in the morning young Polly arefe, ~And drefi’rl herfelf in her own female clothes ;And as hie came down from the chambers above.She cry’d, Fm Polly Oliver your loyal true love.\ The captain he blufh’d ?nd hang down his head,iAt>d then with a ring they were married indeed,Had yon lain with me the firft night the fault hadbeen mine.I’ll firive.to pleafe'yoii better, love now in my time.' ?( 7 )THU ROT’s DEFEAT.FRom Dunkirk in France in the month of Septemberfhted out was a fleet and away they ciiti fail,And Monfielir Tr urot being their commander,They liad for their headfmao, vvere-fure not to fail, jSo away they did fleer without dread or f*ar,' They robbed and plunder’d all (hips that they found,Until that they came up by the ebafl of Ireland,Aud landed their men upon the Infh ground.It was at Carrick-fergus in the north of that kingdom,they landed their men and march’d up-to their walls;Then cry’d ont the brave Col’nel Jennings,my boys let’s falute them wbh powder and b*llr.So the battle began and the guns they did rattle,and bravely they fought under Jehning’j'command.Says he, play away, [Jay on, my brave boys,The Monfieurs the force of our fire cannot (land.The town they did take without any refiflance,the caflle they thought was as eafy liketvife:They came marching up in three grand divifiods,but guarded it was by the brave' Irifli buys.They kept conflant fire and made them retire,’till their ammunition entirely was done;Then aloud he did fay, my boys, let’s away,and we’ll fally out upon them fword in hand.But then, fays our general, how can vve defend it ?for to make a fally it is but in vain ;As our ammunition entirely is ended,therefore we’ll fubmit and good terms obtain :For plainly you fee, for one there is-three,therefore it is better to capitulate;If they take it by florrn then by the law <»f arms,death without mercy (hall fare be our fate.( 8 )So the Monfieur* obtained poflefli m of Carricif, 'where they lay a fnoring and drinking a whi e,The people they forely did ranlack and plunder,and hoihed it all on board the Beleifle.Bat brave Elliot met them,not away he would let thensfjbut made them yield back their ill gotten (lore ; iSo Moaficttr laments in the dtepefl condition, .for now they can brag of their Thurot no more.Let us praile brave Elliot who gained this aftion,and frng to h 8 praife in the joyfulif (1 fottg,That we of our foes have got fatisfafliun,and Thurot Ijes rotting rear the llle of Man. --Their general is wounded, their i'chemes are confoundetii,the bold Britilh tars they can never withftand,The fire of the fierce and bold Britilh Lion,appeared to them under brave Captain Bland.So now for to bring my fong to conclufion,let us drink a health to our officers all,To noble Col’neljenning*, 1 kewife Bland our captain,and never forgetting the brave Mr Hall.Let’s be blithe and jolly, and drown melancholy,fo merrily let us rejoice and fing;Come fill up your bowls all ye loyal fouls,and drink a health to great George our King.FINIS.

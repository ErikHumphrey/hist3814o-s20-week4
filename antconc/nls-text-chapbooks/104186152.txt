like an eel.iTHEDominie Depos’d.PART 1.Some Dominies are sae biass’d,Thai o’er the dyke themselis they cast,.They drink an’ rant, an’ live sae fast,This drives them onTo draw a weapon at the last,That sticks Mess John.Thus going on from day to day,Neglecting still to watch and pray,And teach the little anes A, B, C,An’ Pater Noster,Quite ither thoughts our LettergacBegins to foster. .For, laying bye baith fear and shame,They silly venture on that game,All fours I think they c-all't by name,Baith auld an’ rife,That in the play Mess John is slainWi’ his ain knife.’Tis kend, therefore I winna striveMy doughty deeds here to descrive,A lightsome life still did I drive,Did never itch,By out an’ in abouts to drive^For to mak rich.4<I ne’er laid money up in store,Into a hole behind the door,A shilling, penny, less or more,I did it scatter;Tis just, now, I should drink, therefore,Sma’ beer or water.I never sooner siller got,But a’ my pouches it would, plot,And scorch them sair, it was sae hot •,Then to get clearOf it, I swill’d it down tny throat,In ale or beer.Thus, a* my failing was my glass,An’ anes, to please a bonny lass,T, like a silly amorous ass.Drew forth my gully,An’ thro’ an* thro’ at the first pass »Ran Mr. Willy.Sae for this mad though merry fit,I was sair vex’d, and forc’d to flit.They plagu’d me sae wp pay and fit.Quo’ they, You thief,How durst you try to steal a bitForbidden beef ?/ ■ %O then I humbly plead that vosWould make it your continual mos,Wi’ hearts sincere an’ open og,You’d often pray,.d tali malo libra nos,O Domine.5For, hark, I’ll tell you what they think.Since I left handling pen an’ ink,Wae worth that weary soup o’ drinkHe lik’d sae weel,He drank it a’, left not a clinkHis throat to swill.He lik’d, still sitting on his doup,To view the pint or cutty stoup,And sometimes lasses overcoupUpo’their keels ; 'This made the lad at length to loup,And tak his heels.Then was it not a grand presumptionTo ca’ him Doctor o’ the function ?He dealt too much in barley-unctionFor his profession:He never took a good injunctionFrae kirk or session.And to attend he was not willing,His school, sae lang’s he had a shilling,But lov’d to be where there was fillingGood punch or ale;For him to rise was just like killing,Or first to fail.His fishing wand, his sneeshing box,A fowlirg-piece, to shoot muir-cocks.And hunting hares thro’ craigs and rocks.This was his game,Still left the young anes, so the foxMight worry them.6When he committed all these tiicks,For which he weel deserv’d his licks,Wi’ red coats he did intermix,When he foresawThe punishment the kirk inflictsOn fowks that fa’.Then to his thrift he bade adieu,When wi’ his tail he stopp’d his mou’.He chang’d his coat to red and blue.And like a sotDid the poor Clerk convert intoA Royal Scot.And now fowks use me at their wills.My name is blawn out-o*«r the hills.At banquets, feasts, a’ mouths it fills,’Twixtaach here’s t’thee.It’s sore traduc’d at kilns and milns,And common smithy.Then Dominies, I you beseech,Keep very far from Bacchus’ reach,He drowned a’ my cares to preach,Wi’ his maut bree.I’ve wore sair banes by mony a bleechO’ his tap-tree:If Venus does possess your mind,Her anticks ten times warse ye’ll find,For to ill tricks she’s ay inclin’d,For proticks past.She blew me here before the wind ;Cauld be her cast.1Within years Jess than half a dizen,She made poor Maggy lie in jizen.When little Jack brake out o’ prisonOn gude Yule-day,This of my quiet cut the wizen,When he wan gae.Let readers, then, tak better heed,For fear they kiss mair than they read,In case they wear the sacken-weedFor fornication,Or leave the priest-craft.shot to deadFor procreation.The maist o’ them, like blind an’ lame,Have nae aversion to the game,But better ’twfere to tak her name,Their pot to cook,And teach his boys to write a theme,And mind their book.Then may they sit at hame and pleaseThemselis wi’ gathering in their fees,While I must face mine enemies,Or shaw my dock ;There’s odds’twixt handling pens wi’ easeAnd a firelock.Sae shall they never mount the stool.Whereon the lasses greet and howl,Tho’ deil a tear, scarce fair or foul,Comes o’er their cheeksTheir mind?s not there, ’tis spinning wool,Or mending breeks.8The Kirk then pardons no such prots,They must tell down good five pounds ScotsTho’ they should pledge their petticoat^And gae arse bare ;The least price there is twenty groats,And prigging sair.If then the lad does not her wed,Poor Meg some feigned tears maun shed.Her minny crooks her mou’ and dad.They fart and fling :<< O wow that ere I made the bed,”Then does she sing.Thus for her Maidenhead she moans.Bewailing what is past;Her pitcher’s dash’d against the stones.And broken at the last.PART II.A’ maids, therefore, I do bemoan,Betwixt the rivers Dee and Don,If anes they get a lick o’ yon,Tho’ by the laird,The toy-mutch maun then gae on,Nae mair bare-hair’d.Yet wanton Venus, that she bitch,Does a’ our senses sae bewitch,An’ fires our blood wi’ sic an itch,That aftentimes,There is nae help but to commitSome ill-far’d crimes.9Yet some they *re sac very willing,At ony time they’ll tak a shilling,But ha that learnt them first that spelling,Or Meg or Neil,Be sure, to him they’ll lay an egg in,This some can tell.Unthinking things 1 it is their creed.If some sic things be done wi’ speed.They’re safe, ’tis help in time of need,Nae after claps;Tho’ niris months aft brings quick or deadInto their laps.Experience thus makes me to speak,I ance was hooked wi’ the cleek,I almost had beshit my breekWhen Maggy toldThat, by her snul, not e’en a weekYoung Jack would holdShe was sae stiff she could not lout *,Your pranks, she says, are now found out,The Kirk and you maun ha^ a bout;III mat ye fare :’Tis a’your ain, ye need na doubt,Ilk hilt and hair.Alas ! that e’er I saw your face,I can nae langer hide the case ;£Iad I forseen this sad disgrace,Nae man nor youShou’d e’er hae touch’d my sic a place.Or kiss’d my mou’.10f) Dominie, you're dispossessYe hae beshi*: your holy nest.The warld sees ye hae transgrest;I’m at my time.Ye dare h'ae mair, now do your best,Let gae the rhyme*Ohon ! how wed I might hae kent.When first to yon I gae consent,Wi’ me to make your merriment.How a’ would be :Alas ! that e’er my loom I lent■s That day to thee.Wae to the night I first beganTo mix my nioggans wi’ thee, man ;’Tis needless now to curse or ban,But deil hae me,Ye’ll pay, and fit, for fit ye can,And that ye’ll see.I heard her as I heard her not,But time and place had quite forgot,I guess’d my piece was in the pot,For I could tell.It was too short her petticoatBy half an ell.WI’ blubber’d cheeks, and watery nose,Her weary story she did close;I said the best, and aff 1 goesJust like a thief,And took a glass to interpose’Twixt mirth and grief.liYet v/ou’d hae glen my half year’s fee.Had Maggy then been jesting me.Had tartan purry, meal an’ bree,Or butt’ry brose.Been kilting up her petticoatsAboon her hose.But time, that tries such praticks past,Brought me out o’er the coals fu’ fast;Poor Maggy took a sudden blastAn’ o’er did tumble,For something in her wame, at last,Began to rumble.Our fouk caud it the windy gravel.That grips the guts beneath the navel,But faith she was for to unravelTheir gross mistake,Weel kend she, that she was in travelWi’ little Jack.But, to put matters out of doubt,Young John within wou’d fain been out,An’ but an’ ben made sic a routWi’ hands an’ feet,That she began, twa-fald, aboutThe house to creep.Then dool an’ sorrow' interveen’d;For Jack nae langer cou’d be screen^;My lass upon her breast she lean’d,An’ gae a skirl !The canny wives came there conveen’dA’ in a whirl.12They wrought together in a croud;By this time I was.under cloud;Yet bye an’ bye I understood.They made one moreFor Jack he tun’d his pipe, an’ loudWi’ cries did roar!Wi’ that they blam’d the Session-Clark;Where is the lown hid in the dark ?For he’s the father o’ this wark:Swear to his mither,He’s just as like him as ae larkIs like anither.About me then there was a din,They sought me out thro’ thick and thin,Wi’ deil hue her, and ceil hae him.He’s o’er the dyke;Our Dominie has now dung inHis arse a-peek.Ye may weel jndge I was right sweer,This uncouth meeting to draw near.Yet forc’d I was then to appear,Altho’ perplex’d;But listen now, an’ ye shall hear,The haggs me vex’d.Tne carlings Maggy had so cleuked,Before young Jack was rightly hooked,They made her twice as little booked,But to gae on,O then ! how like a fool I looked,When I saw John13The Cummer then came to me bent,An’ gravely did my Son present •,She bade me kiss him, be content,Then wish’d me joyAn’ taad it was—what luck had sent, -'A waly boy.In ilka member, lith an’ Ilm’,Its mouth, its nose, its cheeks, its chin,'Tis a’ like daddy, just like him,His very self,Tho’ it look’d canker’d, sour an’ grim,Like ony elf.Then whisp’ring low, to me she harked,Indeed your hips they shou’d be yarked.Nae mair Mess John, nor dare ye clarkit,Faith ye hae ca’dYour hogs unto a bonny marketIndeed my lad.But tell me, man, I shou’d say master,What muckle deil in your way chas’d her ?Lowns baith! but I think I hae plac’d herNow on her side}My coming here has not disgrac’d her,At the Yule tide.An* for yoursell, ye dare na lookHereafter ever on a book.Your mou’ about the psalms to crook:Ye’ve play’d the foolAnither now your post maun bruik,An’ you the stool.14She banil’d her saul, and then she blest it.In the Kirk-boolt's it would be listed;An* thus the weary wife insisted.Our LettergaeWill sit vvhar he will not be pisht atBy dogs some day.She wrung her hands until they cracked,An* sadly me she sham’d an’ lacked—Ah man! the Priest, how will he tak it,Whan he hears tell.How Maggy’s mitten ye hae glaiket.Ye ken yoursell.The Session Clark to play sic prankres.Ye’ll stan’, I fear, upo’ your shankies.An’ may be slaver in the brankies;It cou’dna miss,But lifting Maggy’s callimankies» W ou’d turn to this.A touthless Houdy, auld and tough,Says, Cummer, husht, vi e hae aneugh,Phirsh mony ane has touch’tvthe pieugh,Ash gude ash he,An’ yetch gane backlench o’er the heugh,Sae let him be.Hesh no, quoth she, tho’ he’sh be lear’d,That ye ken what, they hae crept near’t,For you an’ I hash aftimes heardO’ nine or ten,Wha thush the Clergy hath beshmear’dWi’ their ain Pen..15The'auld rr.ou’d wives thus did. me taunt,Tho’ a’ was true, I must needs grant.But ae thing maistly made me faint,Poor Meg lay still.An’ look’d as loesome as a saintThat kend nae ill.Then a’ the giglc - young and gaudy,Sware by their sauls, I might be wady.For getting “ic a iusty laduy,Sae like mysell;An’ made me blush wi' speaking.baudy,’Bout what befel.Thus auld and young their verdict had,’Bout Maggy’s being broup^ht to bed ;I thought my fill, yet little said,Or had to say,To reap the fruit o’ sic a tradeOn gude Yule-dayWhat sometimes in the mou’ is sweet,Turns bitter in the warns ;I grumbl’d sair to get the geet,At sic a merry time.PART III.Now Maggy’s twasome in a swoon,A counsel held condemns the lown,The cushle mushle thus gaed roun ,Our bonny Clark,He’ll get the dud an’ sacken gown,That ugly sark.16Consider, sir^ how this his crime,’Tis no like hers, or yours, or mine.He’s just next thing to a divine,An' wow, ’tis odd,Sic men shou'd a' their senses tine,An' fear o' God.’ Fis strange what makes kirk-fouk sae stupit,To mak or meddle wi’ the fuca’it,Or mint to preach in sic a pu’pit.The senseless fools:Far better for them hunt the tyouchet,Or teaeh their schools.They hunt about frae house to house,Just as a taylor hunts a louse,Still girding at the barley-juice.An’ aft get drunk,They plump into some open sluice,Where a’ is sunk.A plague upo’ that oil o’ ma’t,That weary drink is a’ their fau’t,It made our Dominie to hau’t;The text fulfil,Which bids cast out the sa’tless sa’tTo the dunghill.They are sae fed, they lie sae saft,They are sae hain’d, they grow sae daft;This breeds ill wiles, ye ken, fu? aftIn the black coat,Till poor Mess John, an’ the priest-craftGaes ti’ the pot.17 .I tald them, then, it was but wicked,To add affliction to the afflicted ;But to it they were so addicted,, They said thereforeThe clout about me should be prickedAt the Kirk door.But yet yet nor Kirk nor Cons’terie,Quoth they, can ask the taudry fee;Tell me in words just twa or three,The deil a plack,For tary-breeks shou’d ay gae free,An’ he’s the Clark.I then was dumb •, how I was griev’d!What wou’d I gien to be reliev’d !They us’d me waur than I had thiev’d,Some strain’d their lungAnd very loud they me mischiev’dWi’ their ill tongues.Had you been there to hear an’ see,.The manner how they guided me ;An’ greater pennance wha cou’d dree !A Lettergae,Wi’ sic a pack confin’d to be,On gudo Yule-day.Young Jack wi’ skirls he pierc’d the skies,I pray’d that death might close his eyes,But did not meet with that surprise,To my regret,Sae had nae help, but up and triesHet drinks to get.18This laid their din, the drink was stale,And to’t they gaed jvi’ tooth and nail;And wives whase rotten tusks did fail,Wi’ bread and cheese;They bill’d fu’ fast at butter’d aleTo gi’e them ease.They ca’ upon me, then dadda,Come tune your fiddle, play us aJigg or hornpipe, nae mair SOL FA,My bonny cock;The Kirk an’ you maun pluck a fa’Abount young Jock.Play up, Sae merry as we hae been,Or, Wat ye wha we met yestreen ?Or, Lass will ye lend me your leem POr, Soups o’ Brandy ;Or, Gin the Kirk wad let’s alane,Or, Houghmagandy.Sic tunes as these, yea, three or four.They called for, ill mat they cour!Play, cries the cummer, wi’ a glour,The wanton toudy,Wha did the Dominie ding o’er,Just heels o’er goudy.O’ music I had little skill,But as I cou’d I play’d my fill,It was my best to shaw good will;Yet a’ my drift,Was best how I might wir the hillThe wives to shift.19Sae leaving them to drink her ale,I sling’d awa’ and let them rail:Then running till my breath did fail,I was right glad|Frae Kirk an’ wives to tak leg-bail.—Nae doubt they said,The Lettergae has play’d the fool,'And shifted the Repenting Stool;To Kirk and Session bids good-day,iiHe’11 o’er the hills and far away.I

mae I had anew,'For 1 had neither horse nor cow;i My stock took wings an’ aff it flew;'Sae a’ was gone,An’ deil a flee had I was new,Except young John-.20Too aft my thirsty-throat to cool,I went to visit the punch bowl,Which makes me now wear reddish woolInstead o' black;Or I must foot the cutty-stoolWi’ deil a plack.Thechappen stoup, the pint an’ gill,Too aft I caused for to fill,Ay loving those wha wou’d sit still,An’ wet the mouth,Ne’r minding that the Tullo-hill,Leads people south.O but that loving laird Kingswells,My blessings flow where his foot swells,Lang hfe to him whate’er

cast up,When we again shall meet,To drown our sorrows in a cup,In case we live to see’t.THE ENDELEGYONMAGGY SIMPSON,..iWho died Anno 1711.jl A ULD Reeky mourn in sable hue,Let routh o’ tears dreep like xVIay-dew,Lo braw tippeny bid adieuWhich we wi’ greed,ended as fast as she cou’d brew,But now she’s dead.li22To tell the truth now, Maggy dangO’ customers she had a bang;- For lairds an’ sutors a’ did thrangTo drink badeen;The barn an’ yard was aft sae thrangWe took the greenAnd there by dizens we lay down.Syne sweetly ca’d the healths a-roun’,To bonny lasses, black and brown,As we lao’d best;In bumpers we dull cares did drown,An’ took our rest.When in our pouch we found some clinksAn’ took a turn o’er Bruntsfield Links,Aften in Maggy’s, at Hay jinks,We guzzl’d crude.Till we cou’d scarce, wi’ hale-out drinks,Cast aff our duds.We drank, an’ drew an’ fill’d again,O wow ! but we were blyth an’ fain :When ony had their count mistane,O it wras nice,To hear us a’ cry, Pick your bane,An’ spell your dice.Fou close we us’d to drink an’ rant,Until we did baith glowr and gaunt,An’ pish, an’ spew, an’ yesk, an’ maunt.Right swash I trow,Then aff auld stories we did chant,Whan we were fu’.2SWhan we were wearied at the gouff.Then Maggy Simpson’s was our houff,i Now a’ our gamesters may sit'douff,a Wi’ hearts like lead.Death wi’ his run reach’d her a youff,An’ sae she’s dead.Maun we be forc’d thy skill to tine.For which we will right sair repine ?Or hast thou left to bairns o’ thineThe pauky knack,O’ brewing ale amaist like wine,That gat’d us crack ?! Sae brawly did a pease-scone tost,; Biz i’ the quaff, and flee the frost.There we gat fu’ wi’ little cost,An’ muckle speed:I Now wae worth death, our sport’s a’ lost.Since Maggy’s dead.. Ae summer night I was sae fu’,J Amang the riggs I gaed to spew,: Syne down on a green bank I trow,I took a nap,j An’ sought a’ night Balillilu,As sound’s a tap.An’ whan the dawn began to glow,I birsled up my dizzy pow,Frae ’mang the corn like worry cow,Wi’ banes fu’ sair,I An’ kend nae mair than if a yuw.How I came there.24Some said it was the pith of broom.That she stow’d in her masking loom,Which in our heads rais’d sic a soom,Or some wild seed,Which aft the chappen stoup did toom,But fill’d our head.But now since ’ris sae that we mustNot in the best ale put ©ur trust,Bnt when we’re auld return to dust,Without remeed;Why should we tak it in disgust.Since Maggy’s dead:O’ wardly comforts she was rife.An’ liv’d a lang an’ hearty life.Right free o’ care, or toil, or stife.Till she was stale ;An’ kend to be a canny wifeAt brewing ale.Then farewell Maggy, dowse an’ fell,O* brewers a’ you bore the bell;Let a’ your gossips yelp an’ yell,An’ without feed,Guess whither ye're in heaven or hell,They’re sure ye*re dead., ' ' ',.,1 ' llwFINIS

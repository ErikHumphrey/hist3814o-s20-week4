LHow King Henry VIII. used to visitthe Watches in the City, and howhe became acquainted with a mer¬ry jovial Cobler.It was the custom of King Henrythe eighth, to walk late in the nightinto the City disguised, to observeand taks notice how the constablesand watch performed their duty, notonly in guarding the city gates, but-also in diligently watching the in¬ward parts of the city, that so they3might, in a great measure preventthose disturbances and casuali&eswhi^h too otten happen in great andpopulous cities in the night, and thishe did often times, without the leastdiscovery who he was j returninghome to Whitehall early in the mor¬ning. „ / r: ...... r . : ’m m )Now in his return home throughj the Strand, he took notice of,a certaincobler, who was constantly up atwork, whistling and singing every•morning. The King was resolved tosee him and be acquainted with him,in order to which he immechaielyknocks the heel, off his shoe by hitingit against a stone ; and having sodone, he bounced at the cobler’s stall.. • » ■ j » 1 •Who’s their ? cries the * cpbler.i ■ ^ hfr: ■’-vvHere’s one, cries the King. Withthat the cobler opened the. stall door,and the King as'fed him if he couldset the heel on his shoe. .* ;4Yes, tliat I can, says tlie cobler,Conte in^ honest fellow, and sit theedown by me, and I will do it forthee straight; the cobler scraping hisawls and old shoes to one side, tomake room for the King to sit down,•*xC*21 Uiii ill ' J ' .. [The King being hardly able to for¬bear laughing at the kindness of theCobler, asked him if there was not ahouse hard by that sold a cup of ale,and the people up.Yes, said the cobler, there is an innever the way, where I belive thefolks are up. for the carriers go fromthence very early in the morning.With that the King borrowed anold shoe from the cobler, and wentover to the inn, desiring the Coblerwould bring his shoe to him thitheras toon as he had put on the heel a-gain. The cobler promised he would.So making what haste he could toput on the heel, he carries it over tothe King, saying, Honest blade, here»u 5is thy shoe, and I warrant thee it willnot come off again in haste.Very well, says the King, whatmust you have for your pains ?A couple of pence replied the cob-ler.Well, said the king seeing thou artan honest merry fellow, here is a teas-ter for thee—come sit down by me, Iwill drink a full pot with thee. Comehere’s a good health to the King.With all my heart, said the cobler,I’ll pledge thee were it in water.So the cobler sat down by the King,and was very merry, and drank offhis liquor very freely ; he likewisesung some of his merry songs andcatches, whereat the king laughedhearily, and was very jocund andpleasant with the cobler, telling himwithal that his name was Harry Tu¬dor, that he belonged to the court, &6that if he would come and see himthere, he would make him very wel¬come, because he was a merry com¬panion, and charged him not to for¬get his name and to ask any one forhim about the court, and they wouldsoon bring him to him ; for, said theking, I am very well known there.Now the cobler little dreamt thathe was the King that spake to him,much less that the King’s name wasHarry Tudor. Therefore, with agreat deal of confidence he stands up,puts off his hat, makes two or threescrapes with his foot, and gives theKing many thanks, also telling him,that he was one of the most honestfellows that ever he met with in allhis life-time, and although he hadnever been at court, yet he should notbe long before he would make a ho¬liday to come and see him.%Whereupon the King paying forwhat they had driink, would have ta¬ken his leave of the Cobler ; but he,not being willing to part with him,took hold of his hand and said, Bymy faith you must not go, you shallnot go, you shall first go and see mypoor habitation, I have there a tub ofgood brown ale that was never tap¬ped yet, you must go and taste it, for' you are. the most honest blade L evermet withal, and I love an honest mer¬ry companion vrith all my heartCHAP. II.How the Cobler entertained the kingin his cellar, and of the disturbancethey had like to have had by hiswife Joan.So the Cobler took the King withhim over the way where he had hiscellar adjoining the stall, which washandsomely and neatly furnished fora man of his profession. loco hiscellar he had the king. There sai.l he,sit down you’re welcome, but 1 mustdesire you to speak softly for tear ofwaking my wife Joan who lives uaiti8by (shewing the King a close bedirade up at a corner of the cellar,much like a closet) for if she shouldawake, she will make our ears ringagain.At which speech of the cobler’s, theking laughed, and told him he wouldbe mindful and follow his directions.Whereupon the cobler kindled upa fire, and fetched out a brown loaf,from which he cut a lusty toast,which he toasted at the fire ; then hebrought out his Cheshire cheese—Now, says he, there is as much fel¬lowship in earing as in drinking ;which made the king admire thehonest freedom of the cobler.So having eaten a bit, the coblerbegan a health, “To all truo heartsand merry companions.” At whichthe King smiled, raying, Friend, I’llpledge thee.In this manner they eat and drank0together till it was almost break ofday ; the cobler being very- free ofhis liquor, and delighting the Kingwith several of his old stories, inso¬much, that he was highly pleasedwith the manner ot his entertainmentwhen on a sudden, the cobler's wifebegan to wake, l fairii, says the cob¬ler, you oust oegone, my wife beginsto grumble, siie’li awake presency,and 1 would not for half the shoes inmy shop she would find you here.Then taking the king by the hand,he led him up atairs, saying, Fare-wel, honest friend, it shan’t be longbefore 1 make a holiday to come andsee thee at court.Thou shalt be kindly welcome, re¬plied the King.So they parted, the King on his wayto Whitehall, and the cobler to hisceliar, and there putting all things torights before his yvife Joan got up,he went to work,again, whistling it10& singing as merry as he used to d©being much satisfied that he happen¬ed on so good and jovial a compani¬on, still pleasing himself in histhoughts how merry he should bewhen he came to court.CHAP. nr.How the Cobler prepared himself togo to court, and how he was setout in the best manner by his wifeJoan.Now as soon as the King camehome, he sent out orders about thecourt,'that if any one enquired forhim by the name of Harry Tudor,they should immediately bring himbefore him, whatever he was, with¬out any further examination of him.\The cobler thought every day amonth till he had been at court to seehis new acquaintance, and was trou¬bled how he should get leave of hiswife Joan, for he could not get wit^11out her knowledge, by reason he didresolve to make himself as fine as hecould, for his wife always kept thekeys of his holiday cloaths, whereu¬pon one evening as they sat at sup.per, finding her in very good hum¬our, he began to lay open his mindto her, telling her the whole story oftheir acquaintance, repeating it overand over again, that he was the mosthonest fellow that ever he met with.Husband, quoth she, because youhave been so ingenious to tell me thewhole truth, I will give you leave tomake a holiday for this once youshall go to court, and I will make youas fine as I can.? So it was agreed that he should gothe court the next day ; whereuponJoan rose betimes the next morning,to brush up her husband’s holidaycl jthes, and made him as fine as sheCould. She washed and ironed thelace-band and made his shoes shinethat he might see his face in them ;having done this, she made her' hus-12hand rise and pull off his shirt. Thenshe washed him with warm waterfrom head to foot, putting on him aclean shirt; afterwards she dressedhim in his holiday clothes; pinninghis laced band in prim.CHAP. IV,The Cobler’s Reception at Court,with the Manner of his Behaviorbefore the King.THE cobler being thus set forth,strutted through the streets like acrow in a gutter, thinking himself asline as the best of them all.In this manner he came to court,walking up and down, and staring onevery body he met with, not know¬ing to whom to ask for Harry TudorAt last he espied one, as he thoughtin the habit of a servant, to w homhe made this address, saying.Dost thou hear, honest fellow, d©13you know one Harry Tudor whobelongs to the Court.Yes, said the man, follow me, and1 will bring you to him.With that he had him presently upinto the guard-chamber, telling oneof the yeomen of the guard there wasone that enquired for Harry Tudor.Replied the yeoman, I know himvery well—if you please to go alongwith me, I’ll bring you to him im¬mediately.So the cobler followed the yeoman,admiring very much the prodigiousfinery of the rooms which he carriedhim through. He thought wiininhimself thatthe yeomen wasmistakenin the person whom he enquired for;for, said he, he whom I look for is aplain merry, honest fellow, his nameis Harry Tudor ; we drank two potstogether not long since, I suppose1*fie may belong to some lord or otherabout the court.I tell you, friend, replied the yeo¬man, I know him very well, do youbut follow me and I shall bring youto him straight.So going forward he came into theroom where the King was, accompa¬nied by several ot the nobles attend¬ed him.As soon as the yoemen had put upby the orras, he spoke aloud. May itplease your Majesty here is one thatenquires tor riarry Tudor.The cobler hearing this, thoughthe had committed no less than trea¬son : Therefore he up with his heelsand ran for it; but not being ac¬quainted with the several turningsand rooms through which he came,he was soon overtaken, and broughtbefore the King j whom the coblerlittle thought to be the person he en«15quired after ; therefore in a tremblingcondition he fell down on his knees,saying,May it please your grace, may itplease your highness, I • am a poorcobler, and enquired for one HarryTudor, who is a very honest fellow,I mended the heel of his shoe not longsince for which he paid me nobly,and gave me two pots to boot, but,I had him afterwards to my sellar,where we drank part of p cup ofnappy ale, and were very merry,, tillmy wife Joan began to grumblewhich put an end to our merrimentfor that time, but I told him I wonldcome to the court and see him as soonas conveniently I could.f-A Well, said the King, don’t be trou¬bled, do you know this honest fel¬low again, if you could see him ?The cobler replied, Yes, that I dosamong a thousand.16Then said the King, Stand up andbe not afraid, but look well a .outyou, peradventure you may find thefellow in this company.Whereupon the cobler arose andlooked wishfully upon the King andthe rest of his nobles, hut it was tolittle or no purpose ; for though hesaw something in the King’s facewnich he thought he had seen before,yet he could not imagine him to beHarry Tudor whose shoe-heel heh..d mended, and who had been someny with him at the inn, and atIns own cellar.He therefore told the King he hadnot expected to find Harry Tudor a-mong such tine folks as he was there,but me person he looked for was aplain, merry, honest, an'* true heart¬ed fellow. Adding withal, that hewas sure that did Harry 1 udor butknow that he was come to court, hewould make him very Wrelcome ; fur,says the cobler, whan we parted, he17charged me to came to court soonand see him, which I promised Iwould, and accordingly I have madea holiday on purpose to have a glasswith him.At which speech of the cobler’s,the King had much ado to forebearlaughing out, but keeping his coun¬tenance as steady as he could beforethe cobler, he spoke to the yeomanof the guard.Here, said he, take this honestcobler down into my cellar, and lethim drink my good health—I willgive orders that Harry Tudor shallcome to him presently.So away they went, the coblerbeing fit to leap out of his skin forjoy, not onlv that he had come off sowell, but that he should see hisfriend Harry Tudor.18CHAP. V. .. .The Cobler’s entertainment in theKing’s Cellar,The cobler had not been long inthe King’s cellar, before the Kingcame to him in the same habit thathe had on when the cobler mendedhis shoe ; whereupon the coblerknew him immediately, and ran andkissed him, saying.Honest Harry I have made an ho¬liday on purpose to see you but I hadmuch ado to get leave of my wifeJoan, who was loath to lose so muchtime from my work, but I was resol¬ved to see you, and therefore I mademyself as fine as I could. But I’lltell thee, Harry, when I came to courtI w£s in a peck of troubles how tofind you out ; but at last I met witha man who told me he knew'you ve¬ry well, and that he would bring meto you ; but instead of doing so, he19brought me before the King whichalmost frightened me out of my sev¬en senses : but faith I’m resolved tobe merry with you now since I havemet you at last.Ay, that we shall, replied the king,we will be as merry as princes.Now after the cobler had drunk a-bout four or five good healths, he be¬gan to be merry, and fell a-singinghis old songs und catches, whichpleased the king very much, andmade him laugh heartily.When on a sudden, several of thenobles came into the cellar extraordi¬nary rich in apparel who all stood un¬covered before Harry Tudor, whichput the cobler into great amazementat first; but presently recovering him¬self, he looked more wishfully uponHarry Tudor, and soon knowinghim to be the King whom he saw inhe presence chamber, though in a*.20nother habit, he immeditaly fell u-pon his knees, saying,May it please your Grace, may itplease your Highness, I am a poorhonest cobler, and mean no harm.No, no, said the King, nor shallyou receive any here, I assure you,He then commanded him to rise,and be as merry as he was before ;and though he knew him to be theKing, yet he should use the samefreedom with him as he did whenhe mended the heel of his shoe-This kind speech of the King’s,and three or four glasses of wine,made him be in as good humour ashe was before, telling the King sev¬eral of his droll stories, ^nd singingsome of his best songs, very muchto the satisfaction of the King and■°11 his nobles.21THECOBLER’S SONGIN THEKING’S CELLAR.COME let us drink the other pot,our sorrows to confound ;Well laugh and sing before the Kingso leif his health go round.For I’m as bold as bold can be,no cobler e’er was ruder ;Then here good fellow here's to thee,rememb’ring Harry Tudor.f t * f1 .When I’m at work within my stall,upon him I will think ;His kindness I to mind will call,whene’er I eat or drink.22His kindness was to me so great,the like was never known,His kindness I shall still repeat.And so shall my wife Joan,I’ll laugh when I sit in my stall,and merrily will sing.That I with my poor last and awl,am fellow with the king.But it is more, I must confessthan I at first did know ;But Harry Tudor, ne’ertheless,resolves it shall be so.And now farewell unto WhitehallI homeward must retire,To sing and whistle in my stall,my Joan will me desire.1 do but think how she will laugh,when she hears of this thing.That he that drank her nut brown,was England’s royal king, (ale,23CHAP. VI.How the Cobler became a Courtier.Now the kicg considering the plea¬sant hun-our of the cobler, how inno¬cently merry he was, and free fromany designs ; that he was a personthat labored very hard, and took agreat deal of pains for a small liveli¬hood, was pleased out of his princely-grace and favor, to allow him a libe¬ral annuity of forty merks a year,for the better support of his jolly hu¬mour, and the maintainance of hiswife Joan ; and that he should be ad¬mitted one of his couruers, and thathe might have the freedom of hiscellar, whenever he pleased.24Which being so much beyond ex¬pectation, did highly exalt the cob-ler’s humour, much to the satisfac¬tion of the King.So after a great many legs andscrapes he returned home to his wifeJoan, with the joyful news of hisreception at court; which so wellpleased her, that she did not thinkmuch at the great pains she took indecking him for the journey.£injs.

fam’d Mynheer Von Clam,Whose feelings of pride were very much gall’d,Eecause vou must know that his head was bauld,Ri too la ro, Ac.So he went and call’d upon Barbour Bombig,And told him directly to make him a wig,For said he, I can’t get any lady to wedWith me till I get some hair on my head.Ri too la ro, &c.Then the barber began (not a moment to wait)And took the dimensions of Clam’s bauld pate ,And as it was Mynheer’s desire,The springs were made of a new patent wne,Ri too la ro, Ac.The wig was made and fitted well,Which made Von Clam look like a swell;But when it was fasten’d tight on with the spring-.Oh * he flew in the air just as if he’d got wings.Ri too la ro, Ac.The barber was struck with wonder quite,To see the wig go up such a height,QO• So frighten’d was he that he quite ran away,And never wTas seen till this very day.Ri too la ro, &c.iAs to Von Glam he continu’d to fly,'Till he could’nt be seen with the naked eye ;iBut with a telescope him you might seeA flying about just like a parch’d pea.Ri too la ro, Ac.lit was about two years or more.Since poor Von Clam so high did soar,{When in Holland was heard a most terrible sound,Aud something fell wop right slap on the ground.Ri too la ro, Ac.The people all ran together in crowdsTo see what had fall’n from the clouds ;And they all in amazement were staring around,'To see Von Clam sitting bang on the ground.Ri too la ro, &c.They put him to bed but ’twas near a weekBefore he recovered sufncicnt to speak ;And the first thing he said when he’d taken a swig,j Twas I ve been to the sun and he burnt oft my wig’.Ri too la ro, Acpays Von Clam, From this time, I vow and declare,1 never will wear a wTig of false hair ;And whene’er I marry, without any sham.My wife shall have me just as I am.Ri too la ro, Ac.4MEG 0’ THE MILL.0 ken ye what Meg- o’ the Mill has gotten.An’ ken yo what Meg o’ the Mill has gotten ?She has gotten a coof wi’ a claute o’ siller.And broken the heart o’ the barley Miller.The Miller was strappin, the Miller was ruddy;A heart like a lord, and a hue like a lady :The laird was a widdiefu’, bleerit knurl;She’s left the guid fellow and ta’en the churl.The Miller he hecht her a heart leal and loving ;The Laird did address her wi’ matter mair moving,A fine pacing horse wi’ a clear chained bridle,A whip by her side, and a bonnie side-saddle.O wae on the siller, it is sae prevailing;And wae on the love that is fixed on a mailen!A tocher’s nae word in a true lover’s parle.But, gie me my love, and a fig for the warl!the banting hog the daddie O’T.O wha my babie-clouts will buy ?Wha will tent me when I cry ?Wha will kiss me whare I lie?The rautin dog the daddie o t.—Wha will own he did the faut ?Wha will buy my groanin-maut ?Wha will tell me how to ca’t ?The rantin dog the daddie o’t —oWhen I mount the creepie chair,WTha will sit beside me there ?Gie me Rob, I seek nae mair,The rantin dog the daddie o’t.—Wha will crack to me my lane ?Wha will make me fidgin fain ?Wha will kiss me o’er again ?The rantin doy the daddie o’t.—GILDEROY.Gilderoy was a bonny ooy,Had roses till his shoon;His stockings were of silken soy,Wi’ garters hanging doun.It was, I ween, a comlie sightTo see so trim a boy :Ho was my joy and heart’s delight.My handsome Gilderoy.O sic twa charming een he had!Breath sweet as ony rose :He never ware a highland plaid.But costly silken clothes.He gain’d the love of ladies gay,Nane e’er to him was coy:Ah, wae is me, I mourn the davFor my dear Gilderoy.My Gilderoy and I were bomBaith in ae toun together:GWe scant were seven years befornWe gan to luve ilk ither:Our daddies and our mammies theyWere fill’d wi’ mickle joy.To think upon the bridal dayOf me and Gilderoy.For Gilderoy, that love of mine.Glide faith, I freely boughtA wedding sark of Holland fine,Wi’ dainty ruffles wrought:And he gied me a wedding ringWhich I received wi’ joy:Xae lad nor lassie e’er could singLike me and Gilderov.Wi’ mickle joy we spent our primeTill we were baith sixteen,And aft we past the langsome timeAmong the leaves sae green :Aft on the banks we’d sit us there.And sweetly kiss and toy ;While he wi’ garlands deck’d my hair.My handsome Gilderoy.Oh that he still had been contentWi’ me to lead his life!But, ah, his manfu’ heart was bentTo stir in feats of strife.And be in many a venturous deedHis courage bauld wad try;And now this gars my heart to bleedFor my dear Gilderoy.<And when of me his leave he took.The tears they wat mine ee:I gied him sic a parting look!“ My benison gang wi’ thee 1God speid thee weel, mine ain dear heart.For gane is a’ my joy ,My heart is rent, sith we maun part.My handsome Gilderoy.”The Queen of Scots possessed noughtThat my love let me want;For cow and ewe he to me brought.And e’en whan they were scant;All these did h onestly possesslie never did annoy,Who never fail'd to pay their cessTo my love Gilderoy,My Gildcroy, baith far and near.Was fear’d in every town ;And bauldly bear awa the gear.Of mony a lawland loun.For man to man durst meet him nane.He was sae brave a boy:At length wi’ numbers he was tsnc—My winsome Gildcroy.Waeworth the loons that made the lawsTo hang a man for gear;To reave of life for sic a causeAs stealing horse or marc!Had not their laws been made ?ae strictI ne’er had lost my joy ;sWi’ sorrow ne’er had wat my cheekFor my dear Gilderoy.Gif Gilderoy had done amissHe mought hae hanisht been ;—A.h, what sair cruelty is this,To hang sic handsome men!To hang the flower o’ Scottish land,Sae sweet and fair a hoy :—Nae lady had sae white a handAs thee, my Gilderoy.Of Gilderoy sac fear’d they were,Wi’ irons his limbs they strung ;To Edinborow led him there,And on a gallows hung.They hung him high aboon the rest.He was sae bauld a boy ;There died the youth whom I loe’d best.My handsome Gilderoy.Sune as he yielded up his breathI bare his corps away ;Wi’ tears, that trickled for his death,I wash’d his comelie clay ;And siker in a grave right deepI laid the dear lo’ed boy:And now for ever I maun weep.My winsome Gilderoy.FINIS.

The child being circumcis¬ed, and she purified, according to the oldJewish custom, she dressed herself in adisguise, put a veil on her face, and, tak.ing *dlh iter a kinswoman, went to the-magician's, and being introduced to him,she related her dream, her fears, and themarks upon her son, desiring the inter-pfetatioh of the dream, and the significa¬tion of the marks.The magician replied, I am no inter¬preter of dreams, neither do I justlyknow the signification of marks } and the5■whole of your story appears as strangeto me, as it can be amazing to you ; butif you can teii me when the child wasborn, I will calculate its nativity, andsee what it portends. He tben Calledfor pen, ink, and paper, and sium .- down,calculated its nativity ; and when li -* hadI finished it, he shook his he i t, a d hiscountenance waxed pale; which beingI. perceived by Judas’s mother, she. saidunto him, Do not deceive me, out tellme truth, hide nothing from me, whetherit be good or evil.—Then, said the Ma¬gician, to your sorrow, [ have seen therules ot the planet that-reigned predo*minant at your son's birth, that he wouldn prove a thief, and a murderer, and whatis worse, he will, for lucre, betray theLord of Lite; for which fact he will af¬terwards despair of mercy, Ly violentbauds on himself, and come to a-shame¬ful end.—These words pierced the mo¬ther’s heart, who, wringing, her hands,wished she had never been born, ratherthan to have been the mother of such an-6unhappy child ; and asked the magicianwhat she could do to prevent the bring¬ing of shame and disgrace on her family ?He told her he knew no way of preven¬tion, but by laying violent hands on it,which might be now easily done it its in¬fancy, and in a manner so as not to bediscovered.—To this she replied, That»he would not for ten thousand worlds©oramit such an act of violence on her»on : for if her husband hr.d the least sus-* *picion of it, he was so very fond of Judas,that he would never be reconciled to herany more; yet for the sake of her family,ahe would by some means or other pre¬vent it without destroying it; and thentold the magician, That if she had a smaUboat made like a shell, with a cover togo down close, that no water might getin, and a little vent to let in air at top,and room in it to lie soft and easy, shemight without danger send him downthe river Jordan, and so commit himwiiolly to the protection of Providence,which might conduct him to some dis-tant shore, into the hands of some tenderpersons, and thereby preserve hi§ life ^then if he afterwards commits those baseactions, the shame will fall on its ownhead, as no one will know from whomhe is descended. The magician highlycommended her for her invention, andsaid he would procure such a boat forher j and she promising him a good re¬ward for his assistance, returned home., After she was gone, the magioian senti for one Rot, a very cunning artist, al joiner by trade, who undertook to makei the boat, drawing out ■with his pencil, theIform of it, carried it home with him,wrought upon it in private, and havings soon finished it, brought it to the magi-cian’s house, who paid him largely for it,is and sent a servant to the house of Simon,? who told Judas’s motheiy That the mat-Iter which his master and she spoke ofwas now finished. She understandinghim, yrent the next morning to the ma¬gician’s house, viewed the boat, and iikedit well, saying it was very convenient for8the end intended; but seemed perplexedhow she should do it privately, and keepit from a discovery, as death was the con-■ sequence thereof Her kinswroman beg¬ged her to leave that to her, and allshould be safe enough ; for we-will feignthe child sick for a day or two, in themeantime we will make an inquiry in thecity for the dead body of some poor malechild, which we will buy of'its parents,and have it privately brought to our hous6to be buried; in. the meantime wTe willdispatch your son to sea, and make himbelieve the o, her child to be his, and thathe died during his absence ; so having itburied, the matter can never be broughtto light.The mother liked the contrivance, andgoing home with a premise ofa great re¬ward, and her friendship for life, sheswore her servant to secrecy, and then,says she, we must act in this manner.When your master comes home at night,I shall put on very dejected looks, andwhen he asks the cause, I shall tell him.9that Judas is not *veU, and that I ana ap¬prehensive of his death, which you mustall testify and confirm. Sne accordinglyput this scheme into pr,ic ice at night,when her husband did ail he could tocomfort her, telling her that as they wereyoung, they might be parents of manychildren ; and going up stairs to see thechild, the maid then pinched its neck tillit was black in the face, and thinking itin convulsions, gave it over to death,j As soon as he was gone out in the morn¬ing, the mother and kinswoman took thschild, and went to the magician’s house,in order to put the child to sea. Theyput on him many warm and rich gar-i mentti, with an upper coat of oil, that no' vvater might penetrate it ; and the magKI cian, on a piece of parchment, wrote lhai following words:My Name is JUDAS., , %r which his mother sewed round his neck,: and put him into the boat, and shut10down the coven At parting with thechild the mother was almost distracted,wringing her hands and weeping bitterly;but being comforted by the magician andher kinswoman, she was at last pacified,and desired to go home, as she could notbear to see the child put into the water;so she and her kinswoman departedhome. The magician then took the boat,and carried it down to his own garden, iat the foot of which ran the river Jordan,and putting it in where a strong streamran, it was soon carried out of sight.The mother when she got home faint¬ed away, but vas revived by being in¬formed by her maid-servant, that duringher absence JLhey had almost brought thematter to a close, having found a neigh¬bour’s male cmid, who had died the daybefore, and vvas just of the same age as IJudas, for wh^se body they had given ithe parents a small sum of money, andpaid the expenses of burying a coffin fullof bones, by way of a blind ; and the11only thing that remained was to deceiveher husband, and get this child buriedunder the sanction of Judas’s body*The father coming home at night, andfinding his wife in tears, soon guessed atthe dismal cause j and inquiring of theservants, they with dissembled grief in¬formed him, That the child^died in themorning, soon after his departure. Theman was much affected with the loss ofhis child, and thinking to prevent hiswife’s grief by the sight of the body, hehad it removed to a kinsman’s house,and in a day or two interred it fromthence, supposing it to be his son Judas.By this time Providence had conduct,ed Judas, alive and well, upon the coastof Iscariot, a kingdom in Palestine,where Pheophilus the King often usedto recreate himself, in beholding theships pass and repass at sea. It hap¬pened that the very day that Judas wascast on the coast, the King and his no¬bles came on that diversion j and as theywere standing on the top of the rock.12wlooking into the sea, the King espied alittle boat floating upon the water, andthinking it to be a chest of some wreck¬ed ship, be ordered a servant to put outa boat and fetch it; which being done,and brought to the King, he ordered itto be broke open; when to their greatsurprise, they found a lovely babe, wholooked up, and smiled in the King'sface : Then said the King to the child,WELCOME AS MY OWN CHILD;and expressed much joy in being provi-dentially sent to preserve the babe’s life,and taking it up in her arms, said. Ifthou wert a child begat by me, I ceuidnot esteem or value thee more. Thenhe espied about its neck the aforemen¬tioned parchment, viz.My Name-is JUDAS.Well, said the King, is thy name is Ju-•das, I will now double name thee, and<then called him Judas Iscariot, becausehe found him near the coast of thatname. He was then brought to court.s13treated as the king's own child, and at aproper age educated well, and at last be.came a man of learning and parts, andbehaved himself so wisely, that the kingmade hicri his principal steward.Judas being arrived at this rank, stillcoveted greater, and remembering thequeen one day said, That if the princeher son died, Judas should be her heir,he therefore set about contriving to killhim, accordingly professed great love andfriendship for him ; and one day beingwalking together, Judas took occasionto quarrel with the prince, and malicious¬ly slew him, thinking all would go wellwith-him if he #as dead.Behold the Serpent, which the kingLong nourished in his breast,Grown warm, strikes forth his banefulsting,And robb’d him of his rest.14Though none accused him of the mur¬der, yet his own conscience so stung him,that he soon quitted the kingdom, leav¬ing all his pomp and finery behind him,and changing his name, took upon himthe mean employ of a servant, wander¬ing about from place to place, until atlength he arrived at Joppa, the place ofhis nativity j here he soon got a place ina nobleman’s family, where he behavedso well, as to gain the esteem of his Lordand Lady, and all that knew him. Oneday it happened, that as his Lady waswalking abroad big with child, she long¬ed for some fruit, which she saw in Ju¬das's father’s garden, bidding him go andbuy her some. He took the money, butwas resolved to steal the fruit; and go¬ing to the garden, broke down the fences,which as he was .doing, his father cameout, and seized him for the robbery j andJudas, to extricate himself from the handof justice, murdered his father upon thespot, and immediately escaped to The-ba, a city about seventy-six leagues dis-15tance* Here he continued four yeafaiin which time the noise of the murderbeing blown over, he returned backagain, ?nd got another place in a Noble¬man’s family, where he lived sometime,till his own mother accidentally seeinghim fell in love with, and married him.About five years after they had beenmarried, one morning in bed Judas’s shirtbosom lay open, when she saw, under hisleft breast, the marks he was born with;upon which »he waked him in an agony,and told him the whole story of his birth,and the part she had acted therein. Ju¬das heard this with wonder and astonish¬ment, and on his part confessed to herthe many crimes he had been guilty of;after which she desired him to departfrom her, and seek mercy 6f God in an¬other country ; protesting she would ne¬ver be carnally known to him any more.Judas, full of grief and remorse of con¬science, left Joppa, and wandered aboutlike a pilgrim, till he heard of a mightyprophet, called JESUS of NAZARETH,16in the land of Judea, who wrought manymiracles, and wonderful works; to himhe went, and liking his doctrine, andseeing his miracles, he begged of ourLord to be admitted one of his followers :making him one oi his disciples, and alsohis treasurer. Notwithstanding all this,Judas could not forget his covetousness ;for when Mary Magdalen brought a boxof costly ointment, to anoint our dearLord’s feet, at the house of Simon theLeper, Judas was offended thereat, be¬cause the value thereof was not put intohis bag, But our Lord knowing h-is co¬vetous and wicked heart, sharply rebuk¬ed him ; at which he was so enraged,that he in revenge premeditated, and putinto execution, the worst action cf allhis life, and going to the chief priestsand elders, he 'said unto them, What willyou give me, and I will betray him theycall Jesus in your hands? And theyagreed with him for thirty pieces ofsilver.17The l<JVe of money is a rockWhich causes care and trouble,And he that hasteth to be rich,He makes his sorrows double.Money’s a most alluring bait, .- Conducive unto evil,For this base Judas sold his God,Himself unto the devil.When our Tord was instituting his lastsupper, he said unto bis disciples, I havechosen you twelve, but one of you is adevil.—And again, Verily 1 say unto ye,one of ye this night shall betray me, andhe it is unto whomsoever I shall give asop j then giving a sop unto Judas, hesaid unto him, What thou dost do quick¬ly-—With this sop the devil entered intoJudas, and he went out from amongstthem.—Judas then went to the chiefpriests, and received the thirty pieces ofsilver; so taking with him an armedband, telling them, that whomsoever heshould kiss the sajne was he, hold him18fast, came back to where Jesus was, andmeeting him in the Garden of Gethse-mane, he went up to him, saying. Hail,Master, and kissed him. Then they laidhands on the Lord, and bound him as athief and a murderer, and led him awayto the high Priests and Elders, who askedhim many questions j to which our Lordgave them no answer, but stood like alamb dumb before his shearers. Never¬theless, the whole assembly, though theyfound nothing worthy of death in him,,one by one passed the following senten-ces on him:19JERUSALEM'S BLACK TRIBUNAL;.

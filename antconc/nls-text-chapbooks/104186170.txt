THE(D U> IE IB 4m' t** <, \.RECITER,A SELECTIONOF THEMOST POPULAR PIECESFORRECITATION,PRINCIPALLY FROMSIR WALTER SCOTT, CAMPBELL,LORD BYRON, HOGG, WOLFE,AND OTHER POETS OF►THE DAY.THE RECITER.On the Manner of Reading Verse.“ Whatever difficulties we may find in readingprose, they are greatly increased when the com¬position is in verse: and more particularly if theverse be rhyme. The regularity of the feet, andthe sameness of sound in rhyming verse, stronglysolicits the voice to a sameness of tore; and tone,unless directed by a judicious ear, is apt to de*lgenerate into a song, and a song, of all others,the most disgusting to a person of just taste.—If, therefore, there are few who read prose withpropriety, there are still fewer who succeed inverse. For those, therefore, whose ears are notjust, and who are totally deficient in a true tastefor the music of poetry, the best method of avoid¬ing this impropriety is to read verse exactly as ifit vcere prose; for though this may be said to bean error, it is certainly an error on the safer side.“ To say, however, as some do, that the pro¬nunciation of verse is entirely destitute of song,and that it is no more than a just pronunciationof prose, is far distant from truth. Poetry with¬out song is a body without a soul. The tune ofthis song is, indeed, difficult to hit; but whenonce it is hit, it is sure to give the most exquisitespleasure. It excites in the hearer the most eagerdesire of imitation; and if this desire be not ac¬companied by a just taste of good instruction, itfgenerally substitutes the turn ti, turn ti, as it iscalled, for simple, elegant, poetic harmony.* ** * *“ It must, however, be confessed, that elegantreaders of verse often verge so nearly on what i«called sing song, without falling into it, that it isno wonder those who attempt to imitate them,'slide into that blemish which borders so nearlyon a beauty.” Walker'.Glenara.Oh ! heard ye yon pibroch sound sad in the gale,Where a band cometh slowly with weeping andwail ?’Fis the Chief of Glenara laments for his dear;And her sire and her people are called to herbier.Glenara came first with the mourners and shroud;Her kinsmen they follow’d, but mourned notaloud;Their plaids all their bosoms were folded around ;They march’d all in silence—they look’d to theground.In silence they reach’d over mountain and moor,To a heath, where the oak-tree grew lonely andhoar,* Now here let us place the gray-stone of hercairn—Why speak ye no word V said Glenara the stern.« And tell me, I charge you, ye clan of my spouse.Why fold ye your taantles, why cloud ye yourbrows VSo spake the rude chieftain: no answer is made,But each mantle unfolding, a dagger display’d.441 dream’d of my lady, I dream’d of her shroud,’ 1Cried a voice from the kinsmen, all wrathful andloud;‘ And empty that shroud, and that coffin did .seem:Glenara ! Glenara ! now read me my dream !’Oh ! pale grew the cheek of that chieftain I ween;When the shroud was unclosed, and no body wasseen ; 1.Then a voice from the kinsmen spoke louder in ;scorn—’Twas the youth that had loved the fair Ellen ofLorn.‘ I dream’d of my lady, I dream’d of her grief,I cream’d that her lord was a barbarous chief;On a rock of the ocean fair Ellen did seem:Glenara !

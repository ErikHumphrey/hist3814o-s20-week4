Thefe things were foretold bythe two Scots Prophets in the reign of KingArthur; frit by the Marvellous Merling, whois laid to be got by a devil, who ravifhed ayoung woman his mother in a wood near Cold*firearn, in the fouth of Scotland, afterwardsto the fame purpofe, thefe and many moreOrange things W’ere foretold by Thomas Ler?moot, vulgarly called Thomas Ryiner, becaufehe fpoke all his prophetical fayings in rhyme.and fo darkly that they could not be under*Hood until they came to pafs.Ihis Thomas Lermont or Rymer was bomat Erflington, now called Hefelingtown onTweedfide, above Kelfo. He is reported byhiftorians to be a quiet fober man given to nsmanner of vice but prone to piety and devo¬tion, a famous monthly prognodicator, con¬cerning the date of the weather and govern¬ment of the world, by ft tidying the afpe£ts ofthe planets. He being one day afked by anobleman what fort of a day they fhould haveto-morrow ? To which he anfwered, That themorrow before high noon, a blaft fhould blaw,that Scotland fhould not overcome the evilthereof for twenty years thereafter. The noble¬man and many more being greatly amazed,and giving great attention, looking for the blaftall the next day till towards evening, he fentfor Thomas to rebuke him for the fallhood ofhis Prophecy, and juft as he began to upbraidhim, he heard the found of a poll’s horn, whocame with the woeful news, how the king hadbeen hunting, and had broke his neck over acraig the weft fide of the town of Kinghorn,from which accident the town derived its name.Now, fays Thomas to the Nobleman, the blaft:is blawn, and for twenty years after there wasno peace, but bloody wars in Scotland, on theaccount of who fhould be king. Now as to thereft of his prophetical fayings, they are hardto be underftood, becaufe they are pointedout by the coats of Arms, which apertain tofo many different kingdoms, and perfons. Yetwe obferve how he has pointed out plainly., CJ )many things which has come to pafs in ourdays; fach as the extirpation of the noble raceof the Stewarts, the revolution, Sheriff-moor,&c. where he fays.That three Ships and a Shield,That day (hall keep the Field $And be the Antelope's bcild.Thefe three fliips and a fheild, are in theI Duke of Argyle’s arms; and even every par-II ticular of the rebellion in 1745 and 46, whenj, pointing at, he fays, a chieftain unchofcn (hallchoofe forth himfelf and rule the realm as hisi own, when as King Charles, he calls him a flyfox bird, who would turn to Chrift with toadsor foxes wyles, meaning his fwearing the co¬venants. When fpeaking of the battle of Pref-j ton-pans in the year 1745, he names the very! two neighbouring villages to the fpot of groundwhereon it was fought, to wit, Goyfe-fordgreen and Seton, faying. Between Seton andthe fea, forrow (hould be wrought by thelight of the moon, which aft really came topafs that morning the battle of preflon-pansj was fought; but how the Lion was hurt atthis time and not perceived, is yet a myftery.Some are of opinion, that it is by taking away|| the power or fuperiority from the chiefs of theI Highland Clans, fo that they cannot raife menl! in fuch a (hort time as formerly.1 hefe are a few of the obfervations we makeon things already come to pafs, and as whatis yet to come there is fome remarks will yethappen when the time draws nigh j fuch aswhen Tar bet’s Graigs are tumbled into the Sea.and the nextfeafon or fummer thereafter, g' eatfarrow and bloodflted fhall happen to this re¬alm, the chief thereof, efpeciaily fuch as had¬ing on fleds and chopping off heads. Thie Tar-bet Hands near the fmmth of the river Clyde,but whether ks being tumbled in the fea, (hallhappen by an earthquake, thunder, or by thehands of men, is a my fiery unknown. Thereis alfo mention made of a Lord with a luckenor double hand, which certainly is of royal |blood, and will bread great ftir aud confufion ||in Britain. This man is alive in this very pre-fent age, and of the Stuarts race, now in l- rtidy..: And there is plainly pointed out that inhis time, a great battle ihould be feen in Fife.Where fadtdled horfes (hould be feen,Tyed unto the trees green.Not only in Fife, but the four chief riversof the realm, there fhould be a battle on eachof them, that ftiould make the rivers run withblood, to wit, Tweed, Clyde, Forth and Tay,and laft of all, a bloody defperate battle in* Northumberland, on the river Tyne, alfo greathavock and flaughter about the broad wall* ofBerwick all thefe things are yet to cbdie topafs, and when the firli appears, the re If willfoon follow after.f r n i aT /

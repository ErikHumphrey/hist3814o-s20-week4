and from them, with the utmost infal¬lible certainty, can be told every circumstance thatwill happen to any one, by observing them pro¬perly. It is therefore recommended to pay a strictattention to this object, as by that means you willundoubtedly gain very excellent knowledge foryour pains.And first is given the name of the several lines,as they hold their places, and then particularizetheir qualities.It)There are five principal lines in the hand, viz.The Line of Life, or Life Line as it is herecalled.The Line of Death.The Table Line.The Girdle of Venus.The Line of Fortune.And besides these there are other Lines, as theLine of Saturn ' the Lever Line and some others,but these only serve to explain the principal Lines.The chief Lines on which persons of the profes¬sion lay the greatest stress, is the Line of Life, orthe Life Line, as it is here called, which generallytakes its rise where the thumb joint plays with thewrist on the inside, and inns in an oblique direc¬tion to the inside of the innermost joint of the forefinger.The next is the Line of Death which separatesthe fleshy part of the hand on the little finger side,from the hollow of the hand, running in various-directions in different people.The Table Line originates with the Life Line,at the wrist, and runs through the hollow of thehand towards the middle finger.The Girdle of Venus, takes its course from theextremity of the innermost joint of the little fingerand forming a curve, terminates between the foreand middle fingersThe Line of Fortune strikes from behind fileball or mount of the fore finger, across the palmand Line of Life, and loses itself in or near thefleshy part of the hand on the little finger side.If the Line of Life is crossed by other Lines ator near the wrist, the person will meet with sicknessin the beginning of life, and the degree of sicknesswill be proportioned to the size, length and breadthof the intervening lines. If the Life Lino runsfair and uninterrupted, the person will enjoy goodhealth; and according toils length towards the11outside of the lore finger, you may judge if theperson will live long, as the longer the Lino thelonger the Life.]f the Line of Death is short, and runs even,without being broken or divided, it shows that theperson will enjoy a good length of days, and not besubject to many maladies; hut if it is interrupted,it evidently shows that the person’s life will be en¬dangered by illness, but by the care of providencewill recover.When the table Line is broad, strong, and wellmarked, it shows the person to bo of a sound con¬stitution, and peaceable contented mind ; if it isbroken, it shows for every break a violent interrup¬tion to happiness ; if these breaks happen towardsthe part next the w’rist, he will be crossed in loveand either be disappointed in the person he hasfixed his affections on, or be saddled with a personof a disobliging temper, and a most audaciousand abusive tongue.The girdle of Venus, wiien it goes on fair andwell marked, shows that the person will be pros¬perous in love, fair in his dealings with the fair sexand be sincerely beloved ; he will obtain a partnerfor life of a fortune equal to his own, sweet tem¬pered, faithful, and affectionate ; but if it is inter¬rupted at its beginning near the little finger, howill meet with early disappointments in love; iftowards the middle of the line, he will ruin bishealth,and injure his fortune with lewd prostitutes;if near the end, he will be foolishly amorous in hisold age, still expecting to gain the heart of a wo¬man, but never obtain it.The Line of Fortune by its approach to theGirdle of Venus, shows that there isasUong kin¬dred between them, and their distance at their twoextremities clearly point out that love is inconsistentwith childhood and old age ; yet in those wherethe cross lines approach from the one to the other12near the ends, prove that the person was or willbe susceptible of love in childhood, or old a^e.If theliollow palm of the hand, which some callthe plain of Mars is full of cross lines running intoeach other, theperson will be of ahumoursome, un¬even and testy temper, jealous and hasty, quarrel¬some and fighting, and endeavouring to set othersby the ears ; he will meet with very frequent mis¬fortunes, and bear them very uneasily ; whereas, ifthe hollow or palm of the hand has none but theunavoidable lines; that is to say, those that mustunavoidably pass through it, he will be of a sweetand amiable disposition, full of sensibility, gratitudeand love, faithful, benevolent and kind,and thoughsubject to losses, crosses, and disappointments, willbear them with an even and agreeable temper ;from this party chiefly, it is recommended to per¬sons to choose their companions for life, either forfriendship or marriage.The mount or ball of the thumb, bears a parti¬cular analogy to the event of a person’s life withrespect tadisputes, quarrels, and law-suits ; if thismount has many long strait lines reaching fromthe thumb to the Line of life, they show that theperson will have several personal encounters; eitherwith hands, clubs,pistols, or swords, but if the linesare curved and crooked, they will indicate law¬suits, and according to the degree of crookedness,they will be long or short ; but if these lines endin a straight direction towards the line of life, theywill end prosperously, whether encounter or law¬suits, if otherwise, they will be attended with anunfavourable issue; the nearer to the line of lifethese lines begin, the later in a person’s life thequarrels or law-suits will take place; and thenearer to the line of life they end, the later in filethey will terminate.13TO TELfi FORTUNES BY THEGROUNDS OF A COFFEE CUP.Directions to poor out the Coflee Grounds.Pour the groundsot'coffee in a white cup, shakethem well about in it, so that their particles mayj cover the surface of the whole cup ; then reversei into the saucer, that superfluous parts may be1 drained, and thefiguresrequired for fortune-tellingbe formed.

On thetop, or in the middle of the cup, it promises to theconsulting party the triumph which he desiresover his enemy ; but he will not attain it so easilyif the serpent be in the thick or cloudy part. Bythe letter which frequently appears near the em¬blem, the enemy may easily be guessed, it makesthe initial of his name.The Tetter..By letters we communicate to our friends eitherpleasant or unpleasant news, and such is the casehere ; if this emblem is in the clear parts it denotesthe speedy arrival of welcome news; surroundedwith dots, it announces the arrival of aconsiderableremittance of money ; but hemmed in by cloudsit is quite the contrary, and forebodes some mel¬ancholy or bad tidings of a loss, or some other sin¬ister accident.The Coffin,The emblem of death, prognosticates the samething here, or at least a long and tedious illness,if it be in the thick or turbid. In the clear it de¬notes Ions; life. In the thick, at the top of the cup15it signifies a considerable estate left to the party bysome rich relation; in the same manner at thebottom, it shows that the deceased is not so nearlyrelated to the consulting party.The StarDenotes happiness if in the clear, and at the topof the cup ; clouded, or in the thick, it signifieslong life, though exposed to various vicissitudesand troubles. If dots are above it, it foretells jtoodfortune, wealth, high respectability, &c. Severalstars denotes so many good and happy children ;tut surrounded with dashes, shows that childrenA’ill cause you grief and vexation in your old age,Mind that you ought to prevent it by giving them adigood education in time.The DogMpeing at all times the emblem of fidelity or envy,-has also a two-fold meaning here. At the top, inIhe clear, it signifies true and faithful friends; butflf his image be surrounded with clouds and dashes,'it shows that those whom you take for yourlends are not to be depended on ; but if the doge at the bottom of the cup, you have to dreadhe effects of extreme envy or jealousy.The Lilt/.If this emblem be at the top, or in tne middle ofre cup, it signifies that the consulting party eitheras or will have a virtuous spouse; if it bo at the1 ottom, it denotes quite the reverse. In the clearre lily further betokens long and happy life; ifi loaded, or in the thick, it portends trouble anda, exation, especially on the part of one’s relation.The Crons.ij>e it one or more, it generally predicts adversities,ms position varies, and so the circumstances. IfEl be in the top, and in the clear, shows that thefjjiisfortunes of the party will soon be at an end, orfiat he will easily get over them; but if it appear,(I the middle, or at the bottom in the thick, the16party must cxpoct many severe trials; if it appearwith Jots, either in the clear or in the thick, itpromises a speedy change of one’s sorrow.T/ie Clouds.If they be more light than dark, you may ex¬pect a good result from your hopes; but if they areblack, you may give it up. Surrounded with dotsthey imply success in trade, and in all your under¬takings ; but the brighter they are, the greaterwill be your happiness.The Sun.The emblem of the greatest luck and happiness,if in the clear; but in the thick it bodes a greatdeal of sadness; surrounded by dots or dashes, de¬notes that an alteration will easily take place.The Moon.If it appears in the clear, it denotes high honours,in the dark, or thick part, it implies sadness, whichwill, however, pass without great prejudice. Butif it be at the bottom of the cup, the consultingparty will be fortunate both by water and land.Mountain.If it represents only one mountain, it indicatesthe favour of people of high rank, but several ofthem, especially in the thick, are signs of powerfulenemies; in the clear they signify the contrary,,or friends in high life, who are endeavouring topromote the consulting party.The Tree.One tree only, be it in the clear or thick part,,points out lasting health ; several trees denotes that;your wish will be accomplished.The Child.In the clear part it bespeaks innocent intercourse!between the consultor and another person ; in thethick part, excesses in love matters, attended withgreat expences; at the bottom of the cup, it de¬notes the consequence of lubidinous amours, andra very destructive end.17'he true method of Telling your Fortune byCARDS.TAKE a pack of Cards, and pick six out ofih soil, viz., the 8, i), 10, Knave, Kin”;, andicon, these being the most prophetic cards in thek.

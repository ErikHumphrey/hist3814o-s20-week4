I come now to the third thing namely,To ihew you what it to be inferred from Chrift $making, interceffion for us.i/>, Thi* ii to be inferred from hence. Thatfaint* (for I will here fav nothing of thole ofthe elect uncalled) do oft-time* give cccafionof offmee to God, even they that have receivedgrace: For intcrcc ffi >n it made to continue orein the favour of another, and to make up tholebreaches that any time (hail happen tc. be madeby one, to the alienating of the aff ilioru ofthe other. And thus he make* reconciliationfor iniquity. Fom conciliation may be madeFor iniquity two way*: Firft, By paying ofa prices Secondly By infilling upon the pricepaid for the offender, by way of interc<ffi.jn.Therefore you read that a* a goat wa* to bekilled, fo hi* blood wa* by the prieft to b*brought within the veil, and in a way of in*terceffijn to be foririkled before and upon themercy feat: “ Then Ihall he kill the goat of !the liu-cfferitig that i» for the people and bring th;* bipod within the veil; and co with that |blood, a* he did" with the Wood of the bullock,and fpriqkic it upon the me:cy-feat and before *the mercy-feat: and he Ihnil make an atone- •merit f r the holy place, becaule of the un-cleanneffe* of the children ot Ifrael. and be-c^ui'd of their tranig'tlE -h* in aii .heir fir.*.,Ani 15)1V'( ” )And fo {frail he do for the tabernacle of theor-ngrega..ion that rcmaineih aTJ'>ng them, inthe midd of aU their uncleanneflei.” 1 hi*» a; to be done as you fee that the abernacle,which wa* the place of God * prtfer.ce andgrace*, might yet remain amorg the childrenof Itrael, not vithftanding their urx'eanr.efle*and traufgrtfS ns. ThU alio i* the efftft ofChrilV* iaterctffi.n ■, it i», that the hgn* ofGod t pretence and hi* grace nrt’ght remainamong his people, notwithdanding they haveby their traafgreffions fo often provoked Godto depart from them.“idly. By Chrift’* internGion I gather, that,aAakened men and women. Inch as the godlyare, dare not, at er offence given come in theiri<own names to make unto Ged an applicationt.jfor mercy.

Com®r», honest fellow, and sit thee down byme, and I will do it for thee straight \the cobler scraping his awls and oUshoes to one side, to make room for t. eking to sit down by him.The king being hardly able to forbearlaughing at the kindness of the cobler,asked him if there was not a house hard"hy that sold a cup of ate, and thepeople up, . •lies, said the Cvbler, there is an innover the way, where 1 believe the folksare up, for the carriers go from thencevery early in the morning.r . <>H that ttp king borrowed a»^ oldShoe of Uie eubK i md wort over to the, inn,-desiring t<uj oobier would bring bissho'a to him tfiiiht i as soon as he had:*• j»ut,the heel on < .uu, i ire cabjer pro*raised he would j so m King w'hat hastehe could to pm on thr- heel, he carriesit over to the king, sa iug, Honeat blade,here is thy shoe again ; and l -warrantthee it will not come off again in haste.Very well, says the King, what mustyou h ive for your pains..A couple of pence, replied the cobler.Well, said the King, seeing thou art anhonest merry fellow, here is a teaster fotthee; come sic down by me, I will drmka full pot with thee. Come, Iiere’s a goodhealth to the King.With all my heart, said the cobler.I’ll pledge thee were it in water..So the cobler sat down by the King,and was very merry, and drank off hisliquor very freely ; he likewise sungsome of his merry songs and catches,whereat ihe King laughed hcarHl), andwas very jocund ami pleasant with, thecobler, telling him withal that his namewas Harry Tudor, that he belonged tothe court, and that if he would comeand see hira there, he would m ke himvery welcome because Ho wzl. 4 roenycompanion, and charged, Uim not io tor-get his name, and to aah any one foriiitn about the court, and they ydfdd.soot! bring him to him ; for, said tkeKing, I arn very well known there.Now the cobler little dreamt thatwas the king that spake to him, muchless that .the king’s name was iJartyTudor. Therefore, with a great deal,of confidence, he stands up and puts offhis hat, makes two or three scrapes withhis foot, and gives the king manythanks, also telling him, that he was oneof the most honest fellows he ever metwith in all his lifetime, and althoughhe had never been at Court, yet heshould not be long before ife would makea holiday to come and see himWhereupon the king paying for whatthey had drunk, would have taken hisleave of the cobler; who, not beingwilling to part with him, took hold ofhis hand, and said, By my faith youmust not go, you shall first go and seemy poor habitation, I have there a tubof good brown ale that was never* toppedyet, and you must go and taste k, for-yoa are the most honest blade 1 ever metwithal, and 1 love an honest merry com?paniou with all my heart./ tHou' the Cabler entertained the King in hisCellar, and of the disturbance they hadhke to have had by his wife Joan.the cobler took the* King w ith himover the war, where he had hiscellar adjoining to the stall, which washandsomely and neatly furnished for aman of his profession. Into his cellar hehad the king ; there, said he, sit down,you are welcome, but 1 must desire youto speaf; softly, for fear of waking coy9i wife Joan, who lies hard tv.’ ; 'shewingthj king of a close bed made nearly upat one corner of the cellar, much like acloset, for if she should awake she willill make pur ears, ring'again!, ..At which speech of the cobler's theI king laughed, and told him, he would■ be mindful and follow his directions.I Whereupon the cobler kindled up uitire, and fetched out a brown loaf, fromI which he cut a lusty toast, which he settbaking at the fire ; then he brought outibis Cheshire, cheese. Come, said he,[will you eat some of my Cheshire cheese ;chore’s as good fellowship in eating asthere is in drinking.Which made the king admjre theripoest freedom of the cobier. So havingoaten a bit, the cobler began a health' ^ ' .10To ail true hearts ami merry compe.n*ions ; at which the king smiled, saying,Friend, I’li pledge thee.In this manner they ate and drank to¬gether, kill it' was almost break of day ) ;the cohler being very free of his liquor, |and delighting the king with several othis old stories, insomuch that he was-highly pleased with the manner of bis ;entej tahimeu; ; when on a sudden the- icoble;’s v. :fe Joan began to.awake. Infaith, says the cobier, you must be gone,ray wife Joan begins to grumble, she’d Iawake presently, and . I would not forhslt tne shoes in ray shop she would find Jyou here,Then taking the king by the hand,led him lip the s/airs, saying, Farewell,'honest friend, it shan’t be long before 1make a holiday to come and see thee atcourt.Thou shalt be kindly welcome, repliedthe king.So they parted, the king on Ins wayto Whitehall, ann the cobler to his cel-’,Tar, and there putting all things to hghtfbefore his wife Joan got up, he wentto work again, whistling and singing as-merry as;he used to do, being much s»-tbficd that he happened on so good and1jovial a companion, still pleasing nfi»- -self in bis thoughts how merry he shouldbe when came to court.Hoiv the Cohler pepared hmselj to go to| Court, and how he was set out in the bestmanner by 'his wife Joan.^OW as soon as the King came homesent out orders about the court,that if any one enquired for him by thenam6 of Harry Tudor they should im-Ktedjgtefy bring the person before him,whateV(ff *ie was» without any furthertxai*aination of 1 im.(121 The cobler thought every day a monthtill he had been at court to see his newacquaintance, and was trQulwd how heshould get leave of his wife Joan, for •he could not get without her knowledge, ^by reason he did resolve, to make him¬self as fine as he could, for his wife al¬ways kept the keys of his holiday clothes,whereupon one evening as they sat at |supper, finding her in a very good hu- Imour, he began to by open his mind toher, telling her the whole story ot theiracquaintance, repeating it over and overagain, that fie was the most honest fel¬low that ever be met witha 1 • Husband,quoth she, because you have been so in-- genuous to tell me i.he whole truth, 1 v. idgive you leave to make a holiday ic; tins.once ; you shall go to court, and 1 willetake you as fine as 1 can.So it was agreed that he should go tocourt the next day i whereupon Joanrose betimes the next morning to hiush |up her husband's holiday clothes, andmade him as fine as she could.

AtIi14last he espied one as he thought in thehabit of a servant man to whom he mattehis address, saying.Dost thou hear, honest fellow, do youknow one Harry Tudor, who belongsto the court.Yes, said the man, follow me, and 1Will bring you to him.With that he had him presently upinto the guard chamber, telling one otthe yeomen of the guard, there was one,that enquired for Harry Tudor.Replied the yeoman, I know him verywell ; if you please to go along with me,I’ll bring you to him immediately.So the cohler followed the yeaman,admiring very much the prodigious fineryof the rooms which he carried him thro'.He. thought within himself that the yeo¬man was mistaken in the person whomhe enquired for, for, said he, he whomi look for, is a plain, merry, honest fel¬low, his name is Harry Tudor; we dranktwo pots together not long since. I sup¬pose he may belong to some lord cr otherabout the court.I tell you friend, replied the yeoman,1 know him very well, do you hut fol¬low me, and I shall bring you to himstraight.%t15So going forward, he came into the.room where the king was, accompaniedwith seveial of his nobles who attendedh?m. ■' ' -';;r ' ■ ' ■ - ' \As soon as the yeomen had put up bythe arras, he spoke aloud : May it pleaseyohr Majesty hfere is One that ensures forHarry Tu be (The cobrer hea’ing this, thought hehad committed no less than treason :Therefore he up with his heels and ranfor it ; but not being acquainted withthe several turnings and rooms through,which’he came, lie was soon overtaken,:fcnd brought before the king ; whom the.cobler little thought to be the person heenquired after ; therefore, in a tremblingcondition he fell down upon his knees,saying, .May it please your grace, may it pleaseyour highness, I am a poor cobler, andenquired for one Harry Tudor, who isa very honest fellow, I mended tlje heelof his shoe not long since, for which hepaid me nobly, and ga*e me two pots toboot, but, 1 had him afterwards to myceller, where we drank part of a cup ofnappy ale and were very merry, till mywife Joan began to grumble, which putan end to our merriment for that time ;16but l told him I would coma to thecourt and see him as soon as convenient¬ly I could.Well said the King, don’t be troubled,do you know this honest. fellow ag*u}>if you could seediim._ (jpolej- . replied, ,Yes, that I rOahrong a thousand.Then, said the King, and benot afraid, but lock well about you,£ exadventure you may linj tb.^ fellowin this company.Whereupon the cobler arose, and look¬ed wistfully upon the king ami the restof his nobles, but it was to little or nopurpose ; for though he saw somethingin the king’s face, which he thought hehad seen before, yet he could not ima¬gine him to be Harry Tudor, whos.eheel of his shoe he had mended, and whohad been so merry with him at the inn,and at his own cellar.He therefore told the king he did notexpect to find Harry Tudor among suchfine folks as he saw there : but that theperson he looked for, was a plain hon¬est, and true hearted fellow. Adding, kwithal, thsit he w'as sure that did HarryTudor out know that he was come tocourt, h • would make him very wel¬come : for, says the cobler, when wa117parted, he charged me to «ome to courtand see him, which I promised I would,and accordingly I have made an holidayon purpose to have a (dass with him.* At which speech of the cobler’s theking had much ado to forbear laughingout, but keeping his countenance assteady as he could before the cobler, hespoke to the yeoman of the guard.Here, said he, take this honest coblerdown into my cellar, and let him drinkmy good health ; 1 will give orders thatHairy Tudor shall come to him presently.i• 1$ ,aSo away they went, the coWtr fit,i to leap oat ot his skin lor joy, not onlybecause he had come off'so well, but thathe should see his friend M^udor.CHAP.

But I’ll tell thee Harry,when 1 came lo court I was in a peck oftroubles how to find you out; but at last1 met with a man who told me he knewyou very well, and that he would bringme to you, but instead of doing so, hebrought me before the King, which had!almost frightned me out of my sevensenses; but in good faith, added thecobler, X am resolved to be merry witliyou since L have had the good fortuneof meeting with you at last.Ah ! that you shall, replied the King,we will be as merry as princesWith that he called for a large glassof wine, and drank to the coblcr, theKing’s good health.Good a mercy, said the cobler, honestHarry, 1’il pledge that health wdl allmy heart.Now after the cobler had drank sb«utfour -;r five good healths he began to bej fntrry, and fell a singing his old s,»ngsand catches, which pleased the King verymuch, and made him laugh heartily.W hen on a sudden, several of thenobles came into the cellar, extraordi¬narily rich in apparel, who all stood un¬covered before Harry Tudor, which$3put the cobler into great awfz«me»t atirst; but presently vecovering hrmself,fee looked more wistfully uj)on HarryTudor, which soon .nowing him to bethe king whom he saw in the presence i-'chamber, though in another habit, beimmediately fell upon his knees, saying, .May it please your grace, may it pleaseyour highness, l am a poor honest cobier, |and mean no harm.No, no, said the king, nor shall receiveany here, I assure you.He commanded him therefore to rise |and though he knew him to be the king,yet he should Use the same freedom withhim as he did before, when he mended "ithe heel of his shoe.This hind speech of the king’s, aadthree or four glasses of wine, made the ieobler to be in as good a humour as hewas before, telling the king several or •ids pretty stories, and singing some of 4his best songs, very much to live satisfac- Ttion of the king and all his nobles.StTHECOBLER’S SONG1NT THEKING’S CELLAR.T'q ihc tunc of-—J&My Cm.COME let us drink the other pot,Our sorrows to cenfourd.We’ll laugh and sing before the kiag,So let his health go round ;I am hold as bold can be,Ko cobler e’er was ruder ;Thett here, good fellow, here's to thee,fietxverab’riag Harry Tudor.S3When Pm at work within my stall,Upon him I shall think ;His kindness f to mind will call,H hene’er I eat or drink*His kii!(iue«8 wa? to me so great,* he like was never known.His kindnes? 1 shr.U still repeat,And so shall my wife Joan.I’ll laugh when I sit in ray stall,And merrily, will sing,'I,hat I with my poor last and awl,Am fellow with the king :But it is more, 1 must confess.Than I at first did know ;But Harry Tudor ne'ertheless,Resolves st shall be so*And now farewell unto Whitehall,I homeward must retire,To sing and whistle in my stall,My Soan will me desire.I do but think how she will laugh,When she hears of this thing, •That who drank her nut-brown ale,Was England's royal King.CHAP.

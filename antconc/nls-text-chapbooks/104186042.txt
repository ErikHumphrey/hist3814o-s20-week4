His very belly was a’1sunburnt liKe a piper's bag, ur the bead uf anauld drum, and yet his beard began to sprout outlike herring banes. He took thick brose to hisbreakfast, and baps and ale through the day, andwhen the coals selled dear, and the win’ was cauld,bought an oven-farl, and twa Dunbar Wadders,or a Glasgow Magistrate, which fish-wifes ca’sawastlin herrin’.His mither, auld Mary, plagued him ay in themorning ; she got up when the hens keckled, rip-ing the ribs, blew her snotterbox, primed her nose,kindled her tobacco-pipe, and at every pullbreathed out frettings against her hard fortune andlanely single life. O but a widow be a poorname; but I live in a wilderness in this lang-lonen, mony a man gaes by my door, but fewfolks looks in to poor Mary. Hoch bey, will Inever win out of this wearied life. Wa Sawny,man, wilt thou not rise the day ; the sun’s up,and a’ the nibours round about; Willie and Char¬lie is on the hill an hour syne, and half gate hameagain. Wilt thou rise an gie the beasts a bite,thou minds na them, I watman. Grump grump,quo Sawny, they got their supper an hour afterI got mine. Shut to dead come on them every jlane an they get a bit frae me till they work for’t-Sawny. But mither I’ve been dreaming thatI was married, an’ in the b< d aboon the bride;5I wonder gin it be true? Od, I ne’er got sic fun :'what will’t be, think ye ? how auld am 1 mither ?do you think I could man a hissyyet? fegs Ihave a mind to try ; but the saucy hissies will nahae me, I ken iveel enough.Mither. Say you lad, ay mony a hungry heartI wad be blytheo’you, but there was never asca’dJockey but there was a scabbed Jenny till himyet: dinna be scar’d lad.Sawny. A heeh, mither, I’se no be lordly an! I sud tak a beggar wife aft' the hi’ gate; but I’lltj tell ye something that I’m ay thinking on, buti ye maun na tell the neihbours, for the chielsi wad aye jaw me wi’t.Mither. Wad I tell o’ thee lad ? I wad tell o’mysel as soon.Sawmy. Do ye mind mither, that day I gadc|i to the Pans I ’cam*in by auld Mattie’s youri countrywoman, the Fife wife, it cam’ out o’ the1 town ye cam frae, the wife that says Be-go lad-1 dies, I gade there, an she was unco kind, andl( made me fat brose out of the lee side o’ her kail-j pot: thert was baith beef and paunches in’t; od1 they smell’d like ony haggis, and shined a’ like■I a gould fac’d w'aiscoat: fegs I suppit till I waslike to rive o’ them and had a rift o’ them the:| m an a’ day; when I came out I had a kite like1 a cow wi’ calf; she spiered for vou, mither, andI said ye was gaily; and she looked to me, and1leuch. and gripped my shakle-bane, and said Iwould be a sturdy fallow yet—I looked to her, |iand thought I liked her, and thinks on’t aye since !isyne: she leugh, and bade me seek out a coaldriver for her, for she didna like to carry a fish \creel.Mither. Forsooth, Sawny, I’ll gie my twalugs for a lav’rock’s egg if she binna in love wi’thee, and that will be a bargain.Sawny. An upon my word inither, she’s asturdy gimmer, well worth the smoaking after;she has a dimple on every cheek, an hauncheslike a sodjer’s lady’s hoop, they hobble when sheshakes, and her paps play nidlety nod when shegangs; I ken by her heckling she has a conceitof me.Mither. But Sawney naan, an thou see hermither Matty in the town, auld be-go laddie asyou ca’ her, gie her a dram, she likes it wee! ;spout ye a mutchkin of molash in her cheek,ye’ll get her mind, and speed the better.Sawny. But mither, how sud I do when Igang to court her? will I kiss her, an kittle herand fling her o'er as the duels do the hissesamang the hay. I‘ve seen them gang owre ither,and owre ither, and when they grip them by thewame, they'd cry like a maukin.7Mitlier. Hout awa, daft doug it thou is, that’sno the gate; thou maun gang in wi’ braw goodmanners, and something manfu’, put on a Sun¬day’s face, and sigh as ye were a saint, sit downI33;beside her, as ye were a Mess John, keek ayetill her now and then wi’ a stowen look, and handyour mouth as mim and grave as a May-puddock,ova whore at a christening; crack well o’ourwealth, and hide our poverty.Sawny. Ay, but mither there is some itherway in courting nor that, or the lassies would nacouple so close to them.Mither. Ay, but Sawny man there’s a timefor every thing, and that too ; when ye sit wherenaebody sees you, you may tak her head in youroxter like a creesh pig; dab nebs wi’ her nowand then ; but be sure you keep a close mouthwhen you kiss her, clap her cheeks and straikher paps, but for your drowning gang na fartherdown; but fouks that’s married can put their handto ony part they like.Sawny. xAha but mither I didna ken the firstword o’ courting, the lassie I’ll no ken what I’mcorn’d about.Mither. Ay will she lad, wink and keek wellto her, she’ll hae a guess, seek a quiet word ofher at the door, and gin it be-dark, gie her a bitwee kiss when ye hae tellftl her your errand, and8\gin they gie you cheese and bread, or ony meal,be sure you ca‘t guid, whether it be sae or no;and for my blessing, be mensfu wi your mouth,and dinna eat unca muckle, for 1‘ve seen you supas mony milk brose as would have saired twa mento carry on a barrow.Sawney. Aha, but mither yource lying now,for I never did it but ance, but an they set mes'i;afore me an I be hungry, deil claw the clungestan I binna upsides with it for the same. Adeedmither, fouk maun hae meat an they should neerget wives, and there some of them no worth curs¬ing, an a body werna setting an oath whether orno ; a hear ye that now, when ye put me till£t,and gar me speak, ay by my sooth, I would ratherhae a bit good poney and a pund of cheese, or Jwere bound to bab after ony hizzies buttocks 1see yet.Mither. Wa Sawny man, thou£s a fool, anthat£s a fault; gin every ane were as easy aboutwomen as thou is, the warld wad be a wildernessin a wee time, there wad be nae body to inhabitthe earth but brute beasts ; cats and dogs wad beworrying ither, and every thing wad gae to con¬fusion. Gae to the courting, ye dog that yeare) and either do something or nacthing at a£.END OF PART I.PART II.Up got Sawney in the morning, and swallowedowre sodded meat flag by flag; and aff he goesto the coals and the courting, lilting and singinglike a laverock in a May morning—O to be mar¬ried if this be the way*The colliers vrondered a’ to see him sae wellbuskit wi a pair of wally side auld-fashionedleather breeks of his father’s, and an auld creeshyhat, mair like a fryingpan than ony thing else ;a lang cravat like a minister or Baillie Duff at aburial, a clean face and hands, and nae less thana gun-sleeved linen sark on him, which made hischeeks to shine like a sherney weight, and thecolliers swore he was as brawr as a horse gaun toa cow's dredgy.But Sawny came off wi his coals, whistlingand whipping up the poor beasts, even as outrage¬ous as ony ram at riding time; well might onybody see there was a storm in Sawny’s nose, lightwhere it like ; for no sooner had he selled hiscoals, than he left his horse to come hame wi anibour callan, and gad keekin up the Cowgate,and through the closses, seeking auld Be-go, hisguid-mither to be ; then in through the fish-mar¬ket, where he bought twa lang herrin, and twabaps, a pair of suter's auld shoon, greased blackarul made new again, to make lus feet feasiblelike, as he kenil the lass would look at them (forhis mither teli’d him the women looked ay tothe mens legs or they married them, and theweel-legged loons gade ay best aft'.)So Sawny came swaggering through a theshell wives, but she was no there, going downthe town below the guard he met auld Be-gojust in the teeth, an she cries, Hey laddie mydow, how’s -your mither honest Mary? Thankyou, quo’ Sawny, she’s meat hale, aye workingsome—how’s a at hame, is Kate and the laddieweel ?Matty. Fu’ weel, my dow: ye’re a brawsonsy dog grown, a wallie fa’me gin I kend ye.Come, come, quo’ Sawny, and I’ll gie ye anossack to heat your wTame, it is a cauld day,and ye’re my mither’s countrywoman.Na, fair hi’ you, Sawny, I’ll nae refus’t; adram’s better the day than a clap on the arse wi’a cauld shule, sae follow me, my dow.So awa’ she took me, quo’ Sawny, down adark stair, to ane o’ the houses beneath the yird,where it was mirk as in a coal heugh, and theyhad a great fire. Sweet be wi me quo’ Sawny, forit minds me of the ill part; an a muckle pot hasa little cauldron, seething kail and roasting flesh,the wife forked them out as fast us she could into' J Jji coags and caps, for there came in a wheen tutorlike fallows, with black thumbs and creeshy ap¬rons, that cutted them all up in a wee time, butthey never fashed with us, nor we with them ; wefirst got a gill, and then got a het pint. A vowquoth I, Matty, is Kate gaun to get a man yet?Matty. A man laddie, wha wad hae her ? amuckle, lazy, useless jade; she can do naethingbut work at husband wark, card and spin, washladies rooms, and a gentleman’s bonny things;she canna tak a creel on her back, and apply tomerchandizing as I do, to win a man’s bread.Sawny. I think some of the fishers and hermight mak it up.Matty. A fisher, laddie ! haith the fishers wadrather hae a pickle good bait to their hooks, andtwa three bladders to their lines, than put up wi’the like of her, a stinking prideful jade, altho’ Ibore her, ay scourin and washin athersel, prickinand prinnin keeps, her face ay like a Flander sbaby, and naeless than ribbons and rings, and hershoon made of red clouts; a devil stick pride,when our auld guidams ran barefoot, and ourgutchers gade wi bare hips. Gie her a man! illthief stap a gouk in her arse first, that may crycuckow when e’er she speaks o’t; she can do nae-thinsf but scour ladies pishpots, and keep cleanthe tirlie-wherlies that hang about the fire : haith12she’s o’er gentle brought up to be a poor man 3penny-worth.Heigh how, quo’ Sawny, and ’tis e’en a greatpity, fot she’s weel-far’d lusty hissie; he had agreat kindness for her.Matty. A well-a-wat she’s no lingletailed, sheniajr be a caff bed to a good fallow, but an thouhad but seen me at her age, I was a sturdy gim-mer; there was nae a Hynd in a Dubbyside couldlay a corpen to a creel wi me, the fint a fallowin a Fife but I wad a laid on the bread of hisback, and a’ his gear uppermost, I was na a chick¬en to chatter wi indeed laddie, for I had a flanklike an ox, and a pair of cheeks like a chapmansarse.Sawny. Nae doubt but ye had a pair of beefybuttocks, for your very cheeks kings like leatherbags to this day ; but I’ll tell you what I’m gaunto tell you—do ye think that your Kate wad takme, an I would come to court her ?Matty. Tak you, laddie, tak you, faith she’lltak you, for she would tane a poor button thingof a half blind tailor, wartna me, a poor, blind,bowly, scabbit like creature; I’ve seen the day Iwad hae carried him in my pouch. Wode I’sewarrant her jump at you, like a fish at a flee, wadI say tak you, and she winna tak you, I’se takyou mysel, but she an I cust out the day about13her coekups and black caps, gar£d me say muckleof her; but shecs my sonsy dawty for a that;weel-a wat she's a weel-natured lassie, and ginshe turn an illnatured wife I canna tell.Sawny. A well then I’ll venture on her asshe is, for my mither’s pleased; an ye’re pleased,an I’m pleased; wode I am sure to get her, anthe taylor has nae bridled her; or tane a tryingtrot o’ her.Matty. But Sawny, man, I’ll tell you whatwe’ll do, I’ll hame and broach her the night on’t,an come ye the morn, we’ll male it fu’ fast in awee time,’ so thou’s get mair tocher than a Cram-on, gammon to gammon; she has baith blanketsand sheets, a covering, and twa cods o’ caff, acaff bed and bowster, and hear’st thou’ my laddie,I hae a bit auld hogger, and somethingin’t, thou’sget it when I die; but by my sooth it will be thelast thing that I’ll part wi’, I kenna what I mayneed yet—it is an auld wife that kens her ain weird.On this they paid their spout and parted ; butwhen Sawny came out, he stoited and staggeredlike a sturdy stot: molash was chief commander,for Sawny thought every body had twa headsand four een, and more noses than they needed5while in the dark house he sometimes thought itwas the morning of a new day : a hech, said he,when was I a night frae my mither before; shedl14(hink I am put in the guard, tane \vi‘ the deil orthe doctoi-s, or else married, and vvorkin ^ at thewanton trade of weans making^.Matty. Hute, daft laddie, the soup drink‘s inyour head, and gars ye think sae, this day andyesterday is ae day : ye‘11 be hame in braw timeyet.Sawny. A well, a well then, good day to you,good mither; ye maun gar Kate tuk me, or thieftak you a thegither: I'll hame and tell the lengthit’s come, and if it comes nae farther, it maun e’enstick there.Off lie goes, tacking about like a ship againstthe wind, as if he would knock holes in the wallsand windowss wi‘ his elbows ; he looked as fierceas a lion, with a red face like a trumpeter, and hisnose was like a bubbly jock‘s neb, as blue as ablawart: but or he wan half way hame his headturned heavier than his heels and mony a filthy <fa‘ he got, through thick and thin he plashed, tillhame he gets at last, grunting and gaping bythe wall, when auld Mary thought it was theirnibours sow, he was sae bedaubed wi dirt; by thetime she got him to bed, he was in a boiling-bar¬rel fever, and poor Mary grat wi grief.Sawny. Hech, hey ! but courting be a curstwark, and costly too: an marrying be as morti¬fying and murdering, the deil be married for me.Wither. Wa Sawny, man, what’s come o’erj thee now ? thou hast gotten skaith, some auhlwife has witcht thee, or the deil has dung theeo’er in some dirty midden ; where hast thou been,i or what hast thou seen ; thae een reel like a wild11 cat’s, and the sweat is hailing o’er thy nose;il thou’s witcht, thou’s witch’t, O man, what willill do.Bock, bock, gaed Sawney; but it could najvvin up for bubbles and herrin banes. Oh, quo’he, keep me in my bed for my days will soon bedone; a curse on your courting wark, for it haskilled me, and wives are but wicked things, Iken by the same.Wither. O dole, dole, my bairn has gottenilpoison, for the smell of it is like to poison me.Sawny. Gin herring and het ale be poison,there’ll no be mony left alive. Bock, bock, Oh,quo, Sawney the bed’s filed !Wither. O my bairn, thou was ay a cleanlybairn till now; thou’s surely lost thy senses whenthou files where thou lies, like the brute beasts:thou never did the like of this before since thouleft rocking of the cradle.PART IIIi;jtPoo Ft Sawny had a terrible night o’t, wi a16sair head and a sick heart, his eyes stood in hishead, his wame, caddied like ony cow’s milks, andpuddings crocket like a wheen puddocks in apool; his mither rocket and wrung her hands,crying, a wae be to the wife that brewed it, forI hae lost a weel foster’d bairn wi’ their stinkingstuff, a meikle deil ding the doup out of theircaldron, my curse come on them and their whisky-pots, it’s brunt him alive; ay, ay, my bairn he’sgone.But about the break of day, his wind brak likethe bursting of a bladder, O happy deliverance,cried Mary his micher ; tho’ dirt bodes luck, andfoul farts hie the blankets, I wish ne’er waur beamong us. The next thing that did Sawnygood, was three mutchkins of milk made intothin brose, and a pickle hue pepper in them, yethe had a soughing in his lugs like a saw-mill,and every thing gade round about wi’ him a’ thatday ; his mither gat him out of bed, and put himin the muckle chair wi a’ pair of blankets abouthis shoulders, a cod at his back, and a het brickto his soles, to gar him trow he was nae well,and there he sat like a lying-in wife, crackinglike a Holladdie, and ate twa dead herrin’ anda crust, telling a the outs and ins about the bri¬dal, and when it was to be, for he had gottenevery body’s consent but the bride’s about it.Mitlier. But Sawny, man, that’s the ma*nthing ; ye maun hae that too.Sawny. Na, na, mither, I’m the main thingmyself, aye she’s but a member; the men maunaye be foremost—gang what way it will, I’se ayebe uppermost.Mither. But Sawny man, what way is thougaun to do ? will ye make a penny wedding ; ortwa or three gude neebours, a peek of meal ba-ken, wi a cheese and a barrel of ale; wall that do ?Sawny. Na na mither, I’ll take a cheapergate nor ony of them; I’ll gar-a-crown and halfa mutchkin, or a rake of coals do it a’, then abody has nae mair to do but piss and tumble intobed.Mither. Na na, my man Sawny, I hae monya time heard thy honest father say, that never aane would do well that capstrided the kirk orcuckold the minister.Sawny. A tell nae me, mither, of the minis-;er, they’re aye for their ain end as wrell as ither‘ouk, and if a poor beggar body had a bit w-eann christen, the deil a beit they-11 feike him o’t.Mither. Hute awa man, there’s na body hascans but what has siller to pay the christeningf them ; or if they be that poor, they sudna getae weans, and they wadna be fashed syne.Sawnv» Ha ha mither. the poor fouk, likeISthe lice, ay wheu they meet they many, andmaksmae of them: and I think the ministers mightchristen their bits of weans for naething-, thewater’s no sae scant; they are weel paid for theirpreaching, they may very weel baith marry andchristen a’ the poor fouks into the bargain, bythe way of a maggs.Mither. Ay, ay, my man Sawny, marriage isa sw'eet thing for young fouk, and the bed un¬defiled.Sawny. What the vengeance, mither, do yethink a body’s to file the bed every night becausethey did it ance.Mither. Na, na that’s no what I mean; it isthe happiness that fouk hae that’s married, besidethe lonesome life that I hae, lying tumbling andgaunting in a bed my lane: O sirs, but a man inbed be a useful body, an it were but to claw ancsback, as for a body’s foreside they can claw' itthemselves.Sawny. Ah mither, mither, ye hae fun a stringagain ; I think ye might a wanted all your days,when ye hae wanted sae lang: ye hae plenty of •baith milk and meal, snuff and tobacco; but ye jsmell at the crack of a whip, I kend my mitherwad ride yet, for I’ve seen her fit waggan this j.lang time.Mither A dear Sawny man, an thou wereance fairly aff the fodder, I’ll be cast into a holeof a house by mysel, where I’ll just lye andbreak my heart, and weary myself to death; butan I could get a bit honest weaver, a cobbler, orsome auld tailor by the tail, I would tackle to himyet, let the country clash as they please about it'Sawny. A well, a well mither, tak your ainflight, there’s nae fool like an auld fool; for themorn I’ll be aff or on wi’ thehissie I hae in hand.So on the morrow Sawny got all his claes clean¬ed, his hair eametl and greased with butter, andIris face as clean as if the cat had licked it, andaway he goes singing.I will buy a pound of woo’,I will wash’t and mak a plaidy,I’m gaun ower the muir to woo’,Carlin, is your daughter ready.Now poor Sawny, although he sang, he wasas pale as a ghost from the grave ; his face waswhitely white, like a weel bleached dishclout,and he looked as if he had been eaten and spuedagain ; but at length he came to the bride’s door,and in he goes with a brattle, crying, how’s allhere the day ? and what’s corned of thy mitherlassie? O Saunders, cpio the bride she’s awa tothe town : what came of ye yesterday, she waitedon you the whole day, ye part her lose a day’strade lad, and she is awa this morning cursinglike a heathen, and swearing Be-go that ye haegien her the begunk.Sawny. A dole woman, I took a sudden blastin the hame gaun and was never sae near dead inmy life.And wha think you was in company wi Katethe bride, but the wee button of a tailor, who satand sewed on a table, cocking like a t—d on atrencher; but when he kent wha was come, heleaped down on the floor, coost a dash of pridelike a little bit prince, bobbet about, and so outhe goes, with the tear in his eye, and his tail be¬tween his feet, like a half worried dog.Sawny. Now, Katie, do ye ken what I’mcorned about?Kate. O yes, my mither te!l{d me: but 1‘mno ready yet, I hae twa gowns to spin and thingsto make.Sawny. Hiife, things to make, ye hae asmony things as ye'll need, woman ; canna ye spingowns in your ain house wi me, as weel as here,wi an auld girning mither?Kate. But dear Saunders, ye maun gie abody time to think on't—‘twad be ill-far'd to rushthe gither just at the first.Sawnv. And do ye think I hae naething adobut come here every ither day hoiting after you,it ■will no do ! I maun be either aff or on \vi’ you,either tak me or tell me, for I ken of ither twa,and some of you I’ll hae, for as I’m a sinner, mymither is gaun to be married too, an she can getony bit man of ony shape or trade.Kate. Indeed, then, Saunders, since you’rein such haste, ye maun e’en tak them that’s read¬iest, for I’m no ready yet.Sawny. Dear woman, when your mither andi: my mither’s pleased, and I am willing to venturecn ye, what a sorrow ails you ?Kate. Na, na, I’ll think on’t twa or threeI days; its o’er lang a term to see without aI thought.|| Sawny. Wode I think ye’re a camstrerie piecera of stuff; its true enough what your mither saidy of ye, that ye’re no for a poor man.Kate. And what mair said she of me ?Sawny. Wode, she said ye could do naethingci| but wash mugs, and scour gentleman’s bonny[:J things, but hissies that is bred amang gentletl houses, minds me of my mither’s cat; but ye’re« far costlier to keep, for the cat wastes neithersape nor water, but spits in her loof, and washesher ain face, and wheens of you can do nae itherthing; and up he gets.Kate. O Saunders, but ye be short, can ycno stay till my mither come hame?Savvny. I’ve staid lang' enough for ony thingI ’ m to be the better; and I’m nae sae short asyour totum of a tailor, that I could stap in myshoe, sae could I e’en.Ilame he goes in a passion, and to his bed heran, crying, O death ! death ! I thought the jadewad a jumped at me: no comfort nor happinessmair for me. O mither, gae bake my burialbread, for I’ll die this night, or soon the morn.But early next morning in comes auld Be-go hisguid mither, wha had left her daughter in tearsfor slighting of Sawny, and hauls him and hismither awa’ to get a dinner of dead fish ; wherea’ was agreed upon, and the wedding to be uponWednesday, no bridal fouks but the twa mithers,and themselves twa.So according to appointment, they met atEdinburgh, where Sawny got the cheap priest,who gave them twa three words, and twa threelines, took their penny and a guid drink, wishedthem joy, and gade his w^a’s. Now, said auldBe-go, if that be your minister, he's but a drunk¬en b—h, mony a ane drinks up a’, but he leavesnaething ; he’s got the penny for diel a hate, yemight cracket lufes on’t, tane ane anither’s wTord,a kiss and a hoddle at a hillock side, and been a-'/•a;ifweel, if no better: 1 hae seen some honest mansay mair o’er their brose nor what he said a’ thegither ; but an ye be pleased, I’m pleased; aboutin the bed ends a’, and makes sure wark—sohere’s to you, and joy to the bargain its endedimw, well I wat.Lewis XI. although an unprincipled Prince,(of whom it was remarkable, that he did notscruple to perjure hiniself, except when he sworeby the leaden Image of the Virgin) was yet veryattentive to every circumstance that could in- *crease the wealth and happiness of his subjects.He behaved with the greatest affability to such 1merchants whose superior knowledge could sug¬gest any means of extending the benefits of com¬merce ; and that he might engage them to bemore communicative, he frequently invited themto his table. A merchant, named Mr. John in- »toxicated by the familiarity of the King, whovery often admitted him in particular to dine withhim, took it in his head one day, to request his ’Majesty to grant him letters of nobility. The ;f.King did not refuse his request; but when the 5<|new nobleman appeared at court, he affected not *to know him. Mr. John, surprised at this unex- ipected reception, could not forbear complainingof it: “ Go about your business, Mr. John, I Jmean my Lord,” said the King: “ When I usedto invite you to my table, I considered you asthe first of your profession ; but now I wouldinsult my nobles, if I would treat you with thesame distinction.”THE END.

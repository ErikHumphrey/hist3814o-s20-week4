bright white palm /he always had.Glorious it was for to behold ;Her face did /hine like to the fun,Like threads of gold her hair hang downHer eyes like lamps unto the moon,Of precious ftones rich was her crown;Angels and faints did welcome her.The heavenly choir did fing, rejoice :King David with his harp was there:The /liver bells made a great noife,24 THE WIFE OF BEITH.Such mulic and fuch melody.Was never either heard or feen.When this poor faint was plac’d fo high,And of all fins made freely clean :But then when thus fhe was pofieft,And looked back on all her fears :And that fhe was

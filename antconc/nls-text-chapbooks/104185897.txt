Come into the kitchen, and stand by the fire ;i Then she thank’d the lady, and went in with haste,) Where she was gaz’d on from biggest to least.1 And being well warmed, her hunger being great,They gave her a dish of good meat for to eat;i And then to an out-house this creature was led.Where she with fresh straw then made her a bed.. And when in the morning the day-light she saw,' Her rich robes and jewels she hid in the straw ;!. And being very cold, she then did retire,1 To go to the kitchen, and stand by the fire.The cook said, my lady hath promis’d that thouShall be as a scullion to wait on me now ; »What sayest thou, girl? art thou willing to bide ?With all my heart, truly, to him she reply’d.4To work -with her needle she conhl very well,And for raising of paste, few could her excel;Site being very handy, the cook’s heart did win.And then she was call’d by the name of Cat-skin.PART III.This lady had a son both comely and tall.Who often-times nsed to bo at a ball;A mile out of town in an evening-tide,To see the ball acted away he did ride.< 'at-skins said to his mother, madam, let me< Jo after your son, this fine ball for to see ;With that in a passion this lady flew,Struck her with a ladle which she broke in two.And being thus serv’d, she then weiit away,And with a rich garment hefself did array;Then to see this hall with speed did retire,Wlrere she danc’d so rarely, all did her admire.The sport being done, the young squire did say.Young lady, where do you live, tell me, I pray ?Her answer was unto him, I will tell,At the sign of the broken ladle I dwell.She being very nimble, got home first ’tis said.And with her cat-skin robe she soon was array’d,And into the kitchen again she did go,Hut where she had been, none of them did know.Xext day, the young squire himself to content,To see the ball acted, away then he went;She said, pray, let me go this ball for to see,Then struck her witli a skimmer, and broke it in three.Then out of doors she ran with heaviness,And with her rich garments herself then did dre^s;For to see this hall she ran away with speed.And to see her dancing, all wonder’d indeed.5The hall being ended, the young squire thenSaid, where do you live? she answer’d'again,Sir, because you ask me, an account I will give.At the sign of the broken skimmer I live.Being dark then, she last him, and homeward did hie.And with her cat-skin robe was drest presently ;And into the kitchen among them she went.But where she had been they were all innocent.When the squire came home and found Cat-skin thereHe was in amaze, and began for to swear.For two nights at this ball has been a lady.The sweetest of beauties that e’er I did see.She was the best dancer in all the whole place.And very much like our Cat-skins in the face ;Had she not been drest to that comely degree.I'd sworn it had been Cat-skins bodily.I Xcxi day to this ball he did go once more.Then she ask’d his mother to go as before ;And having a bason of water in hand,She threw it at Cat-skins, as I understand.Shaking her wet ears, out of doors she did ran.And dressing herself, when this thing she had done.To see this ball acted, she then went her ways.To see her fine dancing all gave her the praise.And having concluded, this young squire heSaid, from whence come you ? piny, lady tell me.Her answer was, sir, you soon shall know the same.From the sign of the bason and water I came.Then homeward she hurry’d as fast as might be.This young squire he -then was resolved to seeWhereto she belong’d: and following Cat skin,! Into an old house he saw her creep in.6He said, 0! brave Cat-skins, I find it is theeThese three nights together have so charmed me ;Thou art the sweetest creature my eyes e’er beheld,With joy and contentment my heart it is fill’d.Thou art the cook’s scullion, but as I have life,Grant me but thy love, and I’ll make thee my wife ;And you shall have maids to be at your call,Sir, that cannot be, I’ve no portion at all.Thy beauty is a portion, my joy and my dear,I prize it far better than thousands a-year;And to have my friends’ consent, I have got a trick,I’ll go to my bed and feign myself sick.There’s none shall attend me but thee, I protest,So one day or other, when thou art drestIn thy rich dress, if my parents come nigh,I’ll tell them ’tis for thee I’m sick and like to die.PART IV.Having thus consulted, this couple parted,Next day this squire he took to his bed,And when his dear parents this thing perceiv’d.For fear of his death they were heartily griev’d.To tend him they sent for a nurse presently,He said, none but Cat-skins my nurse now shall be ;His parents said, no, son ; he said, but she shall,Or else I shall have no nurse at all.His parents both wondered to hear him say thus,That none but Cat-skins must needs be his nurse ;So then his dear parents, their son to content,Up to the chamber poor Cat-skins they sent.Sweet cordials and other rich things were prepar'd.Which between this couple were equally shar’d,And when they were alone in each other’s arms,Enjoy’d one another in love’s pleasant charms.*At length on a time, poor Cat-skins, ’tis said.In her rich attire she was array’d ;And when that his mother the chamber drew near.Then much like a goddess Cat-skins did appear,Which caus’d her to startle, and thus for to say,What young lady is this, son, tell me, I pray ;He said, why, ’tis Cat-skins, for whom sick I lie.And without I have her, with speed I shall die.! His mother ran down then to tell the old knight.Who ran up to see this amazing great sight;He said, why, ’tis Cat-skins we hold in such scorn,I ne’er saw a finer dame since I was born.The old knight said to her, I pray thee, tell me,From whence dost thou come, and of what family ;Then who were her parents she gave him to know,And what was the cause of her wandering so.The squire cry’d, if you will save my life,Pray, grant this young creature she may be my wifeHis father reply’d, thy life for to save,If you are agreed, my consent you shall have.Next day with great triumph and joy, as we hear.There was many coaches both from far and near ;Then much like a goddess dress’d in rich array,Cat-skins to the squire was married that day.For several days this great wedding did last,Where were many a topping and gallant rich guest;And for joy the bells rang over the town,And bottles of canary roll’d merrily down.When Cat-skin was married, her fame for to raise,To see her modest can-iage all gave her great praiseThus her charming beauty the squire did win,. And who lives so great as he and Cat-skin ?8PART V.Now, in the fifth part I’ll endeavour to showHow things with her parents and sister did, go ;Her mother and sister of life are bereft,And now all alone the old squire is left.And hearing his daughter was married so brave.He said, in my noddle a fancy I have ;Press'd like a poor man, a journey I’ll make,And see if she on me some pity will take.Then dress’d like a beggar he went to her gate.Where stood his daughter, who appear’d very great:1 le cried, noble lady, a poor man I be,And I am now forc’d to crave your charity.With a blush she ask’d him from whence he came,With that he then told her, and gave her his name:She said. I’m your daughter, that you slighted so.Nevertheless to you some kindness I’ll show.Through mercy the Lord hath provided for me.Pray, Father then come in, and sit down, said she ;Then the best provisions the house could aftbrd,For to make him welcome were set on the board.She said, you are welcome, feed, heartily I pray.And if you are willing, with me you shall staySo long as you live ; then he made this reply,I only am come thy love for to try.Through mercy, my child, I’m rich, and not poor,I have gold and silver enough now in store,And for the love which at thy hand I have found.For a portion I’ll give thee ten thousand pound.So in a few days after, as I understand,This man he went home, and sold off all his land ;He ten thousand pounds to his daughter did give.And then altogether in love they did live.

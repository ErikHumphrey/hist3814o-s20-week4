'H.. 20The father shook his head—My s»aYou know not what you ask,To drive a gig in crowded streetsIs no such easy taskThe horses full of rest and corn.Scarce I myself can guide,And much I fear if you attempt.Some mischief will betide.Then think, dear boy, of something elseThat’s better worth your wishing,A bow and quiver, bats and balls,^ A rod and lines for fishing.But nothing could young-Jehu pleaseExcept a touch at driving ;'Twas all in vain, his father found*- To spend his breath in striving.At least, attend, rash boy ! he cried.And follow good advice,Or in a ditch both gig and youWill tumble in a trice.Spare, spare the whip, hold hard the reins.The steeds go fast enough ;Keep in the middle beaten track,Nor cross the roads so rough;And when within the town you come*Be sure with special care,Brive clear of signs, posts, booths, and stalls,And monsters of the fair.21the youth scarce heard his father eut.But roar’d, bring out the whisky :With joy he view’d the rolling wheels.And prancing ponies frisky.He seiz’d the reins and up he sprung.And wav’d the whistling lash;Take care ! take care ! his father cried :But off he went slap dash.Who is this light spark, the horses thought,We’ll try your strength young master iSo o’er the rugged turnpikfc road.Still faster ran and faster.%Young Jehu tott’ring in his seat,Now wish’d to pull them in ;But pulling from, so young a handThey valued not a pirt.\A drove of gruntii^ pigs beforeFill’d up the narrow way :Dash through the midst the horses drove,And made a rueful day jFor some were trampl’d under foot.Some crush’d beneath the wheel;Lord how the drivers curst and swore,And how the pigs did squeal.A farmer’s wife on old blind Ball,Went slowly on the road,With butter, eggs, and cheese, and creaw,In two large panniers stow’d*22Ere Ball could stride the rut amaiij,The gig came thundering on,Crash went the panier, and the dameAnd Bail lay overthrown.Now through the town the mettled pairRan rattling o’er the stones,They drove rfie crowd from side to side,And shook poor Jehu’s bones.When lo ! directly in the course,A monstrous form appear’d $A shaggy bear that stanc'd and roar'd,On hinder legs uprear’d.Sideways they started at the ^ight,And whisk’d the gig half round,Then cross the crowded market placeThey flew with furiocts bound.First o'er a heap of crockery ^tare,'The rapid car they whirl’d ;And jugs and mags and pots and pans.In fragments wide were hurl’d.A booth stood near, with tempting cakesAnd grocery richly fraught}All Birmingham on 'tother side,The dazzling optics caught.With active spring the nimble steedsRush'd through the pass between,And scarcely touch'd ; the «ar behindGoi through not quite so alean.23For whife^one wheel one stall engag'd.Its fellow took the other;Dire was the clash, down fell the booths.And made a dreadful pother.Nuts, oranges, and ginger-bread.And figs here roll’d around,And scissars, knives, and thimbles thereBestrewed the glittering ground.b/ ■ ' * •i ' * -The fall of boards, the shouts and cries,Urg'd on the horses faster ;And as they flew, at every stepThey caus'd some new disaster.Here lay o’erturn’d in woeful plightA pedlar aftd his pack,There in a showmas’s broken box,All London went to rack.But now the fates decreed to stopThe ruin of the day,And make the gig and driver tooA heavy reckoning pay.A ditch there lay both broad and deep,Where streams as black as StyxIFrom every quarter of the townTheir muddy currents mix.Down to its brink in heedless hasteThe frantic horses flew,And in the midst, with sudden jerk,Their burden overthrew.24The prostrate gig with desperate forceThey soon pull'd out again,And at their heels in ruin dire,Dragg'd lum'bring o'er the plai».Here lay a wheel, the axle there.The body there remain'd,Till sever'd limb from limb, the carNo name nor shape retained.But Jehu muat not be forger.Left floundering in the flood.With clothes aH drench’d and mouth and eyesBeplaster’d o'er with mad.In piteous case he waded throughAnd gain'd the slippery side,Where grinning crowds were gather'd roundTo mock his fallen pride.They led him to a neighbouring pumpTo clean his dismal face.Whence cold and heartless home he slunk,Inveil’d in sore disgrace.And many a bill for damage done,\ His father had to pay.Take warning youthful drivers aiBFrom Jehu’s first essay.

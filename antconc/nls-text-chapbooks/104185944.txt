Westminster, such lots of peoplemustered ;But, howsomdever, in the crowd I got myself a station,And there I waited anxiously to see the Coronation.f ol lol lol, &3.Somehow a soldier’s prancing horse,

I, I've seenthat I can see,So out I got, and found that I’d paid dearly for imfancy ;I’d lost a sovereign and my purse, and on examina¬tion,My watch which ne’er did go before, did go at

Christmas holiday :The baron beheld with a father’s pride,His beautiful child young Lovel’s bride :While she with her bright eyes seem’d to beThe star of the goodly company.Oh the missletoe bough,Oh the missletoe bough.“ I’m weary of dancing now,” she cried,“ Hero, tarry a moment, I’ll hide, I’ll hide ;And hovel be sure thou’rt the first to trace,The clue to my secret lurking place.,’Away she ran, and her friends began,Each tower to search, and each nook to scan ;And young hovel cried, “ Oh where dost thou hide,I’m lonesome without thee, my own dear bride.”Oh the missletoe bough, &c.They sought her that night, and they sought her nextday,And they sought her in vain, when a week pass’daway;In the highest—the lowest—the loneliest spot,Young hovel sought wildly, but found her not;And years flew by, and their grief at last.Was told as a sorrowful tale long past;And when hovel appear’d, the children cried,See, the old man weeps for his fairy bride.”Oh the missletoe bough, &c.aM length an old chest that had long lain hid,Was found in the castle—they raised the lid,And a skeleton form lay mouldering there,In the bridal wreath of the lady fair.Oh sad was her fate, in sportive jest,She hid from her lord in the old oak chest.It clos’d with a spring, and the bridal bloomLay withering there in a living tomb.Oh the missletoe bough, &c.THE FRIAR OF ORDERS GRAY.It was a Friar of orders grayWalked forth to tell his beads ;And he met with a lady fair,Clad in a pilgrim’s weeds.Xow Heaven thee save, thou reverend friar,I pray thee tell to me,If ever at your holy shrineMy true love thou didst see ?And how should I your true love knowFrom many another one?0, by his cockle hat and staff,And by his sandal shoon.0 lady, he is dead and gone.Lady he’s dead and gone ;And at his head a green grass-turf.And at his heels a stone.6Yet stay, fair lady, rest a while,Beneath yon cloister wall;See, through the hawthorn blows the cold wind.And drizzling rain doth fall.°0 stay mo not, thou holy friar,0 stay me not I pray ;No drizzling raiu that falls on meCan wash my fault away.BILLY O’ROURKE.I greased my brogues and cut my stick,At the latter end of May, sir.And off for Dublin I set out.To sail upon the sea, sir.Then next to England I would go.To reap the hay and corn, sir,To leave old Ireland far behind,The place where I was born, sir.With my shillelah coh,And my heart so true.Oh, Billy O’Rourke's the boy, sir.I paid the captain six thirteens,To carry me over to Margate,Before we got half over the waves,It blew at a hell of a hard rate.The great big stick that grew out of the ship.Began to roar and whistle,iAucLtke sailors all, both great and small,Cries, Pat, you will go the devil.With mj, &e..lie ,olirn « xnr,m mf 0 'Some fell upon their bended knees,The ladies

sae well,There’s naething half sae canty—grand,As blythe Dumbarton’s dell ;And would you speer the reason why,The truth I’ll fairly tell,A winsome lassock lives hard byDumbarton’s bonnie dell.Up by yon glen Loch Lomond laves,Where bold M‘Gregors dwell ;And bogles dance o’er heroes’ graves.There lives Dumbarton’s belle ;She’s blest with every charm in life.And this I know full well—I’ll ne’er be happy till my wifeIs blythe Dumbarton’s belle.

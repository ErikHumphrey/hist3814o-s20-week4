MONEY-CATCHING,WAY TO TttEIYE, BY TURNING A PENNY TOADVANTAGE;WITH A NEW METHOD OPREGULATING DAILY EXPENSES.aj a- a.OT 7KK3 ; A O^nM' '}V 7« : It ■ T ?

Andthis sort of trading is now generally in use in oi}rforeign plantations, to supply the want of mon¬ey. But in process of time, as trading increased,so did luxury begin to abound ; and as luxury a-bounded, so men’s wants grew greater, whichbegat a necessity of some other way of commerce,and this was money ; which is of such antiquity,that Josephus tells us, that Cain, (the son ofAdam, and the first born of men) was very greedyin gathering money together, though of whatmetal that money was made, and whether it wascoined or not he is silent.Herodotus writeth that the first that coined4silver and gold, to buy and sell with, were theLydians. For silver and gold being the mostprecious of metals, were so much valued, thatwhatever any man wanted, might be purchasedfor it.Homer indeed tells us that before the siege ofTroy, men used to change or barter one commo¬dity for another. But it is undeniable that mon¬ey was in use long before that time; for w henAbraham purchased the field of Machpelah, andthe field in which it was, for a burying place forhis family, he gave four hundred shekels of sil¬ver for it: which the secret texts tells us wascurrent money with the merchant; and that w'asabout the year of the world 2088, which wasnear 700 years before the destruction of Troy.But though the money was current with the mer¬chant, yet I question whether it was coined ornot; for it rather appears, that it received its valuefrom its weight than from any stamp, that wasupon it: the weight of an shekel being a quar¬ter of an ounce, and the true value of that 15pence of our money. Abraham paid £25 Eng¬lish money, for that burying place.We read likewise of pieces of silver, or silver-lings, before this, which W’as current money a-mong the nation at that day ; for Abimelech, kingof Gerar, having taking Abraham’s wife from him,.upon a supposition that she was his sister whenhe came to understand the truth of the matter,not only restored his wife to him again, but alsogave him a thousand pieces of silver or silverlings;the value of which thousand pieces (each piecebeing worth 2s 6d) came to £125-I0s. which atthat day was a noble present for a king to give.But besides shekels and silverlings, there weretalents also, the weight of which was 75 ounces.A talentof silver contained>the value of £ 187. 16 s.Of each of these coins there is frequent mentionin the Holy Scriptures of-the Old Testament.In the New Testament, Our Saviour command¬ed Peter to take up the fish that first came tohand, and when he had opened its mouth heshould find therein a piece of money, which hewas to take and give the tax-gatherers for hisMaster and himselft which piece of money wrascalled a Stator, which consisted of half an ounceof silver, the value of which was 2 shillings.And when the Jew:s came to ensnare our Saviour,about the lawfulness of paying tribute to Caesar,he desired them to shew the tribute-money, andthey shewed him a penny, of value 7d-halfpenny ;and that this money was coined and stamped,appears by our Saviours asking,them, whose im¬age and superscription was upon it? to winchthey answered, Ckesar.GBut I need not quote Scripture to prove thatthe Jews and Romans used to coin money, theimage and superscription giving a value to it, andpromoting the currency of it; for silver was coinedin Rome, in the year of the world 3672, whichwas about 300 years before the Christian mra.History tells us that silver was first of all coin¬ed in the Isle Engina and that in Rome it wasstamped with the impression of a chariot and hor¬ses. And Janus caused brass to be coined witha face on the one side, and a ship on the other,in memory of Saturnus, who arrived there in aship. Servius Tullius, a king of the Romans,first coined brass with the image of a sheep andan ox. And in some places leather cut into pie¬ces has had the stamp of authority put upon it,and so it was made to pass for money. And inNew England, the Indians have money whichthey call Wampompege, which is of two sorts,one white, which they make of the stem or stockof the periwinkle, which they call Meteaubockt,when all the shell is broken oft’; and of this sortsix of their small beads, (which they make withholes to string the bracelets) are current with theEnglish for a penny. The other sort is blackinclining to blue, which is made of the shell of afish, which they call Pequanhock; and of thissort three make an English penny. They wholive upon the sea-side generally make of it, andas many make as will, none being denied the li¬berty of making it. This coin of money the In¬dians set such a value upon, that they bring downall sorts of furs which they take in the country,and sell to the Indians and English too, for thisIndian money; and the currency of it amongthem, makes them look on it as a good equival¬ent for what commodites they have to sell.Both the English, Batch, and French tradeingto the Indians with it, above six hundred milesnorth and south from England ; which is suffi¬cient to shew, that the use of money is very an¬cient, and is made use of by all nations in trade¬ing with each other; and was first invented asa medium in trade, and an equivalent to all sortsof commodities.The Misery of those that want Money and arein Debt.There is no wise man that will covet moneyfor itself, but for the use that is to be made ofit; for money itself cannot satisfy ; and so we aretold by the wisest of men, Eccles. v. 10. He thatloveth silver shall not be satisfied with silver;nor he that loveth abundance with increase.’'—In a time of famine, or in a besieged city, a mansmay have money enough by him, and yet maywant a pieee of bread. Money therefore is prizednot for itself but for its use; beeause, as Solo¬mon also says, “ Money answers all things.’'And seeing without money a man can have no¬thing, they mustbe very miserable that are with¬out it.Charity, in this last and iron age of the world,is grown so cold, that there is scarce any thingto be got upon that account. If you are cold,charity will not warm you; neither, if you arehungry will it dll your belly ; but if you havemoney, you may do both.If you have money, you may become one ofthe Livery-men of London, an Assistant, a War¬den, or a Master- of a Company : but if you wantmoney, you will never arrive to the honour of abeadle; for even for such an inferior employmentyou must make friends, and that cannot be donewithout bribes, nor can you bribe without money.If you have money, you may be an honest man,and a good man ; but if you want money, youmust be a knave by consequence.Enquire of a rich man among his neighbourswhat he is, meaning only whether he be a sub¬stantial man, and one that is responsible; and,they will presently tell you, <( he’s a very goodman I’ll assure you though at the ^9with respect to his morals, he is as profligate afellow as any in the whole parish, and one thatlives by oppressing his neighbours, and doing allmanner of injustice; his money making amendsfor all his enormities.-I knew a certain tradesman in London, thathad an uncle, a rich, covetous fellow, that wasworth many a thousand ; this poor man addressedhimself to his uncle, to give him a £100 to sethim up ; but he knew the worth of money betterthan to part with it, before death forced it fromhim, and told him plainly, he w'ould give him no¬thing w'hile he lived, but it might be he wouldleave him something when he died, especially ifhe found him industrious, and that he put him¬self in a w7ay to live. The poor man had but, lit¬tle money, and less credit, and how to put him¬self in a way to live he knew not; his trade beingnone of the best for journeymen. How'ever pick¬ing up a little credit at one place, and a little atanother, he addressed himself to the company hewas free of and would fain have borrowed £50of them; but truly they would not lend it him,but upon such security as he could not procure;in this extremity having put himself into a shop,he goes again to his uncle, to desire him to lendhim a little money, telling him he had set up intrade, and was got into a shop, but wanted mon-in a t..-, .10ey to carry on his business, ami desired him tolend him a little. His uncle finding he was get¬ting into a way, out of his generosity lends him£20 ; but makes him give him a bond to pay himin a year’s time.. The poor man had almost as■well been without his money, as to have been un¬der such an obligation; but he was resolved tokeep touch with himr though he lived so poorlyall the while that he was the scorn of all hisneighbours and fellow tradesmen, who looked up¬on him as a poor and consequently a pitiful fellow:but for all that he paid his uncle the £20 withinthe time limited; which his uncle took so well,that he told him', since he took such care tokeep his word, he would remember him anothertime. And so he did ; for having neither wifenor child, when he died, he divided his estate a-mongst his relations, and left this poor kinsmanof his,, thirty thousand pounds in ready money,and £1500 per annum.. And now this poor man,whose poverty made him the scorn of his neigh¬bours and acquaintances before, became a verygood man all on a sudden, insomuch that thecitv took notice of him, and chose him sheriff thevery next year and the company that before re¬fused to lend him £50, now chose him theirmaster, and were all his humble servants; and hewas applauded and cried up by every one. Heren1 was now a mighty change, and yet the man was: the same still; it was money only made theI difference. Judge therefore whether want of: money be not an extraordinary misery, and a; great unhappiness.This puts me in mind of a story, I have heard' related of Jocelin Percy, Esqr., brother to thei Earl of Northumberland, who going by a but¬cher’s shop, near Cow-Cross affronted his dog,I who thereupon fell a-barking at him, and theEsquire drew his sword and run him through.The butcher, who wTas troubled for the loss ofhis dog, charged a constable with the Esquire,who carried him before a Justice that knew himnot; the Justice asked him why he killed thebutcher’s dog ? The Esquire answered him very1 carelessly, because the dog ran at him. Ran atyou ! says Mr. Justice. How did he run at you ?To which Percy ( being a comical sort of a man )replied, He ran at me thus, Bough! wough!wough! and therewith taking a little run at theJustice, threw him and his chair down together!Which Mr. Justice looked upon as such affrontto his worship, that nothing would atone for, butcommitting him to Newgate, aggravating thecrime of killing the butcher’s dog, telling him,his dog was his servant, and that for ought heknew, himself or some of his gang, designed toi2rob his ship; but he would make an example ofhim. Percy seemed very little concerned atwhat the Justice said, which provoked him themore; and therefore he called the clerk to makehis mittimus, who asking’ him what his namewas, he said Jocelin. What besides Jocelin ?said the Clerk, Percy, said he. Of what place ?replied the. Clerk. Of Northumberland-house,near to Charing-Crossj said he. The Justicehearing this and knowing there was a very com¬ical gentleman of that name, who was brother tothe Earl of Northumberland, then a great favour¬ite with his Majesty, changed his tone at once,and asked him if he was brother to the Earl ? Onbeing answered in the affirmative, he addressedhimself to the butcher in an angry tone, tellinghim that he would examine into the affair, andthat he would learn him better than let his- dogloose to molest gentlemen as' they walked thestreet, - and that he would have him bound overto the peace at the Quarter-Sessions for his futurebehaviour. Which he would have done, and per¬haps more,,had not Percy interfered in his behalf.At this alteration the poor batcher was terrified.The Justice then addressed himself to the Es¬quire, and begged his pardon for using, him insuch a manner, imputing it to his not knowinghis quality. The Esquire, with a smile, replied13lothat he must also beg his pardon lor throwinghim and his chair over. The Justice answered.,there was no offenee.Thus we may see the misery of wanting momey. The butcher’could certainly have punishedPercy for killing his dog in such an unprovokedmanner, and would have obtained it, had not theJustice discovered Percy’s family, and let Jus*-«tice wink rather' than offend the brother of a fav¬ourite of his Majesty’s. The poor butcher mustpot only content himself>with the loss of his dog,out be glad he escaped so well. It is just so,generally speaking, in every state of life; if anan be ever so virtuous and of the best princi-oles, if he wants that principle, money, he wants|very thing, and is looked upon as a mean piti¬ful fellow : on the contrary, if a man-be possessed>f thatj he has every thing, though otherwise ofe most consummate ignorance, debauched life,pd insignificant conversation.I confess, if we look backward into the betterd wiser ages of the world, virtue, thoughoathed in rags, was more esteemed than theappings of the gold ass; it is in these last andorst of days that vice has got such an ascen-,nt in the world, as to make men think all thatpoor are miserable; for in tire primitiveernes, poverty was the badge of religion and14piety; and weil it might, for not many great,nor many noble were called; and the study ofwisdom, and contempt of the world was then inesteem among the wisest philosophers in theearliest ages. But as Ovid, saysThe times are chang’d, and even weSeem changed with times to be.So that in those times, considering the miseryof wanting money is so great, we may say withthe wise man, “ My son, it is better to die thanto be poor t” which saying was perhaps the oc¬casion of an old miser’s mistake, who bid his sonobserve what Solomon said, “ Always keep apenny in your pocket.” But his son answeredagain, he did not remember that Solomon saidany such thing. The miser replied, then Solo¬mon was not so wise as I took him to be.Indeed money’s now become the worldly man’sgod, and the card which the devil turns uptrumph to win the game t for it gives birth,breeding, beauty, honour, and credit t and makesthe possessors think themselves wise, thoughtheir very thinking so, declares them fools. Butbecause money answers all things, and is in suchvogue with the world, therefore many are sowilling to purchase it though with the loss ofsoul and body.But the want of money does not only causei:n to be condemned and ridiculed, but it alsoits men upon taking wicked and unlawfuloirses to obtain it: which made one say.O wretched poverty !.' a tool thou’rt made,j .To every evil act and wicked trade.,ir it wresteth and maketh crooked the best na-•es; which are forced by their necessities, toit those things which they blush to think ofWile they are doing them; such as borrowing,sip not being able to pay, tO' speak untruths tower and disguise their poverty; to deceive andetimes to cheat their nearest relations; andbecause, when they are in want, they areirned, and despised, and perhaps disowned byrm.ut before I leave this subject, of shewing theery of wanting money, it is necessary I should;something of the misery of borrowing money,running in debt, which is a consequent ofting moneyfor he that does not want, hasoccasion to borrow, and is in that respectrjjpy ; for being out of debt he is out of danger,,dll therefore needs not seek for by-ways to avoidi|:j creditors, but can walk in the open streetsv.jhout fear, and whet his knife even at the gatest he prison.iput on the contrary, he that borrows money,it made himself such a slave to his creditors,16that he dares hardly say his head is his own, amis afraid that every one he meet is a serjeant oa bailiff, that intends to captivate his outwartabernacle ; like the man that in the night-timehaving his coat catched by a nail, and so stopped, he presently cried out, “ At whose suit !Supposing it was a serjeant that had arrested hireThe causes of Men wanting Money. 1Since money is a thing so necessary and scuseful, and the want of a competency of it, makesa man so very miserable, rendering him liable toall the scorn and contempt that an ill-naturedworld can throw upon him; it seems strange somany should want it, especially those that knowthe worth of it. And therefore it may be worthour enquiring into the causes from whence thiswant proceeds: I mean the common and ordin¬ary causes ; for there are some causes that areextraordinary, such as all our wit and prudencecan neither foresee nor avoid. Such was thatextraordinary and surprising storm in November1703, whereby many thousands were undone, asto their estates,.besides the many lives that wtrelost; and such also was the dreadful fire in Lon-17:i, whereby some that had great estates ther 3 week, had scarce bread to eat the next; andthe time of war many are unavoidably losers,it these must not be reckoned the common( 1 ordinary ways that make and keep men poor.;; know indeed, that by the divine providence,Ei the body of a common-wealth there must ber h poor and rich, even as an'human body can-gjj subsist without hands and feet to labour, and\ ik about to provide for the other members; sooi rich being the belly, which devour all, yet doatpart of the work ; but the cause of every man’ssterty is not one and the same; some are poorhiocondition and content with their calling, andtether seek nor can work themselves into betterdldition; yet God raised up, as by a miracle,children and posterity of these, oftentimes,ossess the most eminent places either inrch or common-wealth, as to become Arch-jjiops, Bishops, Judges, Commanders-generale field, Secretaries of State, Statesmen,, andike; so that it proveth not always true whichpoet says,poor thou art, then poor thou shait remain ;ch men alone do now rich gifts obtain.'dthis condition are the greatest number in everylalgdom; others there are, who have possessedeiit estates, but these estates have not thriven18or continued, being-gotten by oppression, deceitusury, and the like, which commonly lasteth noto the third generation, according to the poet,It seldom is the grandchild’s lot,To be the heir of goods not justly got. ,Others come to want and misery, by spendingtheir fair estates in ways of vicious living, as ob|drink and women ; for Bacchus and Venus are iniseperable companions; and he that is familiawith the one, is never a stranger to the other.In same way, manner, and end,Both wine and women do offend.Some again live in perpetual want, being natu¬rally wholly given to idleness. These are thedrones of a common-wealth, who deserve not tolive. “ He that laboureth not, should not eatLabour night and day, rather than be burthensome,” saith the Apostle Paul: both country anccity swarm with this kind of people; “ The dili¬gent hand,” saith Solomon, “ shall make rich;but the sluggard shall have a scarcity of bread.”I remember when I was in the Low Countries,there were three soldiers, a Dutch-man, a Scot,and an Englishman, who, for their misdemeanors,were condemned to be hanged; yet their liveswere begged by three several men, one a brick¬layer, that he might help him to make bricks, andcarry them to the wails; the other was a brewer19-jf Delft, who begged his man to fetch wate/, anddo other work in the brew-house! and the thirdby a gardener, to help him to work in and dressa hop garden. The first two accepted their offersthankfully ; but the last, the Englishman, told his[naster in plain terms, his friends had never broug htdm up to gather hops : and therefore desired rath-r to be hanged.Others have had great estates left unto themby their friends, and who never knew the painand care of getting them, have as one said truly,I galloped through them in a very short time;these are such as Solomon speaketh of “ who hav¬ing riches have no hearts, or rather the wit, touse them.” These men are most aptly comparedto the willow-tree, because the palms of the wil-x low-tree are no sooner ripe, but blown away withi the wind.I remember to have heard of a wealthy citizen!i*of London, in Queen Elizabeth’s time, who leftI his son a great sum of money, who imagined het should never be able to spend it ; would usuallymake ducks and drakes in the Thames with shil¬lings, as boys were wont to do with tile sheardsand oyster shells; and at the end came to suchextreme want, that he was under the necessityof borrowing sixpence, having many times more20shoes than feet, and sometimes more feet thanshoes, as the beggar said in the comedy.Many also there are, who having been born toa good estate, have quite undone themselves bymarriage, and that after a twofold manner ; first,'by matching themselves without advice of parentsor friends, in heat of youth, unto proud, foolish,and light women, that one would better live onsmall t allowance at a distance, than have a fullmeal at home, where he is always troubled withher never ceasing tongue. And this is the reasonso many husbands travel beyond seas; or at homego from town to town, or from tavern to tavern,'to look for company ! and in a word, to spend anything, to live any where, save at home, in theirown houses, where they are sure to hear nothingbut the brawlings of a scolding woman.DIRECTIONSHow persons may supply themselves with Moneyat all times.N O W, if you would ask me what course youshould take, or what you should do that wantethmoney ; let him first bethink himself to what pro¬fession or trade he hath been formerly broughtup to.

And yet this is done by those thataid take it ill to be charged therewith : as forlance, how many are there that spend a greatof their time in Coffee-houses and Weekly-s mbs ! where, tho’ but little money is pretendedM|e spent, yet a great deal of precious time isaqandered away and lost! which many that fre-3nt these places never think of, but measureo r expenses only by what goes out of theirtweets, not considering what they might have»\ed in the time by their labour, and what theynf ht have saved by keeping at their shops,et us therefore reckon, when a tradesmanto the Coffee-house or Ale-house to take aaiming draught, (let it be of what liquor hefjs,) while he is spending his twopence, smok-22ing and talking, he losses at least an hour of bjtime; and in the evening he goes to his two-pe;ny club, and there tarries from six till te:Now, it must be a very poor trade, if in thitime he could not have earned a shilling. Anif he keeps servants, the want of his presence .home may have occasioned his losing as much the could have gained himself; so that his spending a groat morning and night, (which is twopence each time) cannot be accounted less thathe loss of 2s 8d a-day, which comes to 14s iweek, and £36 : 10s a-year, which sum if saveduntil his eldest son arrived at 21 years of agfand so fit for marriage, and to set up in trad*would have amounted to £750 : 10s. They whwould live so as not to want money, must avoiiall such idle and needless expenses, and unnecessary loss of time.But if the person complaining of the want cmoney, has been brought up to no trade, then lehim consider to what kind of life his genius o:natural disposition does most of all incline himIf he cannot find employment in his own country to suit his genius, (which can scarcely he supposed in a country such as Great Britain, wherarts and science are carried to the greatest penfection, and where a person of any genius, or clittle genius, may find employment) let him seel23: i his fortune abroad. He may at once satisfy his.11 curiosity, supply his necessity, and serve hisucountry, by going into the army or navy, and: thereby have an oppoitunity of doing brave ac-i itions in the service of his country abroad, and. i there he may come to advantage both his fortunei land family If he inclines not the employmentlof the army or navy, he may find something to. i|suit him in our Plantations in the East and WestIndies or in America, in all which places manyman hath done well, who could do nothing atome. Thus you shall find great contentmentAO your conscience to be in action, which Godicicommands us all to be. *The times in no age was so hard as to denybiudustry and ingenuity a livelihood: and, in aord, rather to be in misery for want of money,et a man undertake any vocation and labour, andNever think the labour coarseThat puts a penny in the purse.The want of money is a great torment, andften puts men on unlawful shifts to procure it;herefore let every one who has got money, beareful to know its worth: for since we are borne must live, and it is hard to live upon a smallisjfehare of it. And to conclude this chapter, let usj be always careful to get, and cautious in spend-i cv g money ; and when you have it, know how to24keep and how to use it, when there is occasion;for money in your pocket is the best companion.As one observed, “ be a good husband, and thouwilt soon get a penny to spend, a penny to lend,and a penny for thy friend.” For I would havenone to be such misers as to gain money only tokeep, and not make use of it; for to such, moneyis the greatest curse, of which the world has beenfurnished with many instances.Gain a penny, spend a. penny,(Says the frugal man ;)

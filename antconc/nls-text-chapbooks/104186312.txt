The eoin-plifhy commonly assembled at three o’clock,,and went away about six, unless it was in.31wintertime, when the fashionable hourswere a little earlier, that the ladies mightj;et home before dark. I do not find thati;hey ever treated their company to icedipreams, jellies, or syllabubs \ or regaledhem with musty almonds, mouldy raisins,>r sour oranges, as is often done in the>resent age of refinement. Our ancestorswere fond of more sturdy, substansial tare. »The tea table was crowned with a hugewar then dish, well stored with slices of fat)ork, fried brown, cut up in morsels, andvwimmiog in gravy. The company beingeated around the genial board, and each:i urnished with a fork,, evinced their dex¬terity in launching at the fattest pieces inhis mighty dish, in much the same rnan-'ier as sailors harpoon porpoises at sea, orour Indians spear salmon in the lakes,(feometimes the table was graced with im-nence apple pies, or saucers full of pre¬served peaches and pears ; but it was alwayssure to boast an enormous dish of balls ofnveetned dough, fried iu hog’s fat, andballed dough.nuts, oroly koeks : a delicious:ind of cake, at present scarce known inibis city, excepting in genuine Dutchamilies.The tea was served out of a majestic4flelft ten-pot, oynapiented with paintings offat little Dutch shepherds and shephcrdess.estending pig?—with boats sailing in the air,and houses built in the clouds, and sundryother ingenious Dutch fantasies. Thebeanx distingushed themselves by theiradroitness in replenishing this pot, from ahuge copper tea-kettle, which would havemade the pigmy macaronies of these de¬generate days sweat, merely to look at it.To sweeten the bevrage, a lump cf sugarwas laid beside each cup—and Ihe com¬pany, alternately nibbled and sippeii withthe greatest decorom, until an improvementAvas.introduced by a shrewd and econimicold lady,which was, to suspend a large lumpdirectly over the tea table, by a string fromthe ceiling, so that it could be swung frommouth to mouth,—an ingenious expedient,which is still kept up by some families inAlbany ; but which prevails without ex¬ception in Gommunipaw, Bergen, Flat-Bush, and all our uncontaminated Dutchvillages.At these primitive tea parties the utmostpropriety and dignity of deportment pre¬vailed. ISo flirting nor coqueting-—nogamboling of old ladies, nor hoyden, chat¬tering and romping of young ones—no13sdi-satisfied str.ultings ,of wealthy gentle¬men, with their brains in their pockets;nor amusing conceits, andmonky divertiso-menta of smart young gentlemen with nobrains at all. On the contrary, the youngladies- seated themselves demuvly in theirrush bottomed chairs, and knit their ownr woollen stockings ; nor ever opened theira lips, excepting to say yah Mynheer or' yah ya Vronw, to any question that wasj asked them ; behaving in all things, like,I decent well educated damsels. As to thei gentlemen, each of them tranquilly smokedhis pipe, and seemed lost in contemplationl:| of the blue and white tiles, with which the|| fire places were decorated ; wherin sundryj passages of Scripture were piously peur-!l trayed : Tobet and his dog figured to great| advantage,; Hainan swung conspicuously1 on his gibbet; and Jonah appeared mostj| manfully bouncing out of the whale, likeHarlequin through a barrel of fire.The parties broke up without noise andf without, confusion. They were carriedi home by their own carriages, that is to say,| by the vehicles nature, had provided them,ij except such of the wealthy as could affordj] te keep a waggon. The gentlemen gal*|! lantly attended their fair ones to their res-npoctive abodes, and took leave of them witha hearty smack at the door: which, as iS’was an established piece of etiquette, donein perfect simplicity and honesty of heart,occasioned no scandal at that tkne, norshould’it at tlu? present— if oar-great grand¬fathers approved of the custom, it wouldargue a great want of reverence in theirdescendants to sav a word against it.ICHABOD CRANE.In this by place of nature there alx'de,in a remote period of American history,that is to say, some thirty years since, aworthy wight of the name of IchabodCrane ; who sojourned, or, as he ex pressedit, “tarried,~ in Sleepy Hollow tor thepurpose of instructing the children of thevicinity. He wa a native of~Connecticut:a state which sirplies the Union with pion¬eers for the mind as well as for the forestand sends forth yearly its Legons of fron¬tier woodmen and country schoolmasters-The cognomen of of Crane was not in¬applicable to his person. He was tall but15exceedingly lank, with narrow shoulder?*long arms and legs, hands that dangled amile out of his sieves, feet that might haveserved for shovels, and his whole framemost loosely hung together. His headwas small and flat at top, with huge cai-s*large green glassy eyes, and a long snipenose, so that it looked like a weathercock,perched upon his spintUe neck, to tell,which w'ay the wind blew. To see himstriding along the profile of a hill cn awindy day, with his clothes bagging andIjl fluttering abeedhim, one might have mis¬taken him for the genius of famine des-i cending upon the earth, or some scarecrowi eloped from a cornfieldsHis school-room wuis a low building ofi of one large room, rudely constructed offi logs; the windows partly glazed, andi partly patched with leaves of old copyI books. It was most ingeniously seemedi at vacant hours, by a withe twisted in the1 handle of the door, and stakes set againstI the window shutters; so< that though aJ thief might get in with perfect case, hewould find some embarrassment in gettingout; an idea most probably borrowed by! the architect, Yost Van Houten^ fromI the mystiy of an eel-pot.. The school;*-10house stood in a rather lonely but pleosan,situation* just at the foot of a woody hillwith brook running close by, and a for¬midable birch tree growing at one end ofit. From hence the low murmur of hispupil’s voices, conning over their lessons,might be heard in a drousy summer’s day,like the hum of a bee-hive ; interruptednow and then by the authoritative voiceof the master, in the the tone of menaceor command ; ov, peradventure, by the ap¬palling sound of the birch, as he urgedsome tardy loiterer along the. flowery pathof knowledge. Truth to say, he was a con¬scientious man, that ever bore in mindt he golden maxim, “Spare the road andthe child.”—Ichabod Crane’s scholars cer¬tainly were not spoiled.I would not have it imagined, howeverthat he was one of these cruel potentatesof the school, uiio joy in the smart of theirsubjects ; on the contrary he administredjustice witn discrimination lather than se¬verity; taking the burthen off backs of the•weak and laying it on those of the strong.Your mere puny stripling, that wiuced atthe least flourish of the rod, was parsed Infwith indulgence ; but the claims of justicewere satisfied, byinflicting a double portion17on some little, tougl), wrong-headed broad-skirted, Dutch urchin, who skulked, aridswelled, and grew dogged, and sullen,beneath the birch. All this he called “doinghis duty by their parents and he neverinflicted u chastisement, without followingit by the assurance, so consolatory to thesmarting urchin,that “he would rcinembirit and thank him for it the longest day hehad to live.”When school hours were over he waseven the companion ato'd playmate of thelarger \>ys ; and on holiday afternoons'would convoy some of the smaller oneshon e, who happened so havepretty sisters,or good housewives: for mothers, noted forthe comforts of the 'cupboard. Indeed itbehoved him to keep on good terms withhis pupils. The revenue arrising frofn hisschool was small, and would have beenscarcely sufficient to furnish him withdaily bread, for he was a huge feeder, andthough lank had the dilating powers of anAnaconda;huttohelp outhis maintenance,he was, according to the country customin those parts, boarded and lodged at thehouses of the farmers, whose children heinsti acted, with these he lived successivelya week at a time ; thus gob g toe roundsISof the neighbourhood, with all his worldlyeffects tied up in a cotton handkerchief.^That all this might not be too onerouson the purses of his rustic patrons, whoarc apt to consider the costs of schoolinga grevious burden, ami shoolmasters a&i.mere drones, be bad various ways of ren4dering himself both useful and agreeable.]He assisted the farmers occasionally infthe lighter labours of their farms; helpedto make hay ; mended the fences ; took•the horses to water ; drove the cows frompasture ; and cut wood for the winter fire.He laid asside too all the domi.* snt dignityand absolute sway with which he lordedit in his little empire, the school, and be¬came wonderful gentile and ingratiating.He found favour in the eyes of the .mothers,by petting the children, partieuarly theyoungest; and like the lion hold, which,whilom so magnimously the lamb did holdnhe would sit with a child on one knee,,and rock a cradle for whole hours together.In addition to his other vocations, hewas the siniging master of the neighbour¬hood, and picked up many luright shillingsshy ins,trusting the youngfolks in psalmody.;It was a matter of no little vanity to himi.on Sundays, to take his station in, front oftfesprjatr19the ehurch gallarry, with a hand of chosensingers ; where, in his own mind, he .com¬pletely carried away the palm from the 'parson. Certain it is, his voice resound¬ed far above,all the rest of the congre¬gation ; and there are pcoulier.quivers .stillto he heard in that.church, and may stillbe heard half a niile oif, quite to the op¬posite side.of the mill-pond, on a stillSunday morning, which are said to belegitimately descended from the nose ofJehybod Crane. Time .by divers littlemakeshifts, in that ingenious way whichis commonly denominated “by hook andhy ,crook,” the worthy pedagogue, got ontolerably.enough, and was thought by allwho understood nothing of the labour ofhead-work, to have a wonderful easy life#of it.Superstition.But.all these were nothing to the tales etfghosts and apparitions that suceeded. Theneighbourhood is rich in legendary treasu¬res of the kind. Local tales and superstitionsthrive best in these sheltered long settled.retreats ; but are trampled under foot hyddxe shifting throng that forms the pojmt*•20ation of most of our country places. Be¬sides there is no encouragement for ghostsin most of our villiages, for they have iscarcely had time to finish their first nap,and turn themselves in their graves,before their surviving friends have travel¬led away from the neighbourhood ; so thatwhen they turn out at night to wa& their ;rounds, they have no acquaintance left to •call upon. This is perhaps the reasonwhy we so seldom hear of ghosts except fin our lorigestablished Dutchcommunities.The immediate cause, however, of theprevalence of supernatural stories in theseparts, was doubtless owing to the vicinity I .of Sleepy Hollow. There was a contagionin the very air that blew from that]haunted reigon ; it breathed forth an at¬mosphere of dreams and fancies infectingall the land. Several of the Sleepy Hol¬low people were present at Van - Tassal’s,and, as usual, wore doling out their wildand wonderful legends. Many dismal talcswere told about funeral trains, and mourn¬ing cries arid wailings heard and seen a-bout the great tree where the unfortunateMajor Andre was taken, and which stood Iin the neighbourhood. Some mentionwas made also of the woman in white,t.21that haunted the dark glen at Raven Rock,and was often heard to shriek on winternights before a storm, having perishedthere in the snow. The chief part of thestories, however turned upon the favoritespectre of Sleepy Hollow, the headlesshorseman, who had been heard severaltimes of late, patroling the Country ; and,it was said, tethered his horse nightly a-mong the graves in the Churchyard.The sequestrated situation of this churchseems always to haVn made it a favouritehaunt of trouled spirits. It stands on aknoll, surrounded by locust trees and loftyelms, from among which its decent white¬washed walls shine modestly forth, likeChristian purity, beaming through theshades of retirement. A geritle slope de¬scends frpm it to a silver sheet of water,bordered by high trees, between which,peeps may be caught at the blue hills ofthe Hudson. To look upon its grass-grownyard, where the sunbeams seem to sleepso quietly, one would think that there atleast the dead might rest in peace. Onone side of the church extends a widewoody dell, along which raves a largebrook among broken rocks and trunks ofalien Rees. Over a deep black part ofIthe stream, not far from the church, was, fformerly thrown a wooden bridge; theloud that laid to it, and the bride itself, ,were thickly shaded by overhanging treeswhich cast a gloom about it, even in the ,the day-time; butoccasioneda fearful dark¬ness at night. Such was one of the fav¬ourite haunts of the headless horseman,and the j»]a«e where he was most frequentlyencountered. The tale was told of oldBrouwer, a most heretical disbeliver inghosts, how he met the horseman return¬ing from his forry into Sleepy Hollow, andwas obliged to get up behind him; how ,they galloped over bush and brake, overhill and swamp, until they reached thebridge ; when the horseman suddenly turn¬ed into a'skeleton, threw old Brouwer intothe brook, and sprang away over the treetops with with a clap of thunder.I inFRENCHMEN.In my mind there is no position more jpositive and unexceptonable than that 1most Frenchmen, dead or alive, are |born dancers. I came pounce uponthis discovery at the assembly, and I In>findiately noted it down in my register ofindisputeable facts—-the public shall knowall about it. As I never dance cotillions,holding them to be monstrous distorters of1 the human frame, and tantamount in theiri operations to being broken and dislocated onthe wheel, 1 generally take occasion, whilei they are going on, to make my remarksi on the company. In the course of thesej observations I was struck with the energy- and eloquance of sundry limbs, whichi: seemed to be flurishing about without ap-i; pertaining to any body. After much in-hi vestigation and difficulty, I, at length, tra¬il ced them to their respective owners, whomI found to be all Frenchmen to a man.,i Art may have meddled somewhat in theseLuffairs, but nature certainly did more. I(have since been considerably employed inin calculations on this subject; and by theumost accurate computation I have deter-nmined, that a Frenchman passes at leastilthree fifths of his time between the heavensand the earth, and partakes eminently oflithe nature of a gossam or soap bubble.iQne cf these jack-a-lantren heroes, in tak-% log a figure, which neither Euclid norii! (Pythagoras himself could demonstrateunfortunately wound himself—I mean his 'foot—his better part—into alady’s cobwebmuslin robe; but preceiving it at the in¬stant, he set himself a spinning the otherway, like a top, unravelled his step, with- jout omiting one angle or curve, and extri¬cated himself without breaking one threadof the lady’s dress! he then sprung up like ja sturgeon, crossed his feet four times, and ]finished this wonderful evolution by quiver-1ing his left leg, as a cat does her paw,when she has accidentally dipped it inwater. No man “of woman born,” whoAvas not a Frenchman, or a mountebank,could have done the like.

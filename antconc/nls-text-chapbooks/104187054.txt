He there¬fore accoft? him in their canting method,which is a fort of fpeech, or rather agibberifh peculiar to themfelves. Mon¬ford being ignorant, could make himno direft anfwer; which the other,vvhofe name was Snap, perceiving, andthereby knowing him to be a youngbeginner,-invited him to their feafts, or( 8 )rendezvous in White-chapel, whitherhe having promifed to come, and theybetween them tripp’d off four-black potsof hum, they parted that time.CHAT IV.Hew Monford went to the Beggar’s Feaftrand of his Entertainment ;r-as a!fo~ the Fre*fents they made.MONFORD upon his coming home ,declared to his wife what a mer¬ry companion he met with, and what. difeourie he had, and likewife what hehad promifed, entreating her to getthings in a readinefs, that flie mightconduct him thither j where appeared,inftead of a ragged regiment of lame,blind and dumb, there was a rout ofjovial dancers, as gay as the fpring, andoff ttierrj ns the maids; which madethem imagine they were miftaken inthe place, or was impofed upon ; andtherefore turned to go away, had notSnap ftarted from his chair, wrhere hefat as fupervifor in all his gallantry, andtaking him by the hand, let him knowwho it was that introducea him into theafiembly, where he was received brother( 9 >of t?ie!r fociety, e^cry member faliitinghim with a compliment: and that hemight- not want a guide for the future,Snap, in the name of the fociety, pre-fcnted him with a dog and a bell, train¬ed^ to the bufinefs: lo his wife and hebeing fplcndidly entertained, were dif-nit {Ted upon his promise, that he wouldrot be abfent at their yearly meeting.CHAP V.What Succefs he hod in the Icggiug Trade1;how his Wife war brought to Med of aDaughter, anxlchrif.encd by the flame ofElizabeth.HpHE blind beggar foon became maf-| ter of his trade, and by the helpof his dog, trudg’d often to London 5and having the perfect tone, had theluck to return with his pockets wellhned with chink ; Id's way of beggingbecame fo pleafmg to him, that heWould often fing as follows:r ' sA bfggar lives a merry life.And has both wealth and cafe ;Itis days are free from care and ftn’fe,He does whate’er he pleafe.( i O )While others labour, fweat, and toil,His tongue does get him pelf;He travels with his dog and bell,And brings home ftore of wealth.He being by this time in a warmcondition, to add further to his joy,his loving uif'e fell in labour, and wasdelivered of a daughter, whole birthmade him think he was the hap pie ftman alive. An hundred times he kifledher, and dandled her in his arms, whomhe Chriftened by the name ofEUaatseth,•and as ihe increafed in years, fo herbeauty and modeiiy caufed her to becalled pretty Betty : Some began to doteupon her admirable perfection, and thebetter to qualify her, gave her factalearning as was fuitable to her degree,which the improved ; frs that her beau¬ty and wit, her ikill in finging, dancing,and playing upon inftrurnents of mufic,procured her the envy of the youngmaidens thereabouts; who fuppofe.dthemfelves much fuperior in birth andfsrfune, would often refteft upon herbirth, and call her a beggar’s brate.

The good woman being more andmore taken with her carriage, demand¬ed if Hie would be content to ftay withher till fhe could better provide to heradvantage, and that Hie would ufe heras a daughter, rather than a fervant;Betty thanxfuliy accepted the offer, andin the perfovmance* of whatever fheundertook, difebarged herfelf fo we//( i3 )thaJ. £he gained the love and applaufeof all that obferved her, irrfumuen thather name for beauty and ingenuity be¬gan to fpread, and abundance of youngmen reforted to the houfe, which crea¬ted great trade* on purpofe to feeher, who generally took a liking toher j for nature had made her fo lovelyand charming that fhe could not but beadmired, infomueh that many of them,aa they found opportunity, began tobuz love florit'9 in her ears, to which ^hegave but little heed, till four^ fuitors ofgreater worth beat off thefe little aflail-ants, and laid clofe fiege, as in the follow--ing chapter will appear.CHAP.

But fhe modeftly declined his of¬fers, as alfo the offers of all. bet otherfuitors, by reprefenting to them the in-( *4 )equality of her fortune to theirs; butthis lerved only to increafe their paf-fions. And being every day impor¬tuned, ihe at laft refolved to difeoverwho her parents were, judging that wayto be the moil fure means to try the lin-cerity of their love and affeefion, whichthey pretended to have for her.CHAP. Vill.How pretty Betty being wooed By her Mafler'sSon, a Merchant* a Gentlemnt and aKnight; how upon her (heinring her lJa>rentage* was /lighted by all but the Knight;and of their Agreement.OUR beautiful virgin being hardlypreffed for love and enjoyment,found herfelf obliged to take a courfathat might rid her of her lovers, or al¬lot one of them to her (hare ; whereforefhe told them ihe was not-really at herown 'difpofu, her parents being alive,therefore if they loved her, as theyfind, and feeing but one could enjoyher, hie-was contented her father ihouldehoofe one for her, of whole choice ihewould approve.This fee them aloioft at daggers draw-( 15 )ing, who fhould get thither firft, butwhither to go they knew not, thereforedeiired to be informed, every one’sheart being filled with joy, not doubtingto carry the prize j when thus fire be¬gan :“ My parents, worthy firs, live onBethnal-green *, my father is left witha dog and a bell, living upon the cha¬rity of good people, and my mother, apoor woman that fpins for bread. Thus1 have declared to you my parents, andthough I might have the richeft perfbnin the wgfld for a hufbaud, yet I wouldnot marry him without their confents,which 1 think myfeif bound in duty toobtain,”Mod of her fuiters feemed thunder-ftruck at this plain declaration, everyone, except the knight, defpifing her,now’ as-much as they leemed to love herbefore, each of them fwearing theyv.-ouid not undervalue tnemfelves tomarry a beggar’s child. But tb£ knightwas more inflamed than ever, and hav¬ing a large eftare, did not regard intereflor a portion fo much as he did the p!ea-fing of his fancy with a beautiful, mo-deft, young, and virtuous maid, allwhich centered in pretty Betty.

Their hurry and con-fufion was great, and the townfmengoing a nearer away, overtook and fellfoul upon the kaight and his fervants,without giving him leave to fpeak forhimfelf, or fuffering his miftreft to ex-i eufe him, fo that a fliarp conflict en*, C is )fued ; till at length divers perfons thatwere travelling the road came in andparted them, whereby they came to aright undeidlanding; which made thofethat had mifuled him beg' his pardon,which he granted, and difmifling thehn, -kept on his way till coming to the oldman's door they alighted ; which madehim, upon hearing the node of. horfcstrampling, being a thing very unufuai,ilart from the fire and put his head outof the window, and not underdandingthe meaning of it, ere the knight's un¬cle came puffing and blowing at aOrange rate, crying, why, how now, tie- •phew ?

Both parties beingready, they rained a golden Hiower fo( 20 )plentifully, that the gentleman's flockfailed him, and the beggar not hearingit chink, fell into laughter, and faid,“ How, fir, is your money done fofoon ? I thought at £rft you had morewords than money j pray, for yourcredit’s fake, try your friends, for Ihave three or four cat fkins, with gold¬en puddings in their bellies yet.” In¬deed, faid the gentleman, I am contentto own you have out-done me, andthink you have the philofopbef’s ftone,or keep a familar to bring it to youfrom the golden mountain : but feeingthe world goes fo well with you I fliahno further go about to perfuade myfon in law, but beg pardon for what Lhave done.

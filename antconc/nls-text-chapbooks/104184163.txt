O ! ’ say Donald, 'spare my life,For sake o’ my poor weans and wife.Ha’e there’s the cash but wi’ what shameAnd grief, must I face friends at hame !They’ll not believe a word o’t either !Lord help’s, I’m ruined a’thegither !’‘Stop,’ says the fellow ‘ cease your crying,Your friends will not suspect you lying;i5They will believe what you say to them,From evidence that you shall gi’e them.From every one I rob, I’ve credit.By giving me his hand I did it;My comrades and I together,This token give to one another.So, one of your hands must go with me,Come, take your choice, which shall it be ?‘ My dog is gane, and darling purse ;And now my hand ! still worse and worse.Ha’e mercy on me,’ Donald prays,‘ I’ll be a beggar a’ my days.’‘ No mercy for you, cried the wretch,‘ Come, down with it, I’ll make quickdespatch. ’‘ Weel, wee!,’ says Donald ‘ I submit ;But ae request grant, if it’s fit,That is, since my lelt hand must go,Driv’t aff at ae most desperate blow,No on the saft green, there, perhaps,Ye’ll pine me sair, by several chaps ;But ye’ll at ance, maire siccer do’t,On yonder smooth tree’s spreading root.’Poor Donald’s prayer was heard ; he thenMade bare his left hand shackle bane,And on the tree toot laid it quaking,The robber now his aim was taking,Wi’ baith hands rais’d the vengeful whittle,And as he struck wi’ awfu’ ettleSly Donald slipt his arm ajee ;And firm the sword stack in the tree.‘ Ha’e at you now, ye cruel wretch ! ’Quo Donald, ‘ I am now your match.’Wi’ that he seized him by the collar.Gie’d him a jerk that gart him gollar,His Highland blood boiled in a passion ;He gie’d his face a horrid bashin’ ;Syne drew his cravat round so tight,That hailh, he strangled him maist out right.By these means, Donald man’d to mak’,His hands secure ahind his back.Syne on the beast he put the billy,Wi’s feet tied underneath its belly.The dog whilk Donald mourned fu’ sair.i6A frightfu’ sight o’ reeking gore;He on ahind the fallow, placed,Across the hurdies o’ the beast.Syne Donald’s triumph to evince !He mounts his beast as prouds’ a prince,Brandish’d the sword and dar’d the blade,To move his hands, feet, tongue, or head ;That if he did, he warned him now,Up to the hilt he’d run him through.Sae, on the road they trudged alang,And Donald crooned a Highland sang.They reached the town, folks were surprised,The robber soon was recognised ;The magistrates there, brawly kent him,For mair than ance he’d been foment them.For mony years, his deeds o’ horrorHad kept baith far and near in terror.For whilk, whae’er would apprehend him,And to the nearest prison send him,Would be entitled to regard,And fifty guineas o’ reward.Whilk Donald got, in word and deed.'7NEW WAY OF RAISING THE WIND ;ORHABBIE SIMPSON AND HIS WIFE.[This highly humorous and truly Scottish productioncelebrates an adventure of the renowned Habbie Simpson,which actually occurred. Habbie appears to have beenrather a privileged character, for besides being the bestpiper in the west country, he was possessed of manyeccentricities, the oddity and originality of which alwaysrendered him a welcome and amusing companion. Thathe was regarded as no common character may be inferredfrom the fact that a statue of him, pipes and all, waserected in a prominent niche of the steeple of Kilbarchan,his native village, where it yet stands a very significanttestimony of the esteem in which he was held. ]I pit nae doubt but ye’ve a’ heard tell o’ HabbieSimpon, the piper o’ Kilbarchan ; but I’m no thinking yeever heard the story that I’m gaun to tell ye aboot himand his wife, Janet. Weel, ye see, it sae happened thatHabbie, like mony mare now-a-days, was geyan fond o’ awee drap o’ the blue, and as the story gangs, sae was hiswife, so that it geyan often happened that when Habbie,yokit the fuddle, Janet she yokit it tae. Noo, it’s an auldsaying, and geyan true ane, tae, that when a cannel islichtit at baith ends, it sune burns dune, and it was saeverified in the present case : for Habbie waukened aemorning after a fuddle, and says to Janet—“ Rise woman,and see if ye can get me half-a-gill, for, oh ! my head islike to split.” “Half-a-gill?” quo Janet, “ Whaur wadI gel it when there’s no a plack in the house ? and as fortakin’nt on, ye ken that’s clean oot o’ the question, so yemaun just lie still and thole the best way you can.” “Oh,Janet,” cries Habbie again, “ You’re no amiss at schem¬ing—is there nae way ava ye can think on to raise thewind!” “I’ll tell ye what I’ll do,” quo’ Janet, “I’llawa to the Laird o’ Johnstone, and I’ll tell him that ye’redeid, and as you’re a great favourite o’ his, I’m sure I’llget something frae him to help tae bury ye.” “ Od, butthat will do grand,” quo’ Habbie. Sae up Janet gets?aand awa to the laird’s house, when, ringing the bell, thedoor was opened by the lady, who, seeing Janet so piti¬ful looking, she says—“ Keep us a’ this day, is thereonything wrang at hame that ye hae come here sae earlyin the morning ? ” “ Wrang,” quo’ Janet, dichtin’ her eenwi’ the tail o’ her apron, “ A’s wrang thegither, my leddy.Isna oor Habbie deid ! ” “ Habbie deid ! ” quo’ the ladyin surprise. “ A-weel-wat is he, my leddy,” quo’Janet,“and a sair trial it is to me, my leddy ; for there’s no somuckle in the house this morning, as would feed a sparrow;and whaur to get onything I’m sure I dinna ken. Oh,dear ! oh, dear ! that ever I should come to this o’t.”“Compose yourself,” quo’ the leddy, “And come yourwa’s ben, and we’se see what can be done.” Sae, ingangs Janet wi’ the lady, and gets a basket wi’ somebiscuits and speerits, and ither articles needfu’ for sic anoccasion ; and thanking the lady for her kindness, comesawa hame to Habbie fu’ blythely, when doon they sat,nor did they rise till they made an end o’ the contents o’the basket. Noo, as the auld sang says, the mair yedrink, the drier ye turn, for they were nae sooner dunethan Habbie says—“ Losh, Janet, that’s real guid ; canye no get some mair o’t?” “ Na, na,” quo’Janet, “Ihae played my turn already ; it’s your turn noo.” “Oh,very weel,” quo’ Habbie, “ If it’s my turn noo, ye maunjist be deid next.” “’Ods, I hae nae objections,” quo’she, “sae awa’ ye gang, and let’s see what ye can do.”Weel, awa’ gangs Habbie, and meeting the laird jistcoming hame frae a hunting party, he says—“ This is afine day laird.” “A fine day, Habby,” quo’ the laird ;“ Hoo’s a wi’ ye ? are ye no coming up to play us a springon the pipes the nicht?” “It wadna look very weel,laird, for me to be playing on the pipes at your house, andmy ain wife lying a corpse at hame.” “ What ! is Janetdeid?” quo’ the laird. “Atweel is she,” quo’ Habbie,“And I’m sure it couldna’ ha’e happened at a waur time,for there’s neither meat nor siller in the house, and hoo toget her decently aneath the yird, I’m sure I dinna ken.”“Dinna vex yoursel’ about that,” quo’ the laird, gi’enhim some money; “There’s a trifle for you.” Habbiethanked the laird for his kindness, bade him guid day,and cam hame geyan weel pleased wi’ what he had gotten,and sends Janet oot wi’ the bottle to get mair whisky tocarry on the spree. In the meantime, hame gangs the9laird, whaur the first thing that he heard was, that HabhieSimpson was deid. “ Na, na,” quo’ he, “ it’s no Habbieits only Janet.” “ It’s Habbie,” quo’ the lady ; “ WasnaJanet here this morning herseP and tell’t me? and didna sheget awa’ some speerits and biscuits, as she said there wasnothing in the house?” “And didna I meet Habbiejust as I was coming hame, when he tell’t me that Janetwas died. But I see hoo it is—they are at their auldtricks again. But come, we’ll awa’ to Habbie’s, and seewhat they’re about.” In the meantime, Habbie andJanet are fuddlin’ in fine style, and lauchin’ heartily atthe way ta’en to raise the wind, when Janet cries—“Guidpreserve us, Habbie, what’s to be dune noo ! I declare ifthat’s no the laird and the leddy, and they’re comingstraucht here ! ” “I dinna ken,” quo’ Habbie, “whatto do unless we are baith deid.” Sae in the bed tinygaed, and they were nae sooner doon, than the laird andlady cam in, and seeing Habbie and Janet in bed, hesays—“Waesme! isna that awfu to see? The man andwife baith deid ! But I’d gi’e five shillings this momentto ken which o’ the twa dee’t first.” The words were naesooner oot o’ his mouth than up jumps Habbie, crying—“ It was me, laird ; noo gie me the five shillings.” It isneedless to add that the laird gaed Habbie the money,and mony a hearty laugh he had when he thought on theway Habbie and his wife had ta’en to Raise the IVind.20THE WEST KINTRA WEAVERTURNED TEETOTALER.[This celebrated Scottish story used to be told by thelate John Drummond, with tremendous applause.]It’s as fack as death, I’m maist burning wi’ shame tobaud up my head before sic a respectable company,particularly as my character, drawn in gey black colours,has been here before me ; but as ye hae heard the first o’t,and I hope the warst o’t, I trust that ye’ll pay attentionto what remains o’ my history, and ye’ll be better able tojudge o’ the story through and through.

So yae nicht, after a hardday’s wark, he meets Will,—“ Hech, Will, there’s a gaycauld kind o a nicht. Hae ye ony objections to a dram?”“ No,” quo’Will, “where willyegang?” “We’ll justgang o’er to Lucy Sourkaill’s.” Weei, they sat down,and they had yae dram after anither, till “the propercorrective that aften parts gude company” gar’d them rise—that’s the bottom o’ loom pouch. “ Hech,” says John,“ I’ll hae to be up before the sparrows, to gie wa’ for acart o’ coals.” Weel he was as glide’s his word ; he wak¬ened frae the side o’ Mrs. Tamson, and yokes the horsegeyan and canny, and he’s no lang till he’s throughCamlachie toll. But, faith, in that quiet o’ the roadbetween Camlachie and Parkhead, John fa’s asleep.But wha the devil should come by, but Bauldy Baird, andhe’s a gay gleg kind o’ a chiel—he disna like to let a gudeopportunity slip out o’ his hands. So he unyoked John’shorse geyan canny, and he sets down the cart as canny.It happened to be Ru’glen Fair morning, and he kent weelwhare he was taking his bargain till ; so he left Johndriving his pigs to the market geyan comfortable. Butas John suddenly fell asleep, he as suddenly wakened,and looking up wi’ his ae e’e half opened, he looks firstto the tae side o’ the cart, and syne to the tither, and hecries, “ Gor, I canna understan’ the meaning o’ this at a’.As the Laird M‘Nab said when he cam’ in at the winningpost at Perth races—‘ By the Lord, this is me now ; ’ butI canna’ exclaim wi’ the Laird M ‘Nab,—for, by my faith,this is no me ! no me !—but there’s yea thing I can see,that if I’m John Tamson, I’ve lost a horse ; but if I’m noJohn Tamson, I’ve found a cart. But how will I findout this? I’ll just awa’ hame to the wife, for she settlesa’ my accounts ; she’ll settle this yin tae.” Weel, awa’hame he comes, geyan briskly, and he’s no lang till he’s23at his ain door ; and he cries out, “ Am I John Tamson?”Mrs. Tamson puts o’er her hand to find for honest John,— “Na, na,” quo’ she, “ye’re no John Tamson, he’sawa’ to his wark twa or three hours syne.” “Od, I’mglad o’ that,” quo’ he, “ for if I had been John Tamson,I would have lost a horse ; but, as I’m no John Tamson,lord, I’ve found a cart ! ”THE PUZZLED DUTCHMAN.Im a proken-hearted Deutscher,Vot’s villed mit crief und shame.I dells you vot der drouble ish :I doesn't kntnu.my name.You dinks dis fery vunny, eh ?Yen you der schtory hear,You vill not vonder den so mooch,It vas so schtrange und queer.My moder had dwo leedle twins ;Dey vas me und mine broder :Ye lookt so fery mooch alice,No von knew vich vrom toder.Von off der poys was “Yawcob,”Und “ Hans” der Oder’s name :But den it made no tifferent,Ye both got called the same.Veil; von of us got tead—Yaw, Mynheer, dat ish so !But vedder Hans or Yawcob,Mine moder she don’d know. ,Und so I am in droubles:I gan’t kit droo mine hed,Vedder I'm Hans vot's lifing.Or Yawcob vot ish tead!.,

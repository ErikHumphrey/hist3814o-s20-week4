THE HISTORY OFJOHN CHEAPThe Chapman.if*Containing Above ahundred merry Exploits doneby Him and his Fellow Traveller, Drouthy Tom,a stipked Shaver.IN THREE PARTS."TT OHN CHEAP the Chapman, was a very comical short thickfellow, with a broad face and a long nose; both fame andlazy, and something leacherous among the lasses: He chused ra¬ther to sit idle than work at any time, as he was a hater of hardlabour. No man needed to offer him cheese and bread after hecurst he would not have it; for he would blush at bread and milk*when hungry, as a beggar doth at a babee. He got the name ofJohn Cheap the Chapman, by his selling twenty needi.s for apenny, and twa leather laces for a fai thing.He swore no oaths but one, which was, let me never sin.He used no imprecations, But let me never cheat nor be cheated, but rather cheat, Ac.He gave bad counsel to none but children, to hum the bonecombs, that their mother might buy another when he came again.He never fought with any but dogs, and the good .wives daugh¬ters in their daffing, and that’s not dangerous.n w f t? nt r* ic •frinud by WILLIAM SCOTT.2 The HISTORY ofP A R T.

Well, says I to my seif, If this be theyiway, I shall begin in the morning to ask for lodging^or any time when I am hungry.

O goodwife, what arc you saying I Do ye r!not mind, when you and I was at the east end of the jhouse, such a noise of wind and water* was then ; a ;wae worth the filthy body, said she, is not that inevery part! What said the goodman, a wat wellthere was nae rain when I came in : the wife thenshoots me out, and bolted the door behind me : Wellsaid I, but I shall be through between thy mouth and ;thy nose or the morrow. It being now so dark, and :I a stranger, could see no pjace to go to, went into ijthe corn yard, but finding no loose straw I fell a iidrawing one of their stacks, sheaf by sheaf, until I 5!pulled out a threave or two, and got into the hole timyself, where I lay as -warm as a pie ; but the good-man in the morning, perceiving the heap of corn ;sheaves, came running to carry it away, and stop up jthe hole in the stack wherein I lay, with some of the [isheaves, so with the steighling of the straw, and him rtalking to others, cursing the thieves who had doneit; swearing they had stole six threaves of it; I thenskipping out of the hole, ho, ho, said I, goodman,you’re not to hury me alive in your stack: he thenbegan to chide me, vowing he would keep my packfor the damage 1 had done : whereupon, I took hisservants witnesses he had robbed me ; when hearing |me urge him so, he gave me my pack again, and off I1 came to the next house, where I told the whole :of the story.John dritfA* tit Chapmtiv: &My next exploit was near Carluke, between Ha-tniirown and JLanerk : Where oh a cold stormy night*I came to a little town with four or five horses in it;I went twice through it, bat none of them wouldgive me credit to stand among their horse, or yet tolet me ly in their cow’s oxter: At last I prevailedwith a wife, her -husband was willing, to let mestay , she would, and sent me to the barn to ask himand I meeting him at the barndoor carrying in straefor his horses; T told him, his wife had grantedto let me stay; if he was not against it, to which heanswered, “ If I should iyin his midden dib, I shouldno quarters from him that night; a wheen lazyidle villans rins a’ to be chapmen, comes thro’ theM country fashing fouks, ay seeking quarters : the“ next day ye 11 be gaun wi’ a powder’d pirrewfg,** and a watch at your arse, and winna let fowk stand« afore your chapdoors, ye’ll be sae saucy.” I hear¬ing thus my sentence from the goodman, expectin~no relief but to ly without, yet I perceived when hecame out of the barn, he only drew too the door b.:hind him : So when he was gone, I slipt into thebarn, and by the help of one of the kippies, climbsup the mou, and there dives down among the sheavesand happed myself all over, sto that I lay as warm asthe goodman himself. But in the morning long be¬fore day, two fellows came into the barn, and fett at meshing, that by their disturbance I could sleep nomore ; at last I got up with all my hair hanging overmy face, and when he that stoed on the opposite sideperceived me, I made my eyes to roll, and wrayedmy face in a frightful manner, so that the poor febousupposed he had seen the d—], or something as ill,gave a roar as if he had been gticked, aud out .at the,ntSo.'runs *, ths other following after him, crying{j;k,;-johnny man, what did you see?

I then came out at the door, and lifted a stonerunning three times round about and threw it over thehouse, muttering some words, whic^i I knew not my¬self, and concluding with these words, “ Thou Mon¬sieur Diable, brother ro Beelzebub godofEkron, takethis wife s Kim, butter and milk, sap and substance,without and within, so that she may die in misery, asshe would have others tolive ”ihe wife hearing the aforesaid sentence, clapt herhands, and called out another old woman as foolishas herself, who came crying after us to come back,back we went, where she made us eat heartily of but¬ter and cheese; then she earnestly pleaded with me?5The HtSTOTtr of:to go and lift my cantrups. which I did, upon her Vpromising never to deny a hungry traveller meat nor ::• drink, whether they had money to pay for’t or not; {and never to serve the poor with the old proverb, ‘ Go uhome to your own parish,’ but give them less or more las ye see them in need. This she faithfully promised hto do while she lived, and with milk, we drank to- <wards her cow’s good health anehher own, not forgetr !ting her husbam/s and the tmll’s, as the one was good- Iman of the house, and the other ot the byre ; and a-*(way we came in all haste, lest some of a more under- istanding nature should come to hear of it, and follow Iafter us.In a few days thereafter we came to an ak-housW!in a muir, far distant from any other, it being a sorenday of wind and rain, we could not travel, wc was o-t:hliged to stay there, and the house being very thro g^iwe could get no bed but the servant-lass’s, which wc\was to have for a penny-worth of pins and needles,and she was to ly with her master and mistress : Buaias we were going to bed, in comes three Highlandtdrovers on their way home frorti England ; the land-jlord told them that the beds were all taken up butonnithat two chapmen was to ly in.; one of them swore rhis broad sword should fail him, if a chapman lawthere that night.

II.*Y^rE a8a‘n came to a near Sutry hill, where» » the ale was good, and very civil usage, and ourdraught being very great, the more we drank, the bet¬ter we lov’d it: and here we fell in company with aquack-doctor, who bragged us with bottle about, fortwo days and two nights, only when one fell drunk,we pushed and pricked him up with a big pin, to keephim from sleeping : he bought of our hair, and we ofhis pills and drugs, he having as much knowledge ofthe one as we had of the other : only I was sure, Ihad as much as would set a whole parish to the mid¬den or mug, all at once: but the profit, tho’ all tocome, went to the landlady to make up her loss ofhaving the lime pish’d off her door-cheeks, and whatwe did not pish, we scyth’d thro’ our teeth, and gavethe dogs the girt bits.But at last our money ran short, and the landladyhad no chain nor faith to credit us, seeing by ourcoats, courage and conduct, that we would little mindperformance against the day of payment; so then wpbegan to turn wise and sober, behind the hand, everyone of us to seek supply from another, and whenwe collected all the money we had amongst us, onthe table, it was fourpence haifpeny, which we lov¬ingly divided among us, but only three babees a pieceand as Drouthy lom’s.stock. and mine was conjunct,10The HISTORT ofwe gave the quack again his sh g stuff and stink-jing mugs, and he gave us our goods and pickles of;h.,ir, wlivh we equaly divided betwixt us, the wholesoi i only came to eighteen shillings and sixpence};prime cost, and so we p rted ; I went lor East Lothi-dan, and Tom for the West \ but my sorting of goods |being very unsuitably for that country, I got but iittleilor no money, which caused me to apply to the good- |man for to get lodging, and it being upon a Saturday’s 'right was hard to be found till late in the night, Iprevailed to get staying in a great farmer's house, a- ibout two miles from Haddington ; they were all at isupper when I went in; I was ordered to sit down lbehind theiv backs, the goodwife then took a dish, iwent found the servants, and collected a soup out ofevery cog, which wras sufficient to have served threemen, the goodw ife ordered me to be laid in the barn, iall night for my bed, but the bully fac’d goodman jswore he had too much stuff in it, to venture me ithere ; the good wife said, i should not ly within the ihouse, for I would be o’er near the lasses bed. then ;the lads swore 1 should not go with them, for I wasa foijc ket like fellow, and (wha kt ns whether I was jhonest or not) lie may fill his wallet wi’ our cioathsand gang his wa’ or daylight. At last I was conduc- pfed out to the swine’s sty to sleep with an old sow and .seven pigs, and there I lay for two nights. Here now rT began to reflect on the spur fruits o! drinking, and f<jwn all the misery just that was come upon me. In 1the night the young pigs came gruzeling about me ve- 1xv kindly, thinking I was some friend of their mo-* L<Uner's come to visit them; they gave me but little rest •.always coming kissing me with their cold noses, that f.caused me to beat them off with my staff, which maderhem to make a terrible noise, so that their oddmother'I • 'llJohn Cheaf the Chapman. ITcame up to argue the matter, running upon me withopen mouth, but I gave her such a rout over her longshout, th.it caused her to tore out murder in her ownlanguage and alarmed the servants where they lay,who came to see what was the matter, 1'told them theirold sow was going to swallow me up alive bid'themto go and bring her meat, which they did, and thebrute became peaceable.On the Sabbath morning. I came into the house,the goodman asked me if I could shave any, yes, saidI> but never did on the Sabbath-day, I fancy, said he:,you are some W estland Whig ? Sir, said I, you maysuppose me to be what you think proper to day, butyesternight you used me like a Tory, when you sentme into a stye to ly in your sow’s oster, which is i fit¬ter companion for a devil than any httman'ereature jthe most abominable brute on the earth, said I, whichwas forbidden’to be eaten under the law and cursedunder the gospel: be they curs’d Cr be they bless’d,fcaid he, I wish I had a-new of them ; but an’ ye will4lot take oxT my beard, ye’sget nae Meat here the daythen, saSd 1, if ye will nor give me ifieitt am! drink formoney Until the Sabbath be past, i’ll take on my wal¬let aml^oilong with you to the kirk and tell yourminister how you used me as a hog ; no said the good-wife; vou shii!l not want yonr crowdie man. But myheart being fuil-of sorrow and revenge, a few of themsufficed me, whereon 1 past over *hat long day, andat night went ro sleep with mv old companions, whichwas not sound being afraid o'f Mrs. Sow’s coming toavenge the quarrel we had the night before.'On the morning 1 went into the house, the good-man ordered me the pottage pot to lick, for, says heit is an old property to chapmen. Well 1 had nosooner begun to it, then cut came a great big mastiff12The HfSTORr ofdog from below the bed, and grips me by the breast*!then turns me over upon my back, and takes the potthimself : ay, ay, said the goodman, 1 think your bronither pot-licker and you cannot agree about your break-f'fast ? A well, said 1, goodman ye said that pot licking^was a chapman’s property, but your dog proves the)contrary : so away 1 comes, and meeting the goodwifeat the door, Lids her farewell forever j but what, said1, is your husband’s name ? to which she answered,John Swine, 1 was thinking so, saidl, he has such dir¬ty fashions j bwt whether was yon his mother or his:sister 1 lay with these two nights.AH that day I travelled the country west fromHaddington, but could get no meat; when I asked!if they had any to sell, they told me, they never didsell any bread, and I found by sad experience, theyhad none to give for nothing. I came into a littlecountry village, and went through it all, house after:house, and could get neither bread nor ale to buy :At last I came into a poor weaver’s house, and aske®him if he would lend me a hammer? Yes, >aid 1 •-*:what are you going to do with it ? Indeed saidI am going to knock out all my teeth with it, for fcan get no bread to buy in this country, for all the!stores and stacks you have in it; What, said he, was*you in the minister’s ? I know not, said I, does hekeep an ale-house ? O na, said he, he preaches everyjSunday; and what does he preach, said I ? is it toharden ypur hearts ? baud tvcll together ? have nocharity? hate strangers ? hunger the poor ? cat anddrink all yourselves? better burst your bellies thengive it to beggars, or let good meat spoil: If youviminister be as naughty as his people, I’m positivehe’ll drive a louse to London for thehyde and tallftw.Here I bought the weaver’s dinner for twopence f]<mK Cuilav the Chnpmafi. ISand then set ©at again, keeping my course westward.It being now night, I came to a farmer’s house southfrom Dalkeith} the goodman being very civil, anddesirous of news, I related the whole passages of thetwo days and nighis by-past •, whereat he was greatsly diverted, and said, i was the first he hard of, thatever that man gave quarters to before, though he wasan elder of. th© parish. So the goodman and I fellso thick, that he ordered me to be laid on a shakdown-bed beyond the fire, where I lay more, snug than a-mong the swine. Now there was three women ly¬ing in a bed in the same apartment, and they notminding that I was there, first one of them rose andlet her water go in below the chimney grate, whereI had a perfect view of her bonny-thing, as the coal-fire burnt so clearly all the night; then another roseand did the same last of all get up the old matron,as she appear’d to be, like a second handed goodwifeor a whirl’d o’er maiden, six times overturned, andas she let her dam go, she also with full force, whendone, let a fart like a blast of a trumpet, which madethe dust on the hearth stone to fly up like mist abouther buttocks, whereat I was forced to laugh out,which made her to run for it, but to smother thelaughter Istapt the blankets in my mouth she wentto bed and waken’d the other two, saying O dole !what will I tell you ? yon chapman body has seen aour a—ses the night -, shame fa him, said they, for*we had nac mind he was there 1 wat well, says oneof them, I’se no rise till he be awa’, but said the oldwoman, gin he has seen mine 1 cannot help it, it’sjust like other fouled, amt fin’t a hair I care. On themorning the old matron got up first and ordered upthe house, then told me to rut now, for chapmenand every body was up j then she asked me if 1 had14iThe BISTORT'of .[an use of uugKing in my sleep ?

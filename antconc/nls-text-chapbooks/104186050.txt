at length to the shore ;Says Dermont to Pat, we the owner will bilk.To-night well be merry and frisk),I know it as well as my own mother’s milk,Dear joy, ’tis a barrel of whisky.Says Pat, I’ll soon broach it, a fortunate lot.Now Pat, you must know was no joker ;III go to Tom Murphy, who lives in the cot,And borrow his kitchen hot poker.T was said and ’twas done, the barrel was bor’d.No bachanals ever felt prouder,<5cn Paddy found out a small error on board,The whisky, alas ! was gunpowder.With sudden explosion he flew o’er the ocean,And high in air sported a leg ;Yet instinct prevails, when philosophy fails.So he kept a tight hold of the keg,But Dermont bawled out with a terrible shout,I’m not to bo choused, Mr Wiseman ;If you do not come down, I'll run into the town.And by St Patrick I’ll tell the Exciseman.THE KING OP THE FAIRIES.A wee, wee man came to our toun en,Fiddledum, faddledum, fee, fee, fee ;An’ he sang sae sweet, that the hale o’ our menLap aff their looms the carle to

back o’ my han’,Fiddledum, faddledum, fee, fee, foe ;An’ his feet wad Jiae covered an acre o’ lau’,Yet his Boots cam’ up o’er the lid o’ his knee.His e’en were grey without ony white,Fiddledum, faddledum, fee, fee, fee ;An’ his teeth were as black as the middle o’ night,When the moon has forsaken this countrie.7His legs were as bow’d as tbe half o’ a hoop,Fiddledum, faddledum, fee, fee, fee ;An’ his arms were sae lang, ho ne’er needit to st^op.For he picked up preens without bending his ktyeoHo laughed, and the hale o’ the men o’ our toun,Fiddledum, faddlcdum, fee, fee, fee ;Lap out o’ their wits and fell down in a swoon,The fient o’ them had the power to flee.I He sang, and they sprang to their feet in a crack,Fiddledum, faddledum, fee, fee, feo ;!i Now what I relate is a notable fact,For I was sleeping when 1 did it sec.i Ho play’d them a jig, and the dancing began,Fiddledum, faddledum, fee, fee, fee;And he led them to where a big water down ran,Where he douked them till they

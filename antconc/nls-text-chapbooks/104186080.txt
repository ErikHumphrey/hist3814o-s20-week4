NEW AND IMPROVED SERIESNo. 8.MEDICAL GUIDECONT AIDINGTREATMENT or the more COMMON DISEASES.By an EXPERIENCED PHYSICIAN.GLASGOW:PRINTED FOR THE BOOKSELLERS.1850.* OF SCOTLAND•^OjN B UTHEMEDICAL GUIDE.The following- pages are intended to suggest safe and•useful hints regarding the more common diseases, and,in the absence of the Physician, may, under the Di¬vine blessing, be the means of relieving much distress,:perhaps of saving life. Medical advice ought, how¬ever, to be taken, in all possible cases, at the commence¬ment of any disease, or on the occurrence of any ac¬cident which threatens anything like serious conse¬quences.ABSCESS on BEADING.Causes Internal inflammatory action, foreign bo¬dies, diseased bone, &c.Symptoms.—Cold shivering, throbbing pain, andsense of fulness in affected part.i Treatment Heat applied externally ; as fomenta-itions with hot water, linseed meal and hemlock poul-itices.j Observations.—After the matter is thoroughly(formed, which is known by the elastic softness of theipart, it ought to be punctured at the most prominent3part, so as to evacuate it, and again apply the poultice(for a day or two. Purgative medicines ought not toibe employed during the suppurative stage, but are pro-jper after tho matter is evacuated. The diet ought tobe light until matter is formed, but afterwards moregenerous. When there is the appearance of the party(sinking after the abscess is opened, a little wine negusis proper.4THE MEDICAL GUIDEACID IN THE STOMACH.Causes—Weak digestion, sedentary life, indigesti¬ble food, irregular meals, &c. ,Symptoms.—Uneasy pain at pit of stomach, acid!eructations, sick, and headache. In infants, cryingand drawing up the limbs, greenish coloured stools.Treatment.—To relieve, half a teaspoonful of car¬bonate of soda or magnesia, for an adult; to an infant,a little magnesia—if bowels are loose, prepared chalkmay be substituted. Animal food is least apt to gene¬rate acid.Observations.—Acidity in infants at the breast'arises very frequently from the mother’s milk, and isbest corrected by attention to herself, by avoiding in¬digestible food, and taking an anti-acid, such as car¬bonate of soda, or magnesia, once or twice a day ; alsoto take a larger portion of animal food. Infantsbrought up with the spoon are peculiarly liable to acid,and require, if bowels are bound, a little magnesia, orif there be a looseness, chalk mixture occasionallymixed with their food. The green colour of the stoolsin infants, is an infallible proof of the presence of acid.AGUE (Intermitting Fever).Causes.—Exposure to exhalation from marshes, in¬creased by poor diqt, intemperance, over-fatigue, damprooms or bed.Symptoms. — 1st Stage, cold shivering. 2nd, In¬creased, and sometimes extreme heat. 3d, Perspiration,which terminates the attack, but which recurs again atstated intervals.Treatment.—On the commencement of the coldstage, give 30 drops of laudanum, with cordials in theinterval; between the attacks administer Jesuit barkin doses of from l to 2 teaspoonfuls every few hours,or sulphate of quinine in 3 grain doses ; when thesefail, Dr. Fowler’s solution of arsenic, 10 drops, in water.THE MEDICAL GUIDE.5Observations There are three kinds or varietiesof agues:—1st, When the attack takes place everytwenty'four hours. 2nd, When it occurs every secondday. 3d, When it occurs every fourth day. Everyague is divided into three stages—the cold, the hot,and sweating stage. Ague cake (as it is named) is anenlargement of tho spleen which lies on the left side.ASTHMA (Difficult Breathing).Causes.—Exposure to cold, contracted chest, indi¬gestible food, ropelled eruptions, certain odours, &e.Symptoms.—When the fit is on, breathing is difficultand convulsive, with a sense of suffocation and constric¬tion at the pit of stomach, harrassing cough with orwithout expectoration.Treatment—Warm dry atmosphere, flannel cloth¬ing next the skin, animal food, strong coffee, teaspoon¬ful of syrup of squills with 15 drops of laudanum takenoccasionally, turpentine injections ; if bowels are con¬stipated, a tublespoonful of castor oil, with 10 and 20drops spirit of turpentine at bed times, &c. Smokersmay try stramonium mixed with the tobacco, particu¬larly when it is a dry asthma.Observations.—Persons who live much on potatoesare found very liable to asthma, particularly if theiremployment be sedentary ; also, persons exposed tosudden changes in the temperature, such as out of warmto a cold, or cold to a warm atmosphere. Persons wholive mostly on vegetables such as potatoes, ought tosubstitute animal food. Persons liable to difficultbreathing cannot be too careful to have their feel com¬fortably clad, avoid night air and all irregularities;they ought to keep their bowels open with castor oil,repeating the dose frequently. A Burgundy pitchplaster between the shoulders is often of much benefit.BILE IN THE STOMACH.Causes—Indigestible food, costive bowels, obstruc¬tion in the liver or gall ducts that convey the bile to6THE MEDICAL GCIIDE.the stomach ; also, increased action of the liver, whichcauses an overflowing of bile into the stomach.Symptoms. — Sickness, usually accompanied withvomiting of bilious matter of bitter taste.Treatment.—Drink plentifully of warm water orcamoline tea until stomach is unloaded, then take ablue mercurial pill at bed-time, and salts with sennatea, or senna and rhubarb, or an active purgative towork it off; if there is much pain in the stomach,apply a mustard poultice, or cloth dipped in turpentine,over seat of pain.Observations.—Bile in the stomach is a very gen¬eral term employed in all cases of disordered stomach,arising from any cause. Such as weak digestion, im¬proper food, irregular feeding ; and is best preventedby avoiding the causes that tend to produce it, such aslate hours, irregular meals, and intemperance. Whenthe bile accumulates to a great extent, it often inducesvomiting and purging of bile, and is then called BritishCholera, to distinguish it from another disease whichhas the same name; viz,, Asiatic Cholera, in whichthere is no bile vomited or purged, and is a perfectlydistinct disease.BURNS, SCALDS, &c.ijAUSES..—Fire, boiling water, and acrid substances,»ucn as vitriol, aqua fortis.Symptoms The symptoms are all inflammation, mo¬dified by the part that is injured, whether it be a vitalor non-\ital part; also, the extent of the burn, both asregards its depth and surface.Treatment.—Carded cotton, when put to a burnat the commencement, will often prevent its bad effects,and if allowed to remain will sometimes render othertreatment unnecessary. Sulphur sprinkled on the sur¬face, and sweet oil poured over it, has a soothing effect.Carron oil, which consists of equal parts of lime w aterand linseed oil, being frequently poured over the burn,or a linen cloth dipped in the mixture and laid over vt,is a favourite remedy with many.THE MEDICAL GUIDE.71 Observations.—Burns are of frequent occurrence,md all families should have a supply of carded cotton,weet oil, linseed oil, and lime water, particularly whenmy of their number are exposed to burning, such as■ngineers, smiths, &c. The great matter, in cases ofMiming, is prompt application of the remedy ; anyample thing that is soft, and keeps a regular temper¬ature, is answerable ; and perhaps there is not a bet-er and readier thing than a soft linen cloth wrungput of warm water and laid over the part, and carefullyCovering the wetted cloth with a dry towel or two, sois to retain the vapour. The heat of the skin keeps upthe temperature of the water, so as to retain a softipovering of vapour around it. If the burn be deep,however, it may be requisite to poultice it till the dead(part separate, and then dress it as a common sore, withhogs’ lard or Turner’s cerate spread upon a linen cloth,■&c.CHILBLAINS.( Cadses.—Sudden transition from severe cold to heat,:particularly when the feet or hands are wet.Symptoms.—Swelling and redness, sensation of heatland itching at the affected part, which is usually in thefingers and toes. In severe cases, the chilblain assumesa bluish or purplish hue.Treatment.—Rub the parts affected well with snowor ice water, or bath them in the latter several timesi daily, always taking care to dry well; another plan isi to rub them with spirits of wine, tincture of soap andt opium, ora solution of alum in vinegar.Observations When chilblains suppurate, leaving( open sores, they may be bathed with lime water, tinc¬ture of myrrh, or warm vinegar, and dressed with com-r mou citron ointment; but if very backward, they re-( quire to be touched occasionally with lunar caustic,i Active exercise in the open air, and comfortable cloth-. ing, are the best preventatives.8THE MEDICAL GUIDE.CHOLERA (Asiatic).Causes Unknown. Intemperance, and all irregilarities in living, deficiencies in food or clothing, waiof cleanliness in house or person, the use of impurwater, or accumulations of filth near dwelling, predif!pose to this, as in fact to almost every other disease.Symptoms The first and easily curable stage, issimple looseness of the bowels, which precedes the atttack of the real cholera sometimes for some days, goinf ioff and returning alternately, till the purging becomecopious, and the matter passed resembles thin gruel:then vomiting a similar fluid. After this has continuet ifor a longer or shorter period, the extremities becomecold, which extends gradually over the whole body, tiliiit has the cold feel of a corpse. The disease is accom-jipanied in the latter stage usually with cramps in thelimbs, arms, and often the whole muscular system, andwhich are the cause of intense suffering. The voicesinks into a whisper—the pulse leaves the wrist, andgradually the heart ceases to beat—a blueish lividityis over the body—the nose pinched, and the eye-balls'sink deep into the sockets, and sometimes, previous todeath, the patient has all the appearance of a living |corpse.Treatment In this formidable scourge, any goodthat is to be done must be done at the very commence¬ment, and this is to check the bowel complaint thatprecedes the real disease, and which may in general boeasily accomplished by taking 30 or 40 drops of laud¬anum (the patient having previously gone to bed). Amustard poultice ought to be applied over the stomachand bowels. Should the purging continue, a mixtureof chalk and laudanum, in the proportion of a dram ofchalk, 3 drams of laudanum, with 2 ounces mualage ofgum arabic, and the same of cinnamon water, from 1 to2 teaspoonfulls after every inclination to stool. Also,2 grain doses of calomel, administered every 20 min¬utes, until the gums get tender, when the danger isalmost over. The patient ought to be well coveredMEDICAL GUIDE.9■with bed-clothes, and be strictly enjoined on no accountito raise bis head; on this account, a bed-pan is indis-i pensable, more lives being lost by parties getting up to■go to stool than any other cause, which is in every caseto be most strictly prohibited. To relieve the intolera¬ble thirst that always exists, toast and water, and, whathas often proved highly beneficial, an infusion of coffee'without sugar or milk, of which the patient my drinkas much as he chooses. — N.B. Oak bark boiled in? water, in the proportion of 2 ounces of the bark to an| English pint of water, and injecting the full of a 3-ounce, syringe after every stool, has been found in many casesi to check the disease, and ought to be tried, as it doesi not interfere with the other modes of treatment.Observations Dr. Sutherland, the government au-| thority on this subject, was so convinced of the impor¬tance of an early attention to the premonitory symp-, toms of this disease, that his whole energies were ex-I erted to establish an efficient staff of medical assistants,! who, instead of waiting till they were sent for, had iu-I structions to visit every family in the several districts; alloted to each, to inquire into the state of the bowels,i and administering an opium pill, or a few drops oflaudanum, to check any looseness. The consequenceof this prudential arrangement has been, that hundreds,if not thousands of cases of the incipient disease, havebeen checked in the bud, which, had it been allowed togo on, would have ended in all the dreadful symptomsof genuine cholera. Would persons only be persuadedte attend to their bowels the instant they are affectedwith purging, so as to get this checked, the result wouldbe, that there would not be a single death from cholera.Let this plain fact be engraven upon the minds of everyone, so as to produce a practical influence on their con¬duct; and let attention be paid to diet and regimen —shunning spirits or spirituous liquors as they would dopoison—and also attend to keep their persons and housesclean and sweet, and use their influence to get nuisances,such as dung heaps or any other accumulation of im¬purity, removed; and let all unite their energies for thegeneral good, to supply wholesome food and warm10THE MEDICAL GUIDE.clothing for the needy, and act upon the maxim thatthe good of all is the good of each, and the benefit of eachis the benefit of all. This conduct would tend more thananything else to convert this terrible scoTirge into anactual blessing—N.B. It is remarkable that during theprevalence of Cholera in Glasgow, the inhabitants resi-dent on the south side of the river Clyde suffered muchless severely than their neighbours on the north. Thereason that medical men have ascribed for this is, thatthey are suppiled by the Gorbals Gravitation Water Co.witn water of a much purer quality. This fact is deserv¬ing of the most careful attention. Dr. Kirk, of Gree¬nock, during the prevalence of the former cholera, wasthe first to point out the premonitory looseness of bow¬els.COLDS and COUGHS.Causes.—Changes of temperature, wet clothes, dampfeet, &c.Symptoms.—Commences with a thin discharge fromthe nose, with cough and expectoration of mucous.Treatment.—Drink plentifully of linseed tea, orany mild diluent; avoid cold moist air, remain in bed ;if there be severe pain in the chest, apply a cloth dippedin turpentine.Observations.—If cough be excessive, a teasponfulof paragoric may be taken occasionally. If fever runhigh, 10 or 20 drops antimonial wine in water, repeatedwhen necessary. Though coughs and colds are not inthemselves dangerous, yet, as they may lay the founda¬tion of more serious disease, they ought to be carefullyattended to.COLIC.Causes.—Indigestible food, acrid bile, costive stateof bowels, acidities.Symptoms Pain and distention of the belly, twist¬ing round the navel, often accompanied with vomiting,&c.THE MEDICAL GUIDE.11Treatment If acid be present, half a teaspoonfulof carbonate of soda in warm water ; if acrid bile, drinkplentifully of hot water to encourage its being thrownoff by vomiting.Observations.—If costive bowels, an injection ofcastor oil and turpentine, a tablespoonful of the formerand a teaspoonful of the latter, with thin gruel. Shouldthe pain continue violent, a mustard poultice may beapplied over the belly, also 40 to 50 drops of laudanumgiven. Persons subject to the attacks of colic oughtto be careful what they eat and drink, avoiding acid,unripe fruits, or insufficiently cooked vegetables, alsofermented drinks ; and take precautions to avoid a cos¬tive state of the bowels.CONTUSIONS (Bruises).Causes External violence.Symptoms.—Pain, discolouration, and tumefactionabout the seat of injury.Treatment Foment the part with hot water, orbathe it with vinegar, or apply a poultice, or clothswrung out of hot water.Observations.—If much inflammatory action ensue,so as to affect the pulse, bleeding and purging are pro,per. If suppuration takes place, evacuate the matter bypuncturing with a lancet.CONVULSIONS in CHILDREN.Causes—Teething, worms, repelled eruptions, flatu¬lency, disordered bowels, injuries of the head, such asa blow, &e.Symptoms.—Screaming, starting, twisting of themuscles of the face, rapid movement of the eyelids andoften the whole body.Treatment.—If from teething, scarify the gums;if worms, give calomel and scamony in doses propor¬tioned to tlie age ; if costive bowels, give an injectionof salt and warm water, or castor oil and thin gruel.12THE MEDICAL GUIDE.Observations—If from repelled eruptions a hotbath in which mustard has been sprinkled ; if face beflushed, with strong pulse, apply leeches to the templesand small blisters behind the ears.CORNS.Causes. — Repeated and long-continued pressurefrom tight or high-heeled shoes.Symptoms—Horn-like hardness of the skin, causingpain when pressed upon.Treatment.—The certain cure is broad-soled softshoes ; also eight or twelve plies of linen smeared withoil, having an aperture cut in the middle exactly adaptedto the size of the corn, laid over each other, so as thatthe corn be in the opening in such a manner that ituannot be pressed upon by the shoes or stockings.Observations Considerable relief, and sometimesa permament cure, is made, by merely cutting a thinpiece off the top of the corn, and allowing the meltedtallow from a lighted candle to fall upon it. Too muchcare cannot be taken in cutting corns, as when the skinis cut or injured till the blood comes, fungus granula¬tions rise, and are difficult to heal, and may even endin mortification, &c. If the corn be at the sole of thefoot, put a felt sole in the shoe wherein a hole has beencut corresponding with the size and figure of the corn.COSTIVENESS.Causes.—Irregularity in going to stool, too muchdry food, copious sweatings, &c.Treatment.—Castor oil, from half an ounce to anounce, repeated as often as necessary ; a blue mercurialpill occasionally.Observations.—Soft food, such as porridge and but¬ter-milk or treacle to supper; chew a small bit of roughrhubarb at bed-tirne, &c ; regularity in going to stoolas near as possible at the same hour.THE MEDICAL GUIDE.13CROUP.Causes—Cold temperature.Symptoms Hoarse, sonorous cough and wheezinginspiration, which increases as the disease progresses,until suffocating gasping breathing, followed by con¬vulsive attempts at respiration ensues, amidst which thelittle creature suddenly expires.Treatment.—If the pulse be strong and heat of skinextreme, bleed from the arm, or apply leeches to thethroat j give calomel and tartar emetic, two grains ofthe former to one sixteenth of a grain of the latter,every two hours, until greenish coloured mucous stoolsappear, then give from one to two spoonfuls of castoroil.Observations.—It is sometimes of advantage to pre¬mise a wine vomit, by giving a teaspoonf'ul of antimonialor ipecacuan wine every 10 minutes until free vomitingensue. A blister over the throat may be applied tillproperly risen, when the water should be let out, andas much of the loose skin removed as possible, and dressthe surface with common issue ointment N.B. Croupis always to be regarded as a very dangerous disease,and it is only by active treatment at the very commence¬ment that we can expect any benefit; and no time oughtto be lost in sending for a skilful physician.ERUCTATION (Belching Wind).Causes Often from a bad habit, bad digestion, in¬digestible substances, &c.Symptoms.—Belchings of wind from the stomachupwards, uneasy sensation in the throat, &c.Treatment Powered ginger in food, or gingertea; avoid all food that disagrees. Brandered or roastedanimal food without vegetables, particularly cabbages,peas, and beans, &c., is the most suitable.Observations.—Eructation is sometimes the resultof giving way to a bad habit, and is to be prevented bythe party liable to it strenuously resisting the offensiveindulgence.14THE MEDICAL GUIDE.ERUPTIONS OF THE SKIN.Causes.~-In children, want of cleanliness; irritationfrom teething; disordered bowels from bad milk, &c.Stmptoms.—The symptoms depend upon the cause;one resembles measles, another the itch, and a thirdconsists of large loose scabs on the forehead and face.Treatment.—The utmost attention to cleanliness isindispensable; if bowels are costive,give a teaspoonfulof magnesia ; when the rush is present, keep the childmoderately warm to prevent it striking in.Observations.—The occasional employment of thewarm bath, light food, and abundant supply of purewater as drink. A not unfrequent cause of eruptionson the skin is venereal disease, which descends to theoffspring ; in such a case the infant must be treated forthis disease. Scorbutic eruptions must be treated asscurvy.EXCORIATIONS OF INFANTS.Causes Want of cleanliness, inattention to dryingthe infant after washing, &c.Symptoms.—Chafing in the neck, behind the earsarm-pits, or groin.Treatment Dry the skin well, after washing, witha soft thoroughly dry cloth, sprinkling a little dustingpowder over the excoriated parts, and excoriation willspeedily vanish.Observations.—Children of a full habit, duringteething, are very liable to excoriations, and requireopening medicines frequently repeated. — N.B. Cleandry under clothing is indispensable.EYES, Inflammation of.Causes.—Effects of cold, external injuries, extrane¬ous bodies, &c.Symptoms Pain, heat, redness of the eyeballs, in¬tolerance of light, &c.THE MEDICAL GUIDE.15Treatment Fomentation of warm water; bathing;with sugar of lead water ; drop into the eye 2 or 3 dropsof solution of nitrate of silver, 3 grains to the ounce ofwater, morning and night.Observations. — Sometimes after the severity of theinflammation is subdued, specks remain on the eye thatobscure vision ; the solution of the nitrate of silvershould be dropped into the eyes, or an eyewash con¬sisting of 10 grains white vitriol and 15 grains commonsalt, disolved in a gill of spring water, putting a dropor two into the affected eye morning and night.FAINTINGS, &c.Causes.—Mental emotion; over blood-letting;hysterical affection, aggravated by disordered bowels ;indigestible food, &c.; organic diseases of the heart;tight-lacing (very frequent).Symptoms Paleness, and respiration suspended,the party being for the time in a state of insensibility ;when animation returns, she is affected sometimes withconvulsions, belching of wind, &c.Treatment.—Hartshorn smelling salts ; burnt fea¬thers to the nostrils ; dash cold water over face; admita free current of air ; relievo party from tight corsets,&c.Observations.—Females are more liable to swoon-ings and faintings than males. The reason for this istheir more susceptible organization,but a frequent causeis wearing tight stays, a practice which, while deformingthe natural symmetry of the figure, exercises a mostprejudicial influence on the health, and should be repro¬bated as much as the women of China crushing theirfeet into the compass of an ordinary snuff-box. Whenwill the fair sex of these islands abandon this mon¬strously absurd practice so fraught with evil? not, wesuspect, till a few spirited females will resolve to besingular, and discard tight-lacing as a species of suicide 116THE BIEDICAI, GUIDE.FLUX (Dysentery,).Causes—State of the atmosphere, eating unripefruits and vegetables, exposure to cold and damp, un¬wholesome food, &c.Symptoms.—Pain in the bowels, accompanied withgriping; pressing pain at stool, which consists princi¬pally of mucous tinged with blood.Treatment—At the commencement of the attack,an emetic of 15 grains ipecacuan, to 1 grain of tartaremetic, and drinking plentifully of linseed tea, follow¬ing up this with 1 ounce of castor oil, with from 20 to30 drops of laudanum, and keeping warm in bed for aday or two, will often check the disease in the bud.Observations.—If it progress, use clysters of starchand laudanum after every inclination to stool, &c. Ateaspoonful of laudanum may be added to the injectionin the case of an adult, 5 to 16 drops to an infant.Dysentery is a very troublesome disease, and when onceestablished is very intractable, leaving the subject afterrecovery in a weak languid state, and liable to a relapseon any impropriety on his part. Hence the necessityof attention to the first symptoms. Roll of flannel wornround the bowels is a good precautionary measure, andthe utmost attention to diet, which ought to be princi¬pally animal.GIDDINESS.Causes Fullness of blood in the head, flatulence,&c.Symptoms,—Objects appear whirling round; un¬steady gait, and tendency to fall.Treatment.—If from fulness of blood, leeches to thetemples; cooling purgatives, as salts, &c.; vegetablediet. If from flatulence, a teaspoonful of tincture ofvalerian, or 10 drops of hartshorn and water.Observations.—The habits of the patient, whetherintemperate in eating and drinking, or otherwise, alsowhether he be short-necked, of a florid complexion, orthe reverse, ought to be taken into account; otherwisedanger may be incurred in adopting active treatmentwithout the advice of medical men, who ought to beconsulted at the commencement.THE MEDICAL GUIDE.i7GRAVEL and STONEIN THE KIDNEYS OR BLADDER.Causes.—Indigestion, improper nutriment, impurewater, sedentary life, &c.Symptoms Pain and difficulty in passing water,whicli often, when the party is affected, contains sandydeposit, sometimes of a vermillion red colour; in others,like a brick dust; while in a third there is a whitishpowder.Treatment When an attack of gravel or stone issevere, much relief is often experienced by the warmhip bath, or cloths wrung out of hot water and appliedover seat of pain ; also give soap pills, one 3 times aday; or potash water, ten drops in a wine-glassful ofwarm water ; or a teaspoonful of carbonate of soda inwater. The patient ought to drink plentifully of lin¬seed tea.Observations.—When a fit of the gravel comes on,there is a pain in back and loins, numbness of the thighof the affected side; nausea and vomiting, &c. Stonein the kidneys or bladder is usually a formidable dis¬ease, and the treatment of it is only to be entrusted tothe care of a skilful surgeon; nor ought any party todelay a moment in consulting proper skill, when thesimple rules afore-mentioned have proved ineffectual.It is worthy of notice that temperate people who drinkplentifully of pure water, are seldom troubled with thismalady. (See Remarks on Acid in the Stomach.)GRIPES IN INFANTS.Causes—Irritating matter in the bowels, flatulence,&c.Symptoms.—Child screams violently, twists itself onnurse’s arm ; belly hard, sounds like a drum whentapped upon.Treatment Give a teaspoonful of magnesia orcastor oil, with from 2 or 3 drops of laudanum, or 10drops aromatic spirit of hartshorn in water.Observations—Warm the infant’s feet and bowelsbefore the fire, rubbing them gently with the hand ;ISTHE MEDICAL GUIDE.introduce a properly-shaped bit of soap, to induce thebowels to act.HEADACHE.Causes.—Effects of cold, especially sitting in a cur¬rent of air ; bile or acid in stomach ; fulness of blood,want of sleep, &c.Symptoms.—Pain, dull or acute and throbing, some¬times darting through head ; sense of heat over fore¬head and temples.Treatment Depending upon the cause that givesrise to it. In general, bathing the head witli vinegarand water; and giving opening medicine such as seid-litz powders, &c.Observations.—The great matter is to ascertain thecause that produces headache (which is the accompani¬ment of many diseases), such as costive bowels, mentalexcitement, &c., and prescribe accordingly.HEARTBURN.Causes.—Indigestion ; errors in diet, very fre¬quently producing acid in the stomach.Symptoms.—Burning uneasy sensation in the sto¬mach.Treatment.—If from acid, immediate relief is ob¬tained by taking half a teaspoonful of carbonate of sodaor magnesia.Observations.—Brandered animal food is best forpersons who are predisposed to acid.HOOPING COUGH.Causes Specific contagion, modified by the seasonof the year.Symptoms.—Repeated fits of coughing, which, afterthe disease is formed, is accompanied with a sonorousinspiration, called the hoop ; increased heat of surface.Treatment.—Measures to subdue the fever, suchas light food, abundance of fluids to drink; if muchpain is felt in chest, leech and blister; give an emeticof ipecacuan wine occasionally.Observations.—After the inflammatory symptomshave subsided, a change of air from the town to theTHE MEDICAL GUIDE.country, or, if the child be resident in the country, fortlie town, lias a singularly beneficial effect; of course,attention to the bowels is necessary, and an embroca¬tion to the back, consisting of strong spirits, in whichbruised garlic has been steeped for six hours, orRooche’s Embrocation.—N.B. The child ought towear flannel clothing next the skin.ITCH.Causes.—Infection, encouraged by inattention tocleanliness.Symptoms Watery pustules about the fingers,wrists, and hams; intolerable itching.Treatment -The popular remed}', sulphur mixedwith hogs’ lard, rubbed over the skin, answers verywell. When this remedy fails, add 1 part of mercurialointment to 10 parts of the sulphur, &c., which is a cer¬tain cure.Observations.—After disease is checked, the bedand body clothes of the patient require to be carefullyscoured, else the disease will return.LOOSENESS (Diarrhcea).Causes.-^-Irritating substances in the stomach orbowels, such as indigestible food ; irritable state of thebowels, owing to obstructed perspiration, &c.Symptoms.—Purging of copious watery feculent mat¬ter, accompanied with nausea, griping pains, andflatu-lenee.Treatment.—A brisk purge of castor oil, or tinc¬ture of rhubarb with 20 drops of laudanum to carry oil'offensive matter; then chalk mixture, with a few dropsof laudanum.Observations If looseness continue, calomel andchalk in small doses 3 times daily ; bread and milkboiled, as diet. In long continued looseness, the useof astringents, such as tincture of catechu or kino.—N.B. A flannel roller around bowels is useful, &c.MEASELS.Causes Specific contagion.Symptoms.—Commences with sneezing, watery red-20THE MEDICAL GUIDE.ness over eyes, pain in head, hoarse cough, increasedheat, then small darkish red spots over body.Treatment.—Measles is in general a mild disease,requiring little treatment besides keeping the patientmoderately warm. The apartment ought to be dark,ened, and the patient have plenty of fluid to drink.Observations When inflammatory symptoms runhigh, bleeding with leeches; when eruption is repelled,the hot bath with mustard. Whiskey and sulphur is anold and a popular, but a very questionable remedy em¬ployed for striking out the rash. After the eruptionhas disappeared, a little opening medicine, as castoroil, senna tea, &c., ought to be given.PILES.Causes Habitual costiveuess ; hard riding; strain¬ing at stool; the use of aloetic purgatives, &c.Symptoms Small hard tumours at the verge of theanus, causing much pain, which is increased by activeexercise or straining at stool; occasionally dischargeof blood from anus.Treatment.—Rest in recumbent posture; laxitivemedicines, such as sulphur and cream of tartar, a tea¬spoonful of each, taken each night in treacle, or chewbit of rhubarb root; anoint with pile ointment, the bestconsists of five grains of gallic acid to an ounce of lard.Observations.—If piles bo excessively painful, alittle extract of opium ought to be added to the oint¬ment. The use of ardent spirits, wines, or ales, mustbe entirely interdicted. The food should be light, andof easy digestion N.B. It is sometimes useful to ap¬ply leeches or get the piles lanced ; a warm poultice oflinseed being immediately afterwards applied to encour¬age the bleeding.RHEUMATISM (Acute).Causes.—Exposure to cold or damp.Symptoms Pain, often extreme in the part affected,generally the arms, shoulders, back, limbs, or joints,sometimes all of them, accompanied with quick, hardpulse, and other febrile symptoms.Treatment Sharp treatment is best, such as blood-THE MEDICAL CCIDE.21letting ; or combine tartrate of antimony, ten grains,to three ounces epsom salts, dissolved in a quart ofwater, a wine glassful every twenty minutes till freepurging and vomiting ; rub affected part with turpen¬tine, hartshorn and oil, essence of mustard ; use vapourbath, &c.Observations The use of the cold bath, or spong¬ing the body with cold water, is an excellent preventa¬tive, and when the acute symptoms of the disease is re¬moved, is a powerful means of restoring the system,and steeling it against a renewal of the attack of rheu¬matism. Quinine, in doses from 1 to 5 grains, an hourbefore a meal, is sometimes a valuable auxiliary towardsremoving the remaining symptoms, and warding off anattack of rheumatism.RHEUMATISM (Chronic).Causes.—When the acute stage is improperly treated,it is succeded by the chronicSymptoms.—The pain in back or limbs, &c., becomespermanent, and the party is affected by every changein the atmosphere, so as to resemble a weatherglass.Treatment A teaspoonful of tincture of meadow-saffron morning and night, with from 35 to 60 drops oflaudanum at bed time; a teaspoonful of oil of turpen¬tine in a tablespoonful of castor oil repeated occasion¬ally. N.B A tablespoonful of cod liver oil 3 limes aday has been found to answer as a specific in rheumatism.Observations The observations on Acute Rheu¬matism apply here also.RINGWORM.Causes—Infection, from the use of a comb, &c., ofa party affected with the disease.Symptoms.—Cluster of small red pimples, forming acircular ring; when on the head, causing the hair tofall off, having a great tendency to spread.Treatment.—Strong decoction of galls, or solutionof corrosive sublimate, three grains to ounce of water ;bathe affected part.Observations.—There is often a necessity to get22T HE MEDICAL GUIDE.the head shaved and washed with black soap and waterbefore the remedies will take effect.—N.B.

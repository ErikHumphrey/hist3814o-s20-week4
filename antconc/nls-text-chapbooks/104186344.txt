'3THE tALE.There liv’d in Fife an auld, (lout, warldly chid,Wha’s ftomach kend na** fare but milk and meal jA wife he had, I think ca'd her Bell,And twa big fons, amaitt aa heigh'a himfel.’ IRab was a g!eg, fmart cock, wi’ pouthert pafh,Fiingan, a flow, feart, baflifu’, Ample hafh.Baith to the College gaed. At firfl; fpruce Rab,At Greek and Latin, grew a very dab:He beat a' rcun’ about him, fair and clean.And ilk ane courted him to be their frien’ iFraehoule to houfe they harl’d him to dinner,But curft poor Ringan for a hum-drum flnner.• \ 1Rab tanked now in Ac a lofty drain,As tho’ braid Scotland had been a’ his ain,He ca’d the Kirk the Church, the Yirth the GiobfAnd chang’d his name forfooth* frae Rab to Rob.Whare’er ye met him, flourithing his rung,The hale difcourfe was murder’d wi’his tongue.On friends and faes wi' impudence he fet,And ramm’d his nofe in ev’ry thing he ijtet.The College now, to Rab grew douf and dull.He fccrn’d wi’books to dupify his fl uil;But whirl’d to Plays and Balls, and fic like places,And roar’d awa’ at Fairs and Kintra Races :Sant hame for filler Irae-his mittier Bell,And caft a horfe, and rade a race himfel’;Drank night and day, and fyne when^ mortal fu%P*ow’d on the floor, and fnoi’d like cny ibw ;Lod a’ his filler wi’ fome gambling fparks,And pawn’d for punch, bis Bible and his farks ;tTill) driven at laft to ovrti be bad enougb)Gaed hame a’ rags to baud his father’s pleugh.Poor hum-drum Ringan, placed anither part.For Ringan'wanted neither wit nor art;Of mony a far-aff place he tend the gate;Was deep, deep learn’d, but unco, unco blare.He kend how mony mile’twas to the moon,How mony rake wad lave the ocean toom ; •Wh&re, a' the fwallows gaed in time o’ fnaw ;What gars the thunder roar, and tempefts blawWhare lamps a* filler grow aneath the grun iHlw a’ this yirth rows round about the fun ;In fltort, on books fae meikle time be fpent.Ye cou'dna fpeak o’ ought, but Riugan kent-Sae meikle learning, wi’ fae little pride.Soon gained the love o’ a’ the kintra fide,And Death, at that time, happ’ning to nip affThe Pariflr Minifter—a poor dull ca’f,Ringan was fought he cou’dna fry them nay.And there he’s preaching at this very day.MORAL.Now,. Mr. Prefident* I think ’tis plain.That youthfu’diffidence is certain gain.Inftead of blocking up the road to knowledge,,It guides alike, in G&mmerce or at College ;Struggles, the burftsof paflion to contrcul,Feeds all the finer feelings of the foul;Defies the deep laid ftratagems of guile.And gives even innocence a fw.eeter fmile ;Enno'eles all the little worth we have.And fhidds our virtue even to the grave.5How wgft. the difPrence then, between the twain SSince pl«a;nre efrer is purfu’d by pain.Pieafure’s'a Syren, with inviting arms.Sweet is her voice, and pow’iful are her charms ;Lur’d by her call, we trtad her fiow’ry ground,Joy wings out fteps, and mufic warbles round jLull’d in her arms, we lofe the flying hours,And lie endoofom’d midft her blooming bow’rs.Till—arm’d with death, (lie watches our undoing,Stabs while Ihe fihge, and triumphs in our ruin.END ©F RAB AND “RINSAN.The following Tale was recited by the Author at thePantheon^ in a Debate on the Qiteftiofi, “ Whetheris Difappointment in Love, or the Lofe of Fortunehardejl to bear.” *THE LOSS O’ THE PACK,A TRUE TALE.(Recited in the Character of a peer Pedlar.JBoutoates I hate, quo’ girn'w'g Maggy Pringle,Syne harl’d Watty, greeting, thro’ the ingle.Since this fell queition feems fae lang t& hing on,InWwa-three words I’ll gie ye my opinion.I wha (land here,in this bare fcoury coat.Was ance a Packman, wordy ttjeny a groat:I’ve canied Packs as big’s your rr.eikle table;I’ve fcarted pats, and fleepet in a ftable :Sax pounds;! wadna for try patk anceta’fcn.And I could bamldly brag ’iwas a’ mine ain.6Ay! thae war da^indeed, that gart me hope, */Aeblins, thro’ time, to warfle up a (hop:And as a wife aye in my noddle ran,I kend my Kate wad grapple at me than.0 Kate was paft compare ! fic cheeks! lie een !Sic fmiling looks ! were never, never feen.n Dear, dear I lo’ed her, and whane'er we met,Pleaded to have the bridal-day but fet| Stappet her pouches fu’ o’ prins and laces,And thought rnyfel’ weel paid wi’ twa three kiffes,Yet ftill fte put it aff frae day^o day,And aften kindly in my lug wad, fay, '“ Ae half-year linger is nae unco ilop,“ We’ll marry then, and fyne fet up a Ihop.”O Sir, but lafles words are faft and fair!They footh our grief, and banifh ilka care;Wha wadna toil to pleafe the lafs be lo’es ?*A lover true minds this in a’ he does.Finding her mind was thus fee firmly bent,And that I coudnaget her to relent,There was nought left, but quietly to refign,To heeze my pack for ae lang hard campaign ;And as the Highlands was the place for meat,1 ventur’d therein fpite of wind and weet.Cauld now the Winter blew, and deep the fna’For three hale days inceffantly did fa’Far in a murr, am'ang the whirling drift,Whar nought was feen but mountains and the lift,I loft my road, and wander’d mony a mile,Maift dead w»’ hunger, caula, and fright, and toil.Thus wand’ring, call or weft, I kend na’ where,My mind o’erceme wi’ gloom and black defpair,7Wi* a fell tinge, I plung’d at ance, forfooth,Down thro’ a wreath o’ fnaw, up to my mouth.Clean o’er my head my precious wallet flew,But whar it gaed, Lord kens, I never knew !What great misfortunes are pour’d down on fomejI thought my feaifu’ hinderen’ was come !Wi’ grief and forrow was my faul o’ercaft,Lk breath I drew was like to be my laft ;For aye the mair I warfl’d roun’ and roun’,I fand myfel’ aye flick the deeper down •,Till ance, at length, wi’ a prodigious pull,I drew my poor cauld carcafe frae the hole.Lang, lang I fought and graped for my pack.Till night and hunger forc’d me to come back.For three lang hours I wander’d up and down,Till chance, at laft convey’d me to a town :There, wi’ a trembling hand, I wrote my KateA fad account of a’ my lucklefs fate ;But bade her aye be kind, and no defpair,Since life was left, l foon wad gather mair ;Wi* whilk, I hop’d, within a towmond’a date.To be at hame, and {hare it a’ wi’ KateFool that I was, how little did I thinkThat love wad foon be loft for fa’t o’ Clink.The lofs of fair won wealth, tho’ hard to bear.Afore this—ne’er had pow’r to force a tear.I trufted time wad bring things round again.And Kate, dear Kate ! wad then be a’ mine ain :Conlol’d my mind in hopes o’ better luck.But, O ! what fadreverfe !—bow thunderftruck lWhan ae black day brought word frae Rab my brilh-That Kate was cried, and manied on anitber !

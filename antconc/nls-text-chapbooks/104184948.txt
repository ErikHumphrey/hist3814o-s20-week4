It is therefore recomended to pay a strictnention to this object, as by that means you willadoubtedly gain very excellent knowledge foraur pains.And first is given the names of the several linesI they hold their places, and then particularizsteir qualities.There are five principle lines in the hand, viThe I-ineof Life, or Life Line as it is heealled.The Line of Death.The Table Line.The Girdle of Venus.The Line of Fortune.And besides these there are other Lines, as thLine of Saturn ; the Liver Line and some othersbut these only serve to explain the principal Line.;The chief Lines on which persons of the profesision lay the greatest stress, is the Line of Life, o|the Life Line, as it is here called, which generalht .kes its rise where the thumb joint plays withthe wrist on the inside, and runs in an obliquedirection to the inside of the innermost joint ofthe fore finger.The next is the Line of Death which separatesthe fleshy part of the hand on the little fingerside, from the hollow of the hand, running invarious directions in differ mt people.The fable Line originates with the Life Line,at the wrist, and runs through the hollow of tirehand towards tlie rsicUile finger.The Girdle of Venus, takes its course from theextremity of the innermost jointof the little finger,and forming s curve, terKBtvaxcs between the foreand middle fingers.The Line of Fortune, strikes from behind theball, or mount of the tore finger, across the palmand Lino of Life, and looses itself in or near thefleshy part of the hand on the little finger side.If the Line of Lite is crossed by other Lines ator hear the wrist, the person will meet with sicknessin the beginning of life, and the degree of sicknesswill beproportioned tothesize length.and breadthof the intervening lips. If the Life Line runsfair and interrupted, the person will enjoy goodhealth; and according to its length towards themtside of the fore finger, you may judge if thesnerson will live long, as the longer the Line theonger the Life.If the Line of Death is short, and runs even,ivithout being broken or divided, it shews that theverson will enjoy a.good health of days, and not bei'abject to many maladies ; but if it is interrupted,t evidently shews that the persons life will be en-langered by illness, but by the care of Providencevill recover.When the Table Line is broad, strong, and wellnarked, it shews the person to be of a sound con-ititution, and peaceable contented mind; if it i*>roken, it shews for every break a violent interrup¬tion to happiness ; if these breaks happen towardsshe part next the wrist, he will be crossed in love,itnd either be disappointed in the person he hasixed his affections on, or be saddled with a person|>f a disobliging temper, and a most audaciousland abusive tongue.The girdle of Venus, when it goes on fair and'well marked, shews that the person will be pros¬perous inlove, fair in bis dealings with the fair sex,and be sincerely beloved ; he will obtain a partnerflor life of a fortune equal to his own, sweet tem-iiered, faithful, and affectionate ; but if it is inter-upted at its beginning near the little finger, hevill meet with early disappointments in love ; if:owards the middle of the line, he will ruin hislealth, a;id injure his fortune with lewd prostitutes;fnear the end, he will be foolisly amorous in his|>ld age, still expecting to gain the heart of avoman, bnt never obtain it.Ttie Line of Fortune, by its approach to the3-irdle of Venus, shews that thei^e is a strong kin¬dred between them, and their distance at their twoextremities clearly point out that love is inconsistantwith childhood and old age ; yet in those wherei the cross line approach from the one to the other12near the ends* prove that the persons were or willbe suspectible of love in childhood, or old age.If the hollow palm of the haad, which some callthe plain of Mars, is full of cross lines running intoeach other, the person will be of a humorsome. un¬even. and testy temper, jealous and hasty, quarrel¬some and fighting, ar.d endeavouring to set othersby the ears ; he will meet with very frequent mis¬fortunes, and bear them very uneasily; whereas, ifthe hollow or palm of the hand has none bat theunavoidable lines, that is to say, those that mustunavoidably pass through it, he will be of a sweetand amiable disposition, full of sensibility, gratitudeand love, faithful, benevolent, and kind, and thoughsubject to losses, crosses, ana disappointments, willbear them with an even and agreeable temper ;from this party chiefly, it is recommended to per¬sons to chuse their companions for life, either for ;friendship or mirriage.The mount or ball of the thumb, bears a parti¬cular anology to the events of a person’s life, withrespect to disputes, quarrels and lawsuits ; if thismount has many long strait lines reaching fromthe .thumb to the Line of Life, they show that theperson will haveseveral personal encounters; eitherwith hands, chibs, pistols or swords, but if the linesare curved and crooked, they will indicate law¬suits, and according to the degree of crookedness,they will be long or short; but if these lines endin a straight direction towards the line of life, theywill end prosperously, whether encounter or law¬suits, if otherwise, they will be attended with anunfavourable issue; the nearer to the line of lifethese lines begin, the later in a person’s life thequarrels or law-suits will take place; and thenearer to the line of life they end, the later in life -they will terminate.13TO TELL FORTUNES BY THE GROUNDSOF A COFFE CUP'Directions to pour out the Coffee grounds.Pour the grounds of coffee in a white cup, shakei hem well about in it, so that their particles maymver the surface of the whole cup ; then reverse: nto the saucer, that superfluous parts may betrained, and the figuresrequirod for fortune-tellingre formed. The person that acts the fortune tellernust bend theii thoughts upon the person thatwishes their fortune told, and upon their rank andprofession, in order to give plausibility to theirpredictions. It is not to be expected upon takingIJip the cup, that the figures will be accuratelyrepresented as they are in the pack, and it is quiteefficient if they bear some resemblance to any>f the following emblems.: The Bonds,!Or serpentine lines, indicate ways ; if the}' aremvered with clouds, they are said to be infalliblenarks either of past or future reverses. Iff they ap[ear clear and serene, they are a sure token ofome fortunate chance near at hand: encompassednth very many dots, they signify an accidentaljain of money, likewise long fife._ The Ming.Signifies marriage ; if a letter is near it, it denoteso the person that has his fortune told, the initial>f the name of the party to be married. Likewise,f the ring is in the clear,/it portends happy anducrative friendship. Surrounded with clouds, de¬igns that the person is to use precaution in friend-•hip he is about to contract. If the ring appearsit the bottom of the cup, it forebodes an entireeparation from the beloved object.The Leaf of Clover,I Is as well here as in common life, a lucky sigr;.ts different position in the cup alone makes the diff¬erence ;'because it is on the top, it shews that,14 1the good fortune is not far distant; butitig subjectthe good fortune is not far distant; but'll is subjectto delay, if it is in the middle, or at the bottom.Should clouds surround it, it shews that many dis¬agreeables wiil attend the good fortune; in theclear, prognosticates serene and undisturbedhappiness, as bright as the party wishes.The Anchor,The emblem of hope and commerce, impliessuccessful business carried on by sea and by land,if on the bottom of the cup ; at the top. and inthe clear part, i* shews constant love, and an un¬shaken fidelity. In the thick and clouded partof it also denotes love, but tinctured with theinconstancy of the butterfly.The Serpent,Always the emblem of falshood and enmity, islikewise here a general sign of an enemy. On the 1top, or in thejmiddle of the cup, it promises to theconsulting party the triumph which he desiresover his enemy ; but he will,not obtain it so easilyif the serpent be in the thick or cloudy thick. Bythe letter which frequently appears near the em¬blem, the enemy may easily be guessed, it makesthe initial of his name.The Letter.By letters, we communicate to our friends eitherpleasant or unpleasant news, and ^uch is the casehere : if this emblem is in the clear part, it denotesthe speedy arrival of welcome news : surroundedwith dots, it anounees the arrivalof a considerateremittance of money : but hemmed in by cloudsit is quite the contrary', and forebodes some mel¬ancholy or baa tidings, a loss, or some othersinister accident.The Coffin.The emblem of death, pronosticates the samething here, or at least a long and tedious illness, .if it be in the thick or turbid In the clear, it de¬notes long life. In the thick, at top of the cup,15it signifies a considerable^estate left to the party bysome rich relation:'in the same manner at thebottom, it shews that the deceased is not so near¬ly related to the consulting party.The SlarDenotes happiness if in the clear, and at the topof the cup : clouded, or in the thick, it signifieslong life, though exposed to various vicissitudesand troubles. If dotes are about it, it foretellsgood fortune, wealth, high respectabilty, &e.Several stars denote so many good and happychildren ; but surrounded with dashes, shews thatchildren will cause you grief and vexation in yourold age, and that you ought to prevent it bygiving them a good education in time.The Dog.Being at all times the emblem of fidelity or envy,has also a two-fold meaning here. At the top, inthe clear, it signifies true and faithful friends ; butif his image be surrounded with clouds or dashes,it shews that those whom you take for yourfriends, are rot to he depended on ; but if the dogbe at the bottom of the cup, you have to dreadthe effects of extreme envy or jealousy.The Lily.If this emblem be at the top, or in the middle ofthe cun, it signifies that the consulting party eitherhas or will have a virtuous spouse; if it be at thebottom, it denotes' quite the reverse. In the clearthe Jily further betokens long and happy life ; ifclouded, or in tl e tliick. it portends trouble andvexation, especially on the part of one’s relation.The CrossBe it one or more, it generally predicts adversities.Its position vat ies, and so do the circumstances. Ifit be at the top, and in the clear, shews that themisfortunes of the party will soon be at an end, 01that he will easily get over them ; but if it appearsin the middle, or at the bottom in the thick, the16party must expect many severe trials; if it ap¬pear with dots, either in the clear or in the thick,it promises a speedy change of one’s sorrow.- The clouds.If they be more light than dark, you may expecta good result from your hopes ; but if they areblack, yo-u may wive it up. Surrounded with dotsthey imply success in trade, and in all your under¬takings; but the brighter they are, the greaterwill be your happiness.The Sun.An emblem of the greatest luck and happiness,if in the clear ; but in the thick it bodes a greatdeal of sadness : surrounded by dots or dashes, de¬notes that an alteration will easily take place.1'he Moon.If it appears in the cleat, it denotes high honours;in the dark, or thick part, it implies sadness, whichwill, however, pass without great prejudice. Butif it be at the bottom of the cup, the consultingparty will be fortunate both by water and land.Mountain.If it represents only one mountain, it indicatesthe favour of people of high rank, but several ofthem, especially in the thick, are signs of powerfulenemies; in the clear they signify the contrary, orfriends in high ilfe, who are endeavouring to pro¬mote the consulting partyThe Tree *One tree only, be it in the clear or thick part,points out lasting health; several trees denotesthat your wish will be accomplished.The Child.In the clear part it bespeaks innocent intercoursebetween the consultor and another person ; in thethick part, excesses in love matters, attended withgreat expences: at the bottom of the cup, it de¬notes the consequences of lubidinous amours,and a very destructive end.17The true method c*f telling your Fortune, byCARDS.'TAKE a pack of Cards, and pick six cnit ofeach sort, viz, the 3, 9, 10, Knave, King & Queen,these being the most Prophectic Cards iii the packLet the person whose Fortune is to be learned beij blindfolded.

ITHE madnds of this unmuzzled age has drivenme to mountains of thoughts, and a continualmeditation ; It is enough to make an old wife rin red¬wood, and drive a body beyond the halter’s end.oflill-nature, to fee what I fee, and hear what I hear:Therefore the hinges of my anger are broke, and thebbands of my good and mild nature are burft in two,the door of civility is laid quite open, plain fpeech and ;mild admonition is of none effeiT; nothing muftbe ufed now but thunder bolts of reproach tartlytrimm’d in tantalizing ftile, roughly redd up and ma-nufadtured thro’ an old matron’s mouth, who is indeedbut frail in the teeth,-but will fqueeze furprifingly withher auld gums until her very ehaft bleds crack in thecrufhing of your vice.I fhall branch out my difeourfie in four heads;Firft, What I have feen, and been witnefs to.ijecondly, What I now fee, and am witnefs to.Thirdly, What I have heard, does hear, and cannothelp; I mean the difference between the old womenand the young.Fourthly, Conclude with an advice to young men iand young women how to avoid the buying of Janet j]uniper’s (linking butter*, which will have a rotten frift on their ftomach as long as they live.Firft, The firft thing then, I fee and obferve is, ,That a when daft' giddy-headed, cock-nofed, juni- jper-nebbed mothers, bring up a wheen fky-racket •!dancing daughters, a’bred up to be ladies, withoutfo much as the breadth of their lufe of land : it’s anadmiration to me where the lairds are a’ to comefrae that’s to be coupled to them; work, na, na, mybairn muft not work, (lie’s to be a lady, they ca’ hermifs, I muft have her ears bor’d, fays all Mumps the Jmother; thus the poor pet is brought up like a mo-therlefs lamb, or a parrot in the cage ; they learn no-* A nick name to a wife’s daughter that no man will marry becaufe .(hided up with lazinefs, felf conceit and Hinging pride ; or if (he be imarried (he’ll ly like (linking butter on hisltomach, while (he live.s( 3 ). > . .(thing but to priclcand few, and fling their feet when thefiddle plays, fo they become a parcel of yellow-facedftmale taylors, unequal matches for countrymen, Flan¬kers babies, brought up in a box, and ipult be carried| in a balket, knows nothing but pinching poverty,[hunger and pride, can neither milk kye, muck a byre,'icard, fpin, nor yet keep a cow from a corn-rig ; thei molt of fuch are as blind penny-worths, as buying pigsiin pocks, and ought only to be matched with Tacket-Imakers, Tree-trimmers, and Male-taylors, that theyhnaybe male and female agreeable in trade, fince theiripaper-faced fingers are tict for hard labour; yet theymight alfo pafs on a pinch for a black Sutor’s wife, forthe ftitebing of white feams round the mouth of a la ¬dy’s flioe, or with Barbers or Bakers they might be[[buckled, becaufe of their muflin-mouth and pinch¬beck fpeeches, when barm is fcant they can blow upthe bread with fair wind, and when the razor is rough,can trim their chafts with a fair tale, oil their perukewith her white lips, and powder the beaus pow witha French puff; they are well verfed in all the fcieticeof flattery, m’Tical-tunes, horn-pi^tSjand country dan¬ces, tho’ perfect in none but the reel of tjammoji.Yet thefe are they the fickle farmer fixes Lis fancyupon ; a bundle of clouts, a fkeleton of bones, Flag¬gy and the mutch, like twa fir-flicks and a pickletow, neither for his plate nor his plow ; very unpro¬per plenifliing, neither for his profit nor his pli'-tfure,to plout her hands thro’ Hawkey’s caff-cug is a hate¬ful hardfhip for Mammy’s pet, and will hack a’ herbinds. Ail this have I feen and heard, and been wit-nefs too, but my pen beiog a goofe-quili, cannot ex-pofe their names nor places of abode, but warns theworking men out of their way[ Secondly, I fee another fort, that can work andm^un work till they be married and become miftrefsthemfelves; but as the'hufband receives them, thethrift leaves them ; before that, they wrought as for akager, they fpan as for a premium, bufket as for a[brag, fcour’d their din fkins as a wauker does worfl-Jed blankets, kept as a mirn in the mouth as a mini-fter's wife, comely as Diana, chafte as Sufanna, yeathe whole of their toil is the trimming of their rig-|ging, tho’ their hulls be everlaftingly in a laking con-1dition ; their backs and their bellies are box’d abouswith the fins of a big fifh, fix petticoats, a gown, andapron, befides a fide fark down to the anclebones, ah 1what monftrous rags are here, what a cloth is confirm¬ed for a covering of one pair of buttocks; I leave itto the judgement of. any ten taylors in the town, i!thirty pair of men’s breeches may not be cut from alittle above the eafing of Befly’s bum, and this makes:her a motherly woman, as ftately a fabric as ever!firade to market or mill.But when (he’s married, (he tilrns a madam, hermiftrefs did not work much, and why fhould fire rHer mother tell’d ay fire wad be a lady, but cou’d ne¬ver fhow where her lands lay ; but when money is allfpent, ciedit broken, and conduft out of keeping, a•when babling bubly bairns crying piece minny, por-trech minny, the w'itlefs wanton wafter is at her wit’send. W ork now pr want, and do not fay that theiworld has war’d you ; but lofty Nodle, youf giddy-headed mother has led you aftray, by learning you to■ be a lady before you was fit to be a fervant-lafs, byteaching you lazinefs inftead of hard labour, by giv¬ing you fuch a high conceit of yourfelf, that nobodythinks any thing of you now, and you may judgeyoutvelf to be one of thofe that wife people call Little-worth ; but after all, my dear dirty-face, when youbegin the world again, be perfe&ly rich before you begentle, work haid for what you gain, and you’ll kenbetter hew to guide it, for pride is an unperfefl: for¬tune, and a ludicrous life will not laft long.Another fort I fee, who has got more filver thanfenfe, more gold than good nature, more muflins andmeans than good manners-, tho’ a fackcan hold theiriilver, fix houfes and an half cannot contain their am¬bitious defires. FortunatuV wonderful purfe would ifail in fetching in the forth part of their worldlywants, and the children imitate their mother's chat¬tering like hungry cranes, crying flill, I want, 1 want,!( s )(ever craving, wilfully wafting, till all be brought *oidoleful difli of delolation, and with cleannefs of teeth,'a full breaft, an empty belly, big pockets without(pence, pinching penury, perfect poverty, drouth, hun-iger, want of money and friends both, old age, dim(eyes, feeble joints, without fhoes or deaths, the realfruits of a bad marriage, which brings thoughtlefs■Fops to both faith and repentance in one day.Thirdly, Another thing I fee, hear, and cannot(help, is the breeding of bairns and bringing them, upHike bill-ftirks, they gie them wealth of meat, but no.manners; but when I was a bairn, if I did not bend:to obedience, I ken myfel what I got^ which learnedtme what to gi’ mine again ; if they had tell’d me tutslor prute-no, I laid them o’er my knee and a corn’dcrack for crack o’er their hurdies like a knock bleach¬ing a barn-web, till the red wats flood on their hips,jthis brought obedience into my houfe, and banifh’didods and ill-nature out at the door ; I dang the de’ilt»’ them, and dadded them like a wet difh-clout tillhey did my bidding : But now the bairns are broughtip to fpit fire in their mithers’ face, and c^ift dirt atItheir auld daddies ; How can they be good who ne-iver faw a fample of it ? or reverence old age, wrhorpraftifed no precepts in their youth ? How can theyllove their parents who gave them black poiton ififteadiof good principles ? Who {hewed them no good, noritaught them no duties ? No marvel fucli childrendefpife old age, and reverence their parents as an oldihorie does his father.Fourthly, The laft prevailing evil which I fee, allimen may hear, but none drive to help, the banifh-iment of that noble holy-day, called the Sabbath, which(has been blafted by a whirl-wind from the fouth ; Iam yet alive, who Taw this hurricane coming thro’ the■walled city near Solway in the South ; it being on a(Sunday, and a beautiful fun-ihine day amangft fomeifoul weeks in harveft weather, which caufed the LordMayor of that place work hard and put in the whole(fields of wheat harveft, and the priefts of that church* commended him therefore ■, bccuufetL. leau:; wasback-( 6 )ward, why fliould not men be difobedient ? And thi |infe£Uon is come here alfo, furely the lofs of this Sab|bath-day will he counted a black Saturday to fome lwhen I walk in the fields, I know it not but by the ftopjping of the plow, when in the city only by the cloltlnefs of a few ftiop-doors and the found of the bells Hdegenerate ideas of religion indeed ! when the bigl|praife is founded only by bell metal. A founding hr of.\and a tinkling cymbal, is it not come to pafs, the tavernroar like ^Etna’s mouth ; children follow their gaming, and old finners their ftrolling about, nothing flop'but coal-carfs and common carriers, tee Sabbath laltflno longer than the fermon, and the fermon is mealfured by a little fand in a glafs ! many, too many fre¬quent the church, feemingly only to Ihow their antic-drefs, with heads of a monitrous form, more furprifingthan thofe defcribed by Arillotle, as for length ex-„ needing that of an afles head, ears and all, and ah ho1*bumbling would it be to fee their heads ftruck into;fuch forms, ,&c.They difdain now to ride on pads as of old, or to behobled on a horfe’s hurdles, but mull be hurled berhind the tail, fafely feated in a leather conveniency,and there they lly fwiftly as in the chariot of Amina-d,ib.Thsy will not fpeak the mother language of their|native country, but muft have fouthren oaths, refinedilike raw fugar thro’ the mills of curling, finely poll fir-,ed and fairly ftruck in the profane mint of London, in¬to a perfect form of flunkey-language ; even the verywild Arabs from the mountain tops, who have notyet got Englilh to profane his Maker’s name, will cryCot, Cot; hateful it is to hear them fwear, who can¬not fpeak, O ! ftrange alteration fince the days of old,the downfal of Popery and the Prelates decay, whenreformation was alive, and'religion in tafte andfalhion ;the people during the Sabbath, were all packed up inclofets, and their children kept within doors, when e-vcry city appeared as a fanftuary, nothing to be heard 1in the ftreets but the found of prayer on the right hand, 1;jnd the melodious found of pfalms on the left.< 7 )] Now is the days of counting, fcribing, riding of hor-lib, and the found of the poft-horn come ; furely thereWill be trade now, and none will mifs profperity, whenJvery day is fair; I add no more on this head, bu< e-lery one claim a right to his own fet time, &c.1 Another grievance of the female offenders I cannot'•mit, which attracts man’s fancy and is the caufe ofjiis fall; I mean Flighters who have got a little of themeans of Mammon, more filver than lenfe, more gold;han good nature, haughtinefs for humility, valueihemfelves as a treafure incomprehenfible, their headsnd heart of Ophir-gold, their hips of filver, and theirphole body as fet about with precious {tones, great andiiany are the congreffesof their courtfliip, and the fo-hmnizing of their marriage is like the conclufion of aieace after a bloody and tedious war.i And what is fhe after all, yea her poor penny will'ever be exhaufted, it mult be laid out in lunacy andhzinefs, flie muft have teas and the tuther thing:^hen pregnancy and thefpueing of porich approaches,Ineivfhe prophecies of her death ; as fhe hatches life,re embraces lazinefs ; then O the bed, the bed, no-iing like the bed for a bad wife ; her body becomess par-boil’d being fo bed-ridden, this rots their chii-iren in the brewing, and buries them in the bringingp, yea feme mothers are fo beaftly, as to water thejed and blame the child therefore ; yetfuch lazy wivesve long, and their children foon die ; their far fetch-J feigned ficknefs foon render the hufband to theubitance of one fixpence, he becomes poor and hen-jeck’t under fuch petticoat government.I But when"!

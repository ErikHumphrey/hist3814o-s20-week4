let us bound to Glen-Lyon away.”Stern scowl’d the Macgregor, then silent andsullen,He turn’d his red eye to the braes of Strathfillan ;‘ Go, Malcolm, to sleep, let the clans be dismissed:The Campbells this night for Macgregor must rest.’“ Macgregor, Macgregor, our scouts have beenflying,Three days, round the hills of M’Nab and Glen-Lyon ;Of riding and running such tidings they bear.We must meet them at home, else they’ll quicklybe here.’’13‘ The Campbell may come, as his promises bindhim.And naughty M’Nab, with his giants behind him »This night I am bound to relinquish the liay.And do what is freezes my vitals to say.Forgive me, dear brother, this horror of mind;Thou knowest in the strife I was never behind.Nor ever receded a foot from the van.Or blenched at the ire or the prowess of man.But Tve sworn by the cross, by my God, and byall!An oath which I cannot, and dare not recall.—Ere the shadows of midnight fall east from the pile,To meet with a spirit this night in Glen-Gyle.’* Last night, in my chamber, all thoughtful andlone,I called to remembrance some deeds I had done,When entered a lady, with visage so wan.And looks such as never was fasten’d on man.1 knew her, O brother ! 1 knew her full well !Of that once fair dame such a tale 1 could tellAs would thrill thy bold heart; but how long sheremain’d.So rack’d was my heart, and my bosorn so pain'd,1 knew not—but ages seem'd short to the while.Though, proffer the Highlands, nay, all the greenisle, *With length of existence no man can enjoy,The same to endure, the dread proffer I’d fly !The thrice-threaten'd pangs of last night to forego,Macgregor would dive to the mansions belowDespairing and mad, to futurity blind,The present to shun, and some respite to find,I swore ere the shadow fell east from the pile.To meet her alone by the brook of Glen-Gyle.’‘ She told me, and turn'd my chil'd heart to astone.The glory and name of Macgregor was gone:That the pine, which for ages had shed a brighthaloAfar on the mountains of Highland Glen-Falo,Should wither and fall ere the turn of yon moon,Smit through by the canker of hated Colquhoun :That a feast on Macgregors each day should be com¬mon.For years, to the eagles of Lennox and Lomond.’“ A parting embrace, in one momont, she gave:Her breath was a furnace, her bosom the grave !Then flitting elusive, she said, with a frown.The mighty Macgregor shall yet be my own !““ Macgregor, thy fauces are wild as the wind 5The dreams of the night have disorder'd thy mind.15Come, buckle thy panoply—march to the field.—-See, brother, how hack‘d are thy helmet and shield.Ay, that was M‘Nab, in the height ofhis pride.When the lions of Dochart stood firm by his side.I This night the proud chief his presumption shallrue;Rise, brother, these chinks in his heart-blood willglue :Thy fantacies frightful shall Hit on the wing,When load with thy bugle Glen-Lyon shall ring.’’Like glimpse of the moon through the storm olthe nightMacgregor’s red eye shed one sparkle of light:It faded—it darkened—he shudder’d—he sigh’d,‘ No ! not for the universe !’ low he replied.Away went Macgregor, but went not aloneTo watch the dread rendezvous, Malcolm has gone.They oarcd the broad Lomond, so still and serene !And deep in her bosom, how awful the scene !0‘er mountains inverted the blue waters curl'd.And rock'd them on skies of a far nether world.All silent they went, for the time was approaching .The moon the blue zenith already was touching;No foot was abroad on the forest or hill.No sound but the lullaby sung by the rill1GYoung Malcolm at distance, couch'd, tremblingthe while,Macgregor stood lone by the brook of Glen-Gyle.Few minutes had pass'd, ere they spied on thestream,A skiff sailing light, where a lady did seemHer sail was the web of the gossamer’s loom.The glow-worm her wake-light, the rainbow herboom ;A dim rayless beam was her prow and her mast.Like wold-fire, at midnight, that glares on the wasteThough rough was the river with rock and cascade.No torrent, no rock her velocity staid ;She wimpled the water to weather and’fee,And heav’d as if borne on the waves of the sea.Mute nature was rous’d in the bounds of the glen ;The wild deer of Gairtney abandon’d his den.Fled panting away over river and isle.Nor once turned his eye to the brook of Glen-Gyle.The fox fled in terror, the eagle awoke,As slumbering he doz’d in the shelve of the rock;Astonish’d, to hide in the moon-beam he flew.And screw’d the night-heaven till lost in the blue.Young Malcolm beheld the pale lady approach,The chieftain salute her, and shrink from her toucliHe saw the Macgregor kneel down on the plain,17As begging for something he could not obtain ;She rais’d him indignant, derided his stay,Then bore him on hoard, set her sail, and a way.'Though fast the red bark down the river did glide.Yet faster ran Malcolm adown by its side;* Macgregor ! Macgregor !’ he bitterly cried ;‘ Macgregor ! Macgregor !’ the echoes replied.He struck at the lady, but, strange though it seem.His sword only fell on the rocks and the stream ;But the groans from the boat, that ascended amain,Were groans from a bosom in horror and pain,—They reach’d the dark lake, and bore lightly away ;Macgregor is vanish d for ever and aye!THE DYIMG CHRISTIAN TO HIS SOUL.Vital spark of heavenly flame !Quit, oh quit this mortal frame:Trembling, hoping, lingering, flying,Oh the pain, the bliss of dying !Cease, fond Nature, cease thy strife.And let me languish into life !Hark ! they whisper—angles say,“ Sister spirit, come away”—What is this absorbs me quite !Steals my senses, shuts my sight.18Drowns my spirits, draws my breath !Tell me, my soul, can this be—deathThe world recedes ! it disappears IHeaven opens to my eyes !—my earsWith sounds seraphic ring !Lend, lend your wings ; I mount! I flyO Grave ! where is thy victory ?O Death ! where is thy sting PTHE ladies’ PETITION TO DOCTEH MOYES.Dear Doctor ! let it not transpire.How much your lectures we admire;How at your eloquence we wonder.When you explain the cause of thunder.Of lightning, and of electricity.With so much plainness and simplicity:The origin of rocks and mountains.Of seas and rivers, lakes and fountains.Of rain and hail, and frost and snow,‘ And all the winds and storms that blow ;Besides an hundred wonders more,Of which we never heard before.But now, dear Docter ! not to flatter,There is a most important matter,—A matter which you never touch on,—lt>A matter which our thoughts run much on ;A subject, if we right conjecture.Which well deserves a long, long lecture,Wrhich all the ladies would approve,-—The natural history of Love.O list’ to our united voice.Deny us not, dear Docter Moyes !Tell us why our poor tender heartsSo willingly admit Love’s dartsTeach us the marks of Love’s beginning ;What is it makes a beau so winning,What makes us think a coxcomb wittyA dotard wise, a red coat pretty:Why we believe such horrid lies,—That we are angles from the skies ;Our teeth are pearl, our cheeks are roses;Our eyes are stars ; such charming noses;Explain our dreams, waking aud sleeping ;Explain our laughing and our weeping;Explain our hoping and our doubting,Our blushing, simpering, and pouting ;Teach us all the enchanting artsOf winning, and of keeping hearts :Teach us, dear Doctor ! if you can.To humble that proud creature, Man ;To turn the wise ones into fools.The proud and insolent to tools ;To make them all run helter-skelter,Their necks into the marriage halter ;20Then leave us to ourselves with these.We’ll rule and turn them as we please.Dear Doctor ! if you grant our wishes.We promise you five hundred kisses ;And rather than th’ affair he blundered.We’ll give you six score to the hundred.A BETH GELERT.The spearman heard the bugle sound,And cheerly smilled the morn.And many a brach, and many a hound,Attend Llewellyn’s horn :And still he blew a louder blast,And gave a louder cheer ;Come Gelert! why art thou the lastLlewellyn’s horn to hear?Oh, where does faithful Geiert roam ?The flower of all his race !So true, so brave,—a lamb at home,A lion n the chase !”’Twas only at Llewellyn’s hoardThe faithful Gelert fed ;He wmtch’d, he served, he cheer’d his lord,And sentintTd his bed,21In sootli, he was a peerless hound.The gift of royal John ;But now no Gelert could be found,And all the chase rode on.An now, as over rocks and dellsI he gallant chidings rise.All Snowdon’s craggy chaos yells.With many mingled cries.That day Llewellyn little lovedIhe chase of hart or hare,And scant and small the booty proved,tor Gelert was not there.Unpleased, Llewellyn homeward hied.When, near the portal seat,His truant, Gelert, he espied.Bounding his lord to greet.But when he gain’d his castle door.Aghast the chieftain stood ;The hound was smear’d with gouts of gore.His lips and fangs ran blood !Llewellyn gazed with wild surprise.Unused such looks to meet;His favourite check’d his joyful guise.And crouch’d and lick’d his feet.22Onward in haste Llewellyn pass’d,(And on went Gelert too,)And still, where’er his eyes were cast,Fresh blood-gouts shock’d his view !O’erturn’d his infant’s Led, he found.The blood-stain’d covert rent,And, all around, the walls and groundWith recent blood besprent.He call’d his child—no voice replied :He search’d—with terror wild ;Blood ! blood ! he found on every side.But no where found the child !“ Hell-hound ! by thee my child’s devour’dThe frantic father cried, • 'And to the hilt his vengeful swordHe plunged in Gelert’s side !His suppliant, as to earth he fell.No pity could impart;But still his Gelert’s dying yellPass’d heavy o’er his heart.Aroused by Gelert’s dying yell.Some slumberer waken’d nigh ;What words the parent’s joy can tell.To hear his infant cry !23%Conceal’d benealli a mangled heap,His hurried search had miss’d.All glowing from his rosy sleep.His cherub hoy he kiss’d INor scratch had he, nor harm nor dreadBut the same couch beneath.Lay a great wolf, all torn and dead—Tremendous still in death !Ah ! what was then Llewellyn’s pain !For now the truth was clear;The gallant hound the wolf had slain,To save Llewellyn’s heir.Vain, vain was all Llewellyn’s woe:“ Best of thy kind, adieu !The frantic deed which laid thee low,This heart shall ever rue l”And now a gallant tomb they raise.With costly sculpture deck’d;And marbles, storied with his praise.Poor Gelert’s bones protect.Here never could the spearmen pass,Or forester, unmoved ;Here oft the tear-bespringled grassLlewellyn’s sorrow proved.24And hear he hung his horn and spear;And, oft as evening fell,In Fancy’s piercing sounds would hearPoor Gelert’s dying yell!there’s scarlet tae ye noo !A Highlander entered a haberdasher’s shop inDundee, some time ago, and asked for a piece ofscarlet cloth to make him a waistcoat. The rusticmanners of the Gael set some young women whowere at the counter a giggling; and the shopmanwilling to afford them sport, began to play of hissmall wit upon the stranger. “ So goodman, yewant a piece of scarlet ? Would you know a pieceof scarlet if ye saw it?” “ I think I wood,” re¬plied the Mountaineer. The shopman threw downa piece of blue cloth : ‘ Is that scarlet ?’ ‘ Hoot,no, no! that no be it.’ A piece of green cloth wasproduced ; the same question was repeated and re¬ceived a similar answer,—to the great amusementof the querist and his female friends, who were atno pains to conceal their mirth. The Highlandertook revenge in his own way: He put his nose tothe cloth, and affected to judge of the colour by thesmell. The shopman, at his request, did the same;but the instant he bent his nose towards the coun¬ter, the Highlandman siezed him by the ears andmade his nasal protuberance come in such violent icontact with the boards that the blood sprung from (it. ‘ Tat,’ said the Highlander, is the colour io’ scarlet tae ye noo, ladand coolly walked aWy.FINIS,

THOMAS PERCY, BISHOP OF DROMORB.GLASGOW:FEINTED FOR THE BOOKSELLERS.HTa oHERMIT OF WARKWORTH.PART FIRSTDark was the night, and wild the sterm,And loud the torrent’s roar;And loud the sea was heard to dashAgainst the distant shore.Musing on man’s weak hapless state.The lonely hermit lay;When, lo! he heard a female voiceLament in sore dismay.With hospitable haste h« rose,And wak’d his sleeping fire;And snatching up a lighted brand,Forth hied the reverend sire.All sad beneath a neighbouring tre',A beauteous maid he found,Who beat her breast, and with her tearsBedew’d the mossy ground.O weep not, lady, weep not so,Nor let vain fears alarm;My little cell shall shelter thee.And keep thee safe from barm.It is not for myself I weep,Nor for myself I fear;But for my dear and only friend,Who lately left me here.And while some sheltering bower he sought,Within this lonely wood,Ah! sore 1 fear his wandering feetHave slipped in yonder flood.O trust in Heaven, the hermit said,And lo my cell repair;Doubt not hut I shall find thy friend,And case thee of thy care.Then climbing up his rocky stairs.He srales the clifl so high,And calls aloud, and waves his lightTo guide the stranger’s eye.Among the thickets long he winds,With careful steps and slow :At length a voice returned his call,Quick answering from btlow:AO tell me, father, tell me true>If you have chanc’d to seeA gentle maid 1 lately leftBeneath some neighbouring tree.But either I have lost the place.Or she has gone astray :And much I fear this fatal streamHas snatch’d her hence away.Praise Heaven, my son, the hermit said.The lady’s safe and well:And soon he join’d the wandering youth,And brought him to his cell.Then well was seen these gentle friends,They lov’d each other dear :The youth he press’d her to his heart;Tlie maid let fall a (ear.Ah! seldom had their host, I ween,Beheld so sweet a pair:'The youth was tall, with manly bloom.She, slender, soft, and fair.The youth was clad in forest green,With bugle-horn so bright:She in a silken robe and scarf,Snatch’d up in hasty flight.Sit down, my children, says the sage}Sweet rest your limbs require;Then heaps fresh fuel on (he hearth,And mends his little fire.Partake, he said, my simple store,Dried fruits, and milk, and curds}And spreading all upon the board,Invites with kindly words.Thanks, father, for thy bounteous fare.The youthful couple say;Then freely ate, and made good cheer,And talk’d their cares away.Now say, my children (for perchanceMy counsel may avail)What strange adventure brought you hereWithin this lonely dale;First tell me, father, said the youth,(Nor blame mine eager tongue)What town is here? What lands are theseAnd to what lord belong’bAla*! my son, the hermit said.Why do I live to say,Tlie rightful lord of these domainsIs banish’d far away!Ten winters now have shed their snowsOn this my lowly hall,Since valiant Hotspur (so the NorthOur youthful lord did call)Against fourth Henry BolingbrokeLed up his northern powers,And stoutly fighting lost his lifeNear proud Salopia’s towers.Oi:c son he left, a lovely hoy,His country’s hope and heir ;And oh! to save him from his foe*It was his grandsire’s care.In Scotland safe he plac’d the childBeyond the reach of strife.Not long before the brave old EarlAt Bramham lost his life.And now the Percy name, so longOur northern pride and boast,Lies hid, alas ! beneath a cloud;Their honours reft and lost.No chieftain of that noble houseNow leads our youth to arms ;The bordering Scots despoil our fields.And ravage all our farms.Their halls and castles, once so fair,Now moulder in decay ;Proud strangers now usurp their lands,And bear their wealth away.Not far from hence, where yon full streamRuns winding down the lea,Fair Warkworth lifts her lofty towers,And overlooks the sea.These towers, alas ! now stand forlorn,With noisome weeds o’erspread ;Where teasted lords and courtly dames,And where the poor were fed.Meantime, far off, ’midst Scottish hills,The Percy lives unknown :On stranger’s bounty he depends.And may not claim his own.GO might I with these aged eyes,But live to see him heie,Then should my soul depart in bliss?—He said, and dropt a tear.And is the Percy still so lov’dOf all his friends and thee ’Then bless me, father, said the youth,For 1, thy guest am he.Silent he gaz’d, then turn’d asideTo wipe the tears he shed ;And lifting up his hands and eyes,Pour’d blessings on his headWelcome, our dear and much lov’d lord.Thy country’s hope and care;But who may this young lady be.That is so wonderous fair ?Now, father, listen to my tale,And thou shall know the truth;Aud let thy sage advice dire<tMy ine*perienc’d youth.In Scotland I’ve been nobly bredBeneath the Regent’s hand, (1)In feats of arms and every loreTo fit me for command.With fond impatience long 1 burn’d.My native land to see ;At length 1 won my guardian friendTo yield that boon to me.Then up and down in hunter’s garbI wander’d as in chase.Till in the noble Neville’s house (2)1 gain’d a hunter’s place.Some time w ith him 1 liv’d unknownTill I'd the hap so rare,To please this young and gentle dame,That baron’s daughter fair.Now, Percy, said tlie blushing ma’d.The truth I must reveal;Souls great and generous, like to thine.Their ’noble deeds conceal.It happened on a summer’s day,Led by the fragrant breeze,I wander’d forth to take the airAmong the green-wood trees.7Sudden a liand of rugged Seo!«,That near in ambush lay,Moss-troopers from the border sate,There seiz’d me for their prey.My shrieks had long been spent in vain.But Heaven, that saw my grief,Brought this brave youth within my call,Who flew to my relief.With nothing but his hunting-spear,And dagger in his hand,He sprung like lightning on my foes,And caus’d them soon to stand.He fought till more assistance came;The Scots were overthrown ;Thus freed me captive from their bandsTo make me more his own.0 happy day! the youth replied :Bless’d were the wounds 1 bare!From that fond hour she deign’d to smile.And listen to my prayer.And when she knew my name and birth.She vow’d to be my bride;But oh! we fear’d (alas! the while)Her princely mother’s pride:Sister of haughty Bolingbroke, (3''Our house’s ancient foe,To me 1 thought a banish’d wightCould ne’er such favour show.Despairing then to gain consentAt length to fly with me,1 won this lovely timorous maid,To Scotland bound are we.This evening, as the night drew on,Fearing we were pursued,We turn’d adown the right-hand path,And gain’d this lonely wood:Then lighting from our weary steedsTo shun the pelting shower.We met thy kind conducting hand,And reach’d this friendly bower.Now rest ye both, the hermit said;Awhile your cares forego :Nor, lady, scorn my humble bed,—We’ll pass the night lielow. (4)THE HERMIT OF WARKWORTH.PART SECOND.I.oyfxy smil’d the blushing mom,And every storm was fled :But lovelier far, with sweeter smile,Fair .Eleanor left her bed.She found her Henry all alone,And cheer’d him with her sight;The youth consulting with his friend,Had watch’d the livelong night.What sweet surprise o’erpower’d her brewt fHer cheeks what bitches dy’d !When fondly he besought her thereTo yield to be his bride!Within this lonely hermitageThere is a chapel meet:Then grant, dear maid, my fond request.And make my bliss complete.O Henry! when thou deign’st to sue,Can 1 thy suit withstand ?When thou, lov’d youth, bast won my heart.Can I refuse my hand ?For thee I left a father’s smiles,And mother’s tender care ;And whether weal or woe betide,Thy lot I mean to share.And wilt thou then, O generous maid 1Such matchless favour show,To share with me, a banish’d wight,My peril, pain, or woe ?Now Heaven, 1 trust, bath joys in store,To crown thy constant breast;For know, fond hope assures my heartThat we shall soon be blest.Not far from hence stands Coquet Isle,Surrounded by the sea, (5)There dwells a holy friar, well knownTo all thy friends and thee:Ti, father Bernard, so reveredFor every worthy deed,To Baby Castle he shall go,And for us kindly plead.To fetch this good and holy man,And soouj I trust, his pious hand*Will join us both m one.Thus (hey in sweet and tender talkThe lingeriag hours beguile;At length they see the hoary sageCome from the neighbouring isle.With pious joy and wonder mix’d,He greets the noble pair,And glad consents to join their hands,With many a fervent prayer.Then straight to Raby’s distant walls.He kindly wends his way ;Meantime in love and dalliance sweet,They spend the livelong day.And now, attended by their host,The hermitage they view’d,Deep hewn within a craggy cliff,And overhung with w ood.And near a flight of shapeless steps,All cut with nicest skill.And piercing through a stony arch,Ran winding up the bid.There deck’d with many a flower and herb,His little garden stands ;With fruitful trees in shady rows,All planted by his hands.Then scoop’d within the solid rock,Three sacred vaults he shows ;The chief a chapel neatly arch’d,On branching columns rose.Each proper ornament w as there,That should a chapel grace 5The lattice for confession fram’d.And holy water vase.O’er either door a sacred textInvites to godly fear;And in a little ’scutcheon hungThe cross, the crown, and spear.Up to the altar’s ample breadthTwo easy steps amend :And near a gliimsierk* «jssan '%iTwo well-wros$}ii •T'serfm i e*.Besjde the altar rose a laanAll in the living stone t410On which a young and beauteous maidIn goodly sculpture shone.A kneeling angel, fairly carv’d,Lean’d hov’ring o’er her breast;A weeping warrior at her feet;And near to these her crest. (6)The cliff, the vault, but chief the tomb,Attract the wond’ring pair:Eager they ask what hapless dameI ies sculptur’d here so fair.The hermit sigh’d, the hermit wept,For sorrow scarce could speak ;At length he wip’d the trickling tear#‘That all bedew’d his cheek:Alas! my children, human lifeIs but a vale of woe;And very mournful is the tale,Which ye so fain would know.THE HERMIT’S TALE.Young lord, thy grandsire had a friendIn days of youthful fame ;Yon distant hills were his domains:Sir Bertram was his name.Where’er the noble Percy fought,His friend was at his side ;And many a skirmish with the ScotsTheir early valour tried.Young Bertram lov’d a beauteous maid.As fair as fair might be;The dew-drop on the lily’s cheekWas not so fair as she.Fair Widdrington the maiden’s name.Yon towers her dwelling-place; (7)Her sire an old Northumbrian chiefDevoted to thy race.Many a lord and many a knight.To this fair damsel came :But Bertram uas her only choice,For him she felt a flame.Lord Percy pleaded for his friend,Her father soon consents;None but the beauteous maid herselfHis wishes now prevents.11But she with studied fond delaysDefers ihe blissful hour;And loves to try his constancy,And prove her maiden power.That heart, she said, is lightly pi i*’dW hlch is too lightly won ; ’And long shall rue that easy maid,V\ ho yields her love too soon.Lord Percy made a solemn feastIn Alnwick’s princely hall;And there came lo.ds, and there came knights,His chiefs and barons all.With wassail, mirth, and revelry,The castle rung around :Lord Percy call’d for song and harp,And pipes of martial sound.The minstrels of thy noble house.All clad in robes of blue,With silver crescents on their arms.Attend m order due.The great achievements of thy raceThey sung: their high command :How valiant Manifred o’er the seas“ First led his northern band.“ ®rfJe Galfred next to NormandywIlh venturous Rolla came ;“ And from his Norman castles won,“ Assum’d the Percy name. (8)I hey sung, how in the conqueror’s fleet“ Lord William shipp’d his powers,And gam’d a fair young Saxon brideV\ ith all her lands and towei-s. (9)“ 'rhre" journeying to the Holy Land,p ^here bravely fought and died ;.But first the silver ciescent wan,“ Some Paynim Soldan’s pride.“ They sung how Agnes, beauteous heir,The queen’s own broihcr wed,“ Lord Joeeline, sp, ung from Charlemagne,In princely Brabant bred. (10)“ How he the Percy name reviv’d,“ And how his noble line,“ Still foremost in their country’s cause,“ With godlike ardour shine I”12With loud acclaims the listening crowdApplaud the master’s song,And deeds of arms and war becameThe theme of every tongue.Now high heroic acts they tell,Their perils past recall;When, lo! a damsel, young and fair,Stepp’d forward through the hall.She Bertram courteously address'd ;And kneeling on her knee,—Sir knight, the lady of thy loveHath sent this gift to thee.Then forth she drew a glitt’ring helm ,Well plated many a fold,The casque was wrought of temper’d steel,The crest of burnish’d gold.Sir knight, thy lady sends thee this,And yields to be thy bride,When thou hast prov’d this maiden giftWhere sharpest blows are tried.Young Bertram took the shining helme,And thrice he kiss’d the same;Trust me, I’ll prove this precious casqueWith deeds of noblest fame.Lord Percy and his barons boldThen fix upon a day,To scour the marches, late oppress’d,And Scottish wrongs repay.The knights assembled on the hills,A thousand horse and moreBrave Widdrington, tho’ sunk in years,The Percy standard bore.Tweed’s limpid current soon they pass.And range the borders round •,Down the green slopes of TiviotdaleTheir bugle-horns resound.As when the lion in his denHath heard the hunter’s cries.And rushes forth to meet his foes,So did the Douglas rise.Attendant on their chief’s commandA thousand warriors wait:And now'the fatal hour drew onOf cruel keen debate.' .IdA chosen troop of Scottish youtli*Advanc’d before the rest;Lord Percy mark’d their gallant mien.And thus his friend address’d :Now, Bertram, prove thy lady’s helmeAttack yon forward band jDead or alive I’ll rescue thee,Or perish by their hand.Young Bertram bow’d with glad assentAnd spurr’d bis eager steed,And calling on his lady’s name,Rush’d forth with whirlwind speed.As when a grove of sapling oaksThe livid lightning rends ;So fiercely ’mid the opposing ranks,*. Sir Bertram’s, sword descends.This way and that he drives the steeAnd keenly pierces through ;And many a tall and comely knightWith furious force he slew.Now closing fast on every side,They hem Sir Bertram round :But dauntless he repels their rage,And deals forth many a wound.The vigour of his single armHad w ell nigh won the field ;When ponderous fell a Scottish axiAnd clove his lifted shield.Another blow his temples took,And reft his helme in twain ;That beauteous helme, his lady’s gif.—— His blood bedew’d the plain.Lord Pei cy saw his champion fallAmid the unequal fight:And now, my noble friends, he said,Let’s save this gallant knight.Then rushing in, with uplift shield,He o’er the warrior hung;As some fierce eagle spreads her wingTo guard her callow young.Three times they strove to seize their preyThree times they quick retire :What force could stand his furious stroke.Or meet his martial fire!14Now gathering round on every part.The battle rag’d amain ;And many a lady wept her lord,That hour untimely slain.Percy and Douglas, great in arms,There all their courage >howed ;And all the field was strew'd with dead,And all with crimson flowed.At length the glory of the dayThe Scots reluctant yield;And after wond’rous valour shown,They slowly quit the field.All pale extended on their shields,And weltering in his gore.Lord Percy’s knights their bleeding friendTo Wark's fair castle bore.(ll)Well hast thou earn’d my daughter’s love.Her fathrr kindly said :And she herself shall dress thy wounds.And tend thee in thy bed.A message went ; no maiden came;Fair Isabel ne’er appears :Beshrew me, Said the aged chief.Young maidens have their fears.Cheer up, my son, thou shall her see,So soon as thou canst ride :And she shall nurse thee in her bower,And she shall be thy bride.Sir Bertram a’, her name reviv’d,He bless’d the soothing sound ;Fond hope supply’d the nurse’s care,And heal’d his ghastly wound.THE HERMIT OF WARE WORT II.PART THIRDOne early mom, while dewy dropsHung trembling on the tree,Sir Bertram .from his sick-bed rose,His bride he would go see.A brother he had in prime of youth,Of courage firm and keen,And he would tend him on the way,Because his wounds were green.15All clay oVt moss and moor they rode,By many a lonely tower ;And ’twas the dew-fall of the nightEre they drew near her bower.Most drear and dark the castle seem'd,That wont to shine so bright}And long and loud Sir Bertram call'dEre he beheld a light.At length her aged nurse arose,With voice so sin ill and clear ;What wight is this that calls so loud,And knocks so boldly here?’Tis Bertram calls, thy lady’s love,Come from his bed of care:All day I’ve ridden o’er moor and mossTo see thy lady fair.Now out, alas! (she loudly shriek'd)Alas ! how may this be ?For six long days are gone and pastSince she set out to thee.Sad terror seiz’d Sir Bertram’s heart,And ready was to fall;When now the drawbridge was let down.And gates were open’d all.Six days, young knight, are past and goneSince she set out to thee;And sure, if no sad harm had happ’d,Long since thou wouldst her see.For when the heard thy grievous chance,She tore her hair and cried,Alas! I’ve slain the comelicst knight,All through my foolish pride!And now to atone for my sad fault,And his dear health regain,I’ll go myself, and nurse my love,And soothe his bed of pain.Then mounted she her milk-white steedOne morn at break of day ;And two tall yeomen went with herTo guard her on the way.Sad terror smote Sir Bertram’s heart.And grief o’erwhelm’d his mind ;Trust me, said he, I ne’er will costTdl 1 thy lady find.16That night he spent in sorrow and care,And with sad boding heart,Or ere the dawning of the day,His brother and he depart.Now, brother, we’ll our ways divide.O’er Scottish hills to range:Do thou go north, and I’ll go west;And all our dress we’K change.Some Scottish carle hath seiz’d my love,And borne her to his den ;And ne’er will I tread English groundTill she’s restor’d again.Tire brothers straiglit their paths divideO’er Scottish hills to range:And hide themselves in quaint disguise,And oft their dress they change.Sir Bertram clad in gown of grey,Most like a palmer poor,To halls and castles wanders round,And begs from door to door,Sometimes a minstrel’s garb he wears,With pipes so sweet and shrill;And wends to every tower and town,O’er ev’ry dale and hill.One day as he sat under a thorn,All sunk in deep despair,An aged pilgrim pass’d him by,Who mark’d his face of care.All minstrels yet lhat e’er I saw,Are full of game and glee,But thou art sad and woe-begone,1 marvel whence it be.Father, I serve an aged lord,Whose griefs afflict my mind,His only child is stolen away,And fain 1 would her find.Cheer up, my son ; perchance, he said.Some tidings I may bear :For oft when human hopes have fail’d.Then heavenly comfort’s near.Behind yon hills so steep and high,Down m a lonely glen,There stands a castle fair and strong.Far from the abode of men.17As late I chanc’d to crave an alms.About this evening hour,Me-thought I heard a lady’s voiceLamenting in the tower.\nd when I asked what harm had happ’d.What lady sick there lay ?Tltey rudely drove me from the gate,And bade me wend away.These tidings caught Sir Bertram’s ear,He thank’d him for his tale;And soon lie hasten’d o’er the hilU,And soon he reach’d the vale.Then drawing near those lonely toweis,Which stood in Dale so low,And sitting down beside the gate,His pipes he ’gan to blow.Sir Porter, is thy lord at home,To hear a minstrel's song ?Or may I crave a lodging liere,Without offence or wrong ?My lord, he said, is not at home,To hear a minstrel’s song:And should I lend thee lodging here.My life would not belong.He play’d again so soft a strain,Such power sweet sounds impart,He won the churlish porter’s ear,And mov’d his stubborn heart.Minstrel, he said, thou play’st so sweet,Fair entrance thou shouldst win ;But, alas! I’m sworn upon the rood.To let. no stranger in.Yet, minstrel, in yon rising cliff,Thou’lt find a sheltering cave ;And here thou shatt my supper share.And there thy lodging have.All day he sits beside the gate,And pipes both loud and clear;All night he watches round the walls,In hope’s hialove to hear.The first night, as he silent watch’d,All at the midnight hour,He plainly heard his lady’s voiceLamenting iu the tower.IfcThe seeaftd night Hie .noon shone cleat,And gilt the spangled dew ;He saw his lady through the grate,But ’twas a transient view.The third night, wearied out, he sleptTill near the morning tide ;When, starting up, he seiz’d his swordAnd to the castle hied.Wrhen, lo! he saw a ladder of ropesDepending from the wall;And o’er the moat was newly laidA poplar strong and tall.And soon he saw his love descend,Wrapt in a tartan plaid ;Assisted by a sturdy youthIn Highland garb yclad.Amaz’d, confounded at the sight,He lay unseen and still;And soon he saw them cross the stream.And mount the neighbouring hill.Unheard, unknown to all within,The youthful couple fly,But what can ’scape the lover’s ken,Or shun his piercing eye ?With silent step he follows closeBehind the flying pair,And saw her hang upon his armWith fond familiar air.Thanks, gentle youth, she often said,My thanks thou well hast won ;For me what wiles hast thou contriv’d!For me what dangers run!And ever shall my grateful heartThy services repay :—Sir Bertram would no further hear.But cried, “ Vile traitor, stay ' '“ Vile traitor, yield that lady up .'And quick his sword he drew; fThe stranger turn’d in sudden rage.And at Sir Bertram flew.With mortal hate their vigorous arm*Gave many a vengeful blow;But Bertram’s stronger hand prevail’d,1'And laid the stranger low.19Die, irauor, die —A deadly tlinmAttends each furious word;Ah! then fair Isabel knew his voice,And rush’d beneath his sword.O stop, she cried, O stop thy arm!Thou dost Ihy brother slay!—And here the hermit paus’d and wept JHis tongue no more could say.At length he cried—Ye lovely pair,How shall I tell the rest?Ere I could stop my piercing sword,It fell and stahb’d her breast!Wert thou thyself that hapless youth?Ah! cruel fate! they said—The hermit wept, and so did they;They sigh’d; he hung his head.0 blind and jealous rage, he cried,What evils from thee flow !The hermit paus’d; they silent mount’dHe wept, and they were woe.Ah! when I heard my brother’s name,I saw my lady bleed,1 rav’d, I wept, I curs’d my armThat wrought the fatal deed.In vain I clasp’d her to my breast,And clos’d the ghastly wound;In vain I press’d his bleeding corpse,And rais’d it from the ground.My brother, alas! spake never more;His precious life was down,She kindly strove to soothe my pain,Regardless of her own.Bertram, she said, be comforted,And live to think on me:May we in heaven that union prove.Which here was not to be !Bertram, she said, J still was true!Thou only hadst my heart:May we hereafter meet in bliss !We now, alas! must part.For ihee I left my father’s hall,And dew to thy relief;When, lo ! near Cheviot’s fatal hillsI met a Scottish chief.20LordJVIalcolm’s itii, whose proffer’d love1 had refused with scorn;He slew ray guards and seiz’d on meUpon that fatal morn ;And in these dreary, hated walls,He kept me close confin’d;And fondly sued and warmly press’dTo win me to his mind.Each rising mom increas’d my pain,Each night increas’d my fear;When wand’ring in this northern garbThy brother found me here.He quickly form’d his brave design,To set me captive free;And on the moor his horses wait,Tied to a neighbouring tree.Then haste, my love, escape away,And for thyself provide ;And sometimes fondly think on herWho should have been thy bride.Thus pouring comfort on my soul,Even with her latest breath.She gave one parting fond embrace,And clos’d her eyes in death.In wild amaze, in speechless woe ;Devoid of sense 1 lay :—Then sudden, all in frantic mood,1 meant myself to slay.And rising up in furious baste,1 seiz’d the bloody brand ;A sturdy arm here interpos’d,And wrench’d it from my hand.A crowd that from the castle came,Had miss’d their lovely ward :And seizing me, to prison bare,And deep in dungeon barr’d.It chanc’d that on that very mornTheir chief was prisoner ta’en ;Lord Percy had us soon exchang’d.And strove to soothe my pain.And soon those honour’d dear remainsTo England were convey’d ;And there within their silent tombs.With holy rites were laid.21For me, I loath’d my wretched lifeAnd long to end it thought;Till time, and hooks, and holy menHad better counsels taught.They rais’d my heart to that pure souu<Whence heavenly comfoit flows :They taught me to despise the world.And calmly hear its woes.No more the slave of human pride,Vain hope, and fordid care;I meekly vowed to spend my lifeIn penitence and praYer.The hold Sir Bertram now no more,Impetuous, haughty, wild;But poor and humble Benedict,Now lowly, patient, mild.My lands I gave to feed the poor,And sacred altars raise ;And here a lonely Anchorite,I came to end my days.This sweet sequester’d vale I chose,These rocks and hanging grove,For oft beside that murru’ring streamiMy love was wont to rove.My noble friend approv’d my choice }This blest retreat he gave;And here I carv’d her beauteous forts,And scoop’d this holy cave.Full fifty winters, all forlornMy life I’ve linger’d here ;And daily o’er this sculptur’d saint1 drop the pensive tear.And thou, dear brother of my heart.So faithful and so true,The sad remembrance of thy fateStill makes my bosom rue !Yet not unpitied pass’d my life, ^Forsaken or forgot,The Percy and his noble sonsWould grace my lowly cot.Oft the great Earl from toils of state.And cumbrous pomp of power,-Would gladly seek mv littleTo suend22But length of life is length of wo*,I liv’d to mourn his fall :1 liv’d to mourn his godlike Song.And friends and followers all.But tjiou the honours of thy race,ly»v’d youth, shall now restore,And raise again the Percy nameMore glorious than b.efore.He ceas’d, and on the lovely aairHis chosen blessings laid :While they with thanks and pitying tears.His mournful tale repaid.And now what present course to takeThey ask the good old sire ;And, guided by his sage advice,To Scotland they retire.Meantime their suit such favour found,At Baby’s stately hall,Earl Neville and his princely spouseNow gladly pardon all.She suppliant at her nephew’s throne,The royal grace implor’d :To all the honours of the raceThe Percy was restor’d.The youthful Earl still more and moreAdmir’d the beauteous dame;Nine noble sons to him she bore.All worthy of their name.23NOTE S.(1) Robert Stuart, Duke of Albany.a Ralph Neville, first Earl of Westmoreland, who chiefly re¬al his two castles of Brancepeth and Raby, both in thebishopric of Durham.K‘.i> Joan, Countess of Westmoreland, mother of the young lady,was daughter of John of Gaunt, and half sister of King Henry IV.(4) Adjoining to the cliff which contains the Chapel of the Her¬mitage, are the remains of a small building, in which the hermitdwelt. This consisted of one lower apartment, with a little bed¬chamber over it, and is now in ruins; whereas the Chapel, cut inthe solid rock, is still entire and perfect.(5) In the little island of Coquet, near Warkworth, are still seenthe ruins of a Cell, which belonged to the Benedictine monks ofTynemouth Abbey.(6) This is a Bull’s Head, the crest of the Widdrington familyAll the figures, &c. here described are still visible, only somewhateft’aced with length of time.(7) Widdringtpn Castle, about five miles south of Warkworth.(8) In Lower Normandy are three places of the name of Percy;whence the family took the surname De Percy.(9) William de Percy, (fifth in descent from Galfred or Gaffreyde Percy, son of Mainfred) assisted in the conquest of England,ana had given him the large possessions in Yorkshire of EmmadePorte, (so the Norman writers name her) whose father, a greatSaxon Lord, had been slain fighting along with Harold. Thisyoung lady, William, from a principle of honour and generosity,married ;—for having had all her lands bestowed on him by theConqueror, “ he,” to use the words of the old Whitby Chronicle,“ wedded hyr that was very heire to them, in discharging of hisconscience.” He died at Mountjoy, near Jerusalem, in the firstCrusade.(10) Agnes de Percy sole heiress of her house, married Josee-line de Louvaine, youngest son of Godfrey Barbatus, duke ofBrabant, and brother of Queen Adeliza, second wife of King Hen¬ry 1 , he took the name of Percy, and was ancestor of the Earls ofNorthumberland.

Thisis hollowed with great elegance, in a cliff near the river; as arealso two adjoining apartments, which probably served for the Sa¬cristy and Vestry, or were appropriated to other sacred uses; forthe former of these, which runs parallel with the Chapel, appearsto have had an altar in it, for occasionally celebrating the mass.Fach of the apartments is extremely small; for the principalChapel, in length, exceeds not 18 feet—and the breadth andheight not more than 7 feet and a half. It is, however, verybeautifnllv designed, and executed in the solid rock, and has allthe decorations of a complete Gothic Cathedral in miniature.But what principally distinguishes the Chapel, is a small tombor monument on the south side of tlie altar; on the top of whichlies a female figure, extended in the manner that effigies are usual •ly exhibited praying on ancient tombs. The figure, which is verydelicately designer!, some have supposed to be the image of theVirgin Mary; hut it has not the least resemblance to the mannerin which she is represented in the Romish Churches, where she i»usually erect, as the object of adoration, and never in a prostraterecumbent posture. Indeed, the real image of the blessed Virginprobably stood in a small niche, still visible, behind the altar ;whereas the figure of a Bull’s Head, which is rudely carved at theLady’s feet, the usual place for the Crest in old monuments, plain¬ly proves her to have been a very different personage.—About thetomb are several other figures cut in the natural rock, like thosebefore mentioned. 'Vhat slight traditions are scattered throughthe country, concerning the origin and foundation of the Hermit¬age tomb, &c. are delivered to the reader in the following rhymes.It. is universally agreed, that the founder was one of the Bertramfamily which had once considerable possessions in Northumber¬land, and were anciently Lords of Bothal Castle, which is 10 milesfrom Warkworth. He has been thought to be the same Bertramthat endowed Brinkhurn Priory, and built Brinkshaugh Chapel,which both stand in the same winding valley, higher up the river;but Brinkburn Priory was foundtd in the reign of King Henry 1.The style of the architecture of the Chapel of the Hermitage p e-vailed at a later period, about the reign of King Edward III.FINIS.

C O U N T, of the cruel Suffer¬ings of the Fallengets on boardthe BRIG NANCY bound forNEW-YORK being, a Relationof the barbarous and inhumanTreatment, which thofeEMI-! GRANTS, met with from theCaptain and Ships Crew, bywhich near one hundred PaOcn-gers died before their Arrival atthat Place in December lad.THAT the Blig belonged to Sunderland ia York-Ihire ; that the owners, or freighters concern¬ed the voyage, were W m P--rk -r, ofif London, merchant and his brother, J. P-rk-r, ofBi-Icout ifland, in Scotland; and the undertaker of agentfor fitting out the veffel, fhipping and accommodatingthe pafTengers, &c. was R 1 Gr - y, of Souther¬land : that by agreement the veftcl was to have been(ready to fet out early in the Summer, and tho’ it wasexpefted, that the owners, and contrafter would oftheir own accord provide every necefTary of provifi-| on, and accomodation for the paffengeis, and thatithe captaiu would fee fuch provifion made, yet Mr.M‘Coy (one of the principal palTengers, who em¬barked, with his Wife and children) prudently took.care, that a written contraft, mentioning the principal& .articles of provifion, and allowance, for the people onI ihe palPage, &c. fhould be figned by the undertaker,and captain, before embarkation ; and to the premedi¬tated breach of conti aft, in the time of fet ting out(which was not till the 17th of September, when theL 2 3ground was covered with fnow) in want of provisions,and neceffaries, and in unmanly and cruel nfage on thevoyage, was apparently, owing the diftrefsthat fuccecd-ed, the lofs of more titan a third of the lives on board,and manifeft danger of all the reft.After embarking, the ftvft inconveniency that pre-fented itfelf, was the want of room ; the vefld \bur-den about 150 tons) being too fmall for the accommo¬dation of 300 paftengers; nor was fhe properly fittedwith conveniencies, for ftowage, deanlinefs, cooking,&c. The pafteogers foon experienced a numerous trainof wants, and incouveniencies, arifing from mere ne¬gligence, or defign, in the undertakers. There werendeed in the hold, conveniencies made for the fupportand divifton of the beds ; but between decks, the wholefpace was left entirely open, fo that the people couldonly lodge on the floor of the deck, and when the Shiprolled, were thrown all together, and tumbled from fideto fide. Soon after they put to fea, the weather prov¬ing ftormyv and the people, as nftal, being all fea-fick,had little inclination to eat; but the wind being contra¬ry, they put into the harbour of Stromnefs, in the Ork¬neys, where finding the veflel had no pot or kettle, fuf-ficient for the number of pafTongers, they propofed tobtiy one there, at their own expence; but the captainwould not agree to it, telling them, that if they hadinch a one on board, he had no conveniency in the vef-fel, fornfingit. Thus unprovided, they fet out a-gain, when the wind continued contrary, and exceed¬ingly ftormy for about 6 weeks together, during whichtime they were beating off the Lewes and Shetland ifles,and the coaft of Ireland, generally in light of land, andcould, at any time, have pot into thofe places, as tneyearneftly entreated the captain to do, but he re.ufed,faying he was unacquainted with the coaft. They af-fured him, if he would put in, they would pay all theexpence of a pilot; but he abfolutciy refufed, and Hillkept off at fea. During this time, the people were ina moft uncomfortable, melancholy, and diltreffed fitua-tibn, through ficknefs, want of conveniencies, and ne- ^C 3 1ceflaries, and the unwholefomnefs and fiench of theplace, together with the brutal and cruel behaviour ofthe captain, mate, and moft of the crew. After the feaficknefs began to abate, and the people to want nourjfh-ment, as there was no appearance of cooking, cr anyprovifion for them, the captain was fpoke to about it,and defired to order their provifion to be dreffed. Hefaid be had no cook; and when they exprdTed theirfurprife, that he fhould undertake to bring out fuch anumber of pafTengers, without having a cook on board;he faid he had been told a cook was unnecefTary, forthat they could cook for themfelves. However, he or¬dered them pretty near their proper allowance, and asthey had been fome weeks without meat, two poundone half each full paflenger which was due to them, wasdelivered, and this was all the meat they had duringthe whole paflfage. They made the befl: fhift theycould, to cook this meat; but. it was fb ill done, andfo fait, that it afforded but little fatisfaftiou and to in-creafed their third, that they drank an unufual quanti¬ty of water; ‘on which the captain took eccafion to ad-vife with fame of the principal palfengers, whether (asthe wind continued dill unfavourable, and threateneda long paflage) it would cot be expedient, to withholdfrom the padengers (till they fhould have made fomeprogrefs on their voyage) meat, which while they con¬tinued unwell, did them little fervice, and by increafingtheir third, might occafion the water as well as themeat, to fall {hurt. The perfbns confulted, readily con¬curred with the captain in opinion, that for the prefenr,meat might be withheld. The captain and feamen ap¬propriated the cabin to themfelves, where they livedplentifully on good provifions, while the padengerswereconfined to black raw mudy meal, and dinking water.—The door of the bulk bead between the companion,and the deck where the padengers were, was dronglyfadened with nails, fo that the padengers had no air butwhat came in at the hatches, which occafiohed them tobe left open, in all weathers ; and as no contrivancewas made to fccurc them from the fea:, that beat intoL 4 ]the reffel, whofe torrents would frequently pour down,whereby the puiTengers, fick, fcarce able to crawl, andfotne of them dying, were foraethues almofl drowned,while their cries and diilrefs, were made matter oflaughter and derifion, to the inhuman captain, and hiscrew, who while the helm was lafhed, and the velTel ly¬ing to, for a week or tea days fucceffively, very uncon¬cerned took their reft, without affording the leaft affift-ance to the diftrefted fulferers on board, who in theftarknefs of the night, could not obtain a fpark of lightto fee how to ihclter themfelves, or procure dry clothes.When the wind at laft came fair, and they were pro¬ceeding on the voyage, the people who had been fo longconfined to the ftarvirg mifcrablediet of raw meal andwater, but now extremely folicitous for meat, for whichthey were almoft in a longing condition, and as therewas a confiderable quantity of their ftipulated allow¬ance due to them ; they defired it might then be deliv¬er’d. The captain faid he had but a bare fufficiijncy forhimielf and ieamsn, and could fpare none,—the paffen-gers were amazed, and reminded him of the agreementfigned with his own hand,—but told him if he wasreally fcant, they would be content with a fmall part oftheir due, if it v'as only a pound or lefs to each. Butno entreaties could prevail on him to let them have aroorfel. When he was reminded of his contratt, andthat on his arrival fie would be called to account for hisconduff, he difeovered fomc uneafy apprehenfions, andfwore he ha4. a great mind to put into the firft laud hecould make, and with the feamen quit the vdfel altoge¬ther, leaving the paftengers to fliift for themfelves.His behaviour gave them reafon to think he had real¬ly fuch a defign in contemplation, and that on their ap¬proach to any land, he would have hoifted out the long¬boat and left them, pretending they were mutinous iand his conduft feemed calculated to make them fo ;for he, his mate, and moft of the crew, ufed the wo¬men and children, and indeed ail the paflengers, witha utmoft brutality, contempt and infult.Whtn the bufbaud of a poor fick woman begged foraL 5 J ,a little meat for his wife, who alnooft longed for it, hewas not only refufed but infulted ; after they had regaled theoifelves with meat, they would offer the barebones to tire people, and to this man in particular, afk-ing, If they -would buy fame fat beef l and would orderthe bones and leavings of their meals to be thrown down,into the hold, “for the Scotch negroes ^ and whilethefe injured people were fufferiag variety of diftrefles,wounded in their moft tender concedHons, as well :.s byperfbnal wrongs and infults, it was hard to reftrain them-itlves from making the unmanly captain and his crewfeel the immediate effefts of their refentment : but itwas prudently reprefented to them, that bad as the cap¬tain and his crew were, in their fafety that of all tnepafTengers was involved ; that the leaft violence offeredto them, would beconftrued into a mutiny, and wouldgive him an excufe for his conduct, and an opportuni¬ty to throw all the blame up6n them.Thefe reafons had due weight, and prevented theleaft offer of violence to the captain or his men, wholebrutality and cruelty feemed to incrcafe, and was conti¬nued during the whole voyage, as if intended to pro¬voke the people to mutiny, that he might thereby befurnifhed with an excufe for his conduct. Mean whilethe licknefs, mortality and diftrefs of the people wascontinued and augmented by the ill ufage that occsfion-ed it.On fome damage being done by the fea to the caboufeor ftand where the largeft pot was fixed, it was faid tobe rendered ufelefs, and w'as flowed away in the hold,the other pot, which was fmall, and which the paf-fengers were allowed to ufe only 4 or 5 hours in the day,afforded very few of them an opportunity of boilingtheir meal and water, or even warming their water.When they crawled up to the deck, to .get a little air,or near the fire to warm theififelves, or their food, theywere abufed with the groffeft language, and pushed,kicked, cuffed, or beaten away : one poor woman, whowith a little fkillet, was warming fome of her meal andvatcr at the fire, by the tolling of the {hip, or fome o- r . i- ^ther accident, happening to fpil fome of it on deck, wasleized by the (houlders, and dragged over it to wipe itup with her clothes, and the reft of her mefs thrown o*ver board. Another woman was ftrnck on the breaftby one of the men, and fo much hurt, that her life isfail in danger. A poor fick child, who could not drinkthe water afforded them, which Trunk intolerably, ear-neftly begged tor a little good warm water, and not be¬ing not able to obtain it, continued to call for it till hedied. Another poor child having got to the fire, themate took him up, and dallied him againfl the deck,whereby he was much hurt, and confined to his bedtill he died, about a fortnight after. A young manwho ufed fome times to affilf the feamen in working theveffel, being wanted for that purpofe when he was be¬low, eating his unfavoury meal, the captain ran to himfeized the hair of his head, and by it dragged him upfour flops to the deck, throwing to the wind a handfulof the hair which was left in his hand.It would be tedious to recount all the injuries thofepoor people fuffered from this barbarous captain, hismate, lecond mate, and moft of his men. Some ofthem indeed, for a high price fold fome of their provi-fion to fuch paff.ngers as were able to pnrehafe it, andone man who feemed to compaflionate their cafe, andwhen he had an opportunity gave fome of them reliefand affiflance, for this was feverely ufed and beaten bythe captain and the reft of his ctew, who would not e-ven afiift them in djawing up and committing theirdead to a watery grave without a fee of 6 pence for each.Of above 50 children at the breaft, and not morethan 4 years of age, all died but one, and many of themothers; 7 women who were delivered on board, alldied but one, with all the children. When fome ofthem, in the captain’s hearing, lamented the lofs of fomany lives, he laid with great earneftnefs, he -wifoed toCod they were all dead, and that then he could go toCarolina without calling at New ^ork. Many of the peo¬ple behevei that he not only wifned their death, butWould contribute towards it all in hi? power, and evenI hat he fet out with fuch a difpofnioii from t?ie sir ft—ft or the veflel was entirely unprovided with many aecef-aries for the prefervation of the paflengers, and the ne-eflaries he had, he withheld from them. He had noilantern, nor fpy glafs, nor candles, even for himfdf,i xcept a fmall parcel infufficient for the p flige, and ife had not been fupplied by one of the paflengers, whoisppened to bring a box with him, there would have'een none to direct the failing of the veflel.Notwkhlhnding the agreement of half a pound of!:>eef per week for each pafTenger, it appeared there wereut 6 barrels fhipped in all. There were indeed onxoard/i large hhds. of good meal, bat thefe it fectncde intended to convert to his own ufe, for he gave theaflengers none of it; he had a’.lb for himfelf and crew,ood water in plenty, but gave tire pallengcrs only cor-j upted {linking water, that was of itftlf fuffki mt, in! uman probability, to have deftroyed their lives, withIjoarfe, black mufty meal, hardly fit for fwine to eat,Ind this to be eaten raw ! In fiaort, it feeras wonderfuloat any of them efcaped with life, and contrary to his(idination that they did fo; for he not only declared ity his adlions, but more tiian once plainly by his words.On the veflH’s arrival at New-York, the diftrefs ofhe paflengers, and captain’s behaviour to them, was un-' fccountably, for about ten days, almoft entirely un-Simown in the city. And when at laft it came by degreesi part to be known, and the captain was queftionedn fame parts of his conduft, and made toreftore to the'irviviug Cofferers, the deficiency in their allowance ofpef and meal; yet by feme means or other, that per¬haps ought to be enquhed into, fome material wituef-Hs were, by defisa or accident, out of the way, and didjot appear againft him ; lb that he was permitted to go-a large, till Friday evening laft, when he in a private1 d clandeftine manner, got on board and went off withs veflsl in the night. It is faid he is gone to Northjltrolina; and as it is hoped iliefe is hardly fuch anotherjaftcr of a valfi 1, and crew, in his Majeity’s dominions;      - ,hijV[ « 3 .this account is publifhed, that he may be known in allparts oi. them..The mind; of the inhabitants were never known to bemore tenderly affefled than by the cafe of the unfortu¬nate people tettly landed heie from the brigantine Nan¬cy, capt. S h, from the Highlands of Scotland."When they embarked, their numbers were about 280;their allowance was to have been one pound of mealeach day, and half a pound of beef each week: but, 1Itrange to relate, the whole floreof beef amounted on¬ly to fix barrels for the voyage, in which fixtetn weekswere expended. During the whole paflagp, their prin¬cipal futteuance was pea meal, mixed with bear meal; ifor they were denied their favourite aliment (oatmeal)and there was a flock of it on board. Their water was :put into foul wine calks, which turned it four, and oc-?cafioned a violent dyfentery: about eighty of their num¬ber died of this difeafe: and, incredible to fay it, therewas fixpence flerling exafted from the living for the li¬berty of lifting each lifelefs corpfe over the fide, and de-jpoll ting it in a watery grave. In Ihort, there appearcircumfiances uncommonly favage and brutal in thetreat-;ment of thefe wretched paflfengers. The contra&orsin Scotland are very highly cenfured ; for their mifer-jiable manner of victualling the vefiel could hardly be ac-Jcompanied with orders to treat the poor folks with cruel-;,ty and ini'upportable iufoiences which they loudly com-jplain of.When their forlorn condition was communicated to|the rev. Dr. Auchmuty, rector of Trinity, and to theiother clergy of the church of England, they, laft Sun-^day, very pathetically recommended it to their three fe-jveral congreeations, from whofe cordial beneficence rejfulled contributions mounting to upwards of 120 1. and.a very refpe&able fum had the preceediog Sunday beeascollected fort he fame benevolent purpofe, from the con-[gregation of the Proteflant di/Ienters. The money hasbeen entrufled to the hands of geqtlemen who are ap¬plying it in the moft effettuai way to recruit and relievethefe real objefts of charity and preteftioa.

Weft Bow, where they, provoked by what he didnot know,fac’d about and fir’d towards the Graf*-I Market; That his firft Notice thereof was by hear.J ing ir, which made him turn about in order toftopi: it j That at this Place he neither fired, nor gave| Orders to fire : That he marched as many of hisi Men as he could gather together back to the City-guard Room, where he prevented the Mens clean¬ing their Pieces, that the Guilty who fired might. I be diftingiiilhed from the Innocent who did not! fire j That his own Piece had not at that Time1 been at all fired ; That, confcious of his own In*; hocence, he prefented himfelf before the Magi-’ firates, whereas nothing was more eafy to himj than to have made his Efcape, and that in theirtrefence the Firelock that was in his own Handwas prefented, and appeared not to have been ati all fired ; and that therefore the Libel, as libelled,could not lie true.That the delivering Powder and Ball to thepity Guard, and the Direction to the Pannel, tofup-fupport the Execution of . the Sentence againll'Witfon, and in Cafe of a violent Refcue, to repelForce by Force, amounted to a fTar Order from theF'agiltrates to fire when it became neceflary ; andkthat the violent Afiault by the lob with Stones,in order, as the P*auel believed, to carry off theOffender, in Hopes of recovering him to Life,made it necefTary to repel Force by Force whichought to be fullained as a total Defence againftthe indfffment, at leaf! as Circumftances fir to mi¬tigate the Punilhaient, and reftrain it from thepjuu ordinma, fince the Pannel being verfam in U-cito) and engaged in the Diffharge of a lawfulPiece of Duty, iffany Excefs was committed byhim, it ought not to be attended with capital Pit- ;nifhraent, but ought to be correfted extra ordintru,according to the Degree of the Excefs &c.To th^feit was anfwered, Thattho’it were truethat the Magistrates upon juft Apprehenfivin of aviolent Relcue of the Criminal, had ordered Pow¬der and Ball to be diftribured^to the Guard, haddire&ed the Pannel at all Hazards to fupport theExecution, and prevent a violent Refcue * and hadeven told him. in cafe ofNeceifity, he was to re*pel Force by Force, it will not in the leaft followthat thefe Orders could in any degree juftify him,exccept in cafe of Neceffity, and an Attem ■ madeto wards a violent Refcue * That no Order from a-ny civil Magiftrate whatever,could juftify fo hor¬rid a Barbarity, and that tho‘ the Magiftrates hadordered him on the Spot to fire upon innocent Peo¬ple, it could not in the lea ft acquit him, fince hewas not at all bound to obey fuch illegal Orders.That the Pannel doss not pretend to have had anyOrders to fire, except in the Cafe of a violent Attemptempt to Refcue; and had fhat happened, thereading the Proclamation would have made it juf-ifiable; that it is not even denied by the Pannel,hat the Execution was over before the Firing ; thatIhe Truft repofed in him, and the Duty expe&edfrom him was ceafed ; he was no longer an OfUcermployed to that End for which the Fire Armsrere loaded •, and his A&ions came then to be ef-imated of, by the fame Rules that would havelade them lawful or unlawful upon every ordina*f Occafion; that tho’ the flinging of Dirt andtones a: the Executioner, might perhaps juflify aholerkk Perfon for drubbing any of the Actorst-their ’Vantonjjfifs, yet it could not juftify thejughrering of them, faTTefs could the Impertinencea few Boys, or ocher idle People, excufe theing (harp Sfio upon an innocent Multitude ;hat it is far from being the Intereft of the. -own or the Publick, that an innocent Man fhouldft'er • but it is greatly the Interefl: of both, thatifarr'and'ftriQ Enquiry be made where the Guile, 3, when a MalTacre fo cruel and dangerous bap-|ns that the Guilty may be made an Example1 jo reft rain others to commit the like in time?piing, &c. That therefore the Pannel muft HandI fall, upon his being or not being Guilty of theIcls charged upon him in the Indictment.The LORDS Interlocutor.Ends, That the Panne! having, at any of theTimes and Places libelled, fired a Gun amongPeople alTembledat the Execution libelled, orhaving giv n Orders to the Soldiers under hismmand to Are, and thereupon they the the Sol*rs, or any of them, having accordingly fired,andarid upon the firing either by himfelf or them', thePerfons mentioned in the -Indiftment, or any ofthem, w|re killed or wounded, or the Pan*nel’s being guilty Art and Part of any of the foiev,(aid Crimes, all fepjraihn relevant to infer thePains of Law: But allows the Pannel to adducewhat Evidence he can, with refpeit to his Behavi¬our, at the Time the forefaid Crimes are libelled tohave been comrriitted, for taking off the Circum"ffances which fhall be brought, for inferring hisbeing guilty of or Art and Part of the Criiriejlibelled, and remits, &c.The VeraiB of the J U R f.\17E all in one Voice find it proven.

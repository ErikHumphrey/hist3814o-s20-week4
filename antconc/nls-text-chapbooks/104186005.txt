It was then stronglyremarked i* her, that she made observations onpeople’s features and manners; would sit up wholenights when the atmosphere was clear, and seemedas intent on considering the stars, as the greatest Ifastrologers would be with their glasses; this gaveher a great knowledge of the weather, the altera¬tion of the air, and the effect it had ; and from hersometimes casually acquainting the neighbouringfarmers of any change which generally took place,her fame began to spread when young, and she wasconsulted by them on almost every occasion ; nota farmer would go to plough, uot a sower wouldput the seed in the ground, without first asking theyoung gipsey (for so they then styled her) heropinion, and following according to her dictates.Her fame now began to spread, and Bridget’sprescience became more universal; other personsbesides farmers and her neighbeurs camo to con¬sult her, aad the truth of her perdictions made herveracity gain ground, and she became the topic ofconversation of the politest circles, many of whomcame in their equipages to consult her; and shenever asked for any particular sum, so the un¬bounded generority of those who applied to her•melee, pat her in poseeeeion of more money thanwm gaffiount to maintain her.JUi eh* grew in years, like the generality *f eUI, . 5folks, she became fond of dumb animals, which wereher chief companions ; and of those she always hadnumbers ; people, indeed, have said hundreds, andothers have declared she could call as many on theearth as she pleased ; but this is fabulous, for I ne¬ver saw more than ten at a time. Dogs and catswere the principal companions of her retirement,which, being of the smallest breed, would, as she sat,creep from different parts of her garments, and nota little surprise those that came to see her, and,indeed, frightened many ; though, to do her justice,she desired her visitors not to bo terrified at her do¬mestics, as she termed them, for they were not likemany that attended on the gentry, saucy, imperious,and unfaithful, but were always attendant on thowill of her whose hand fed them, nor would injurewithout provocation, a lesson, she used to say, shewished was learned by all mankind.Of a pipe of tobacco our Bridget was exceeding¬ly fond, and, indeed, was continually whiffing ; andas she indeed, humourously used to observe, she had“ sent more puffs into the world, than all the quacksin the kingdom from a long contracted habit,likewise, when she was smoking, of ever beingseated so that her knees almost touched her visage,her limbs became so contracted, that when sho be¬came in years, she was almost double, which, to¬gether with her enormous length of nose and chin,her pip<4 and the number of animals about her,made her cut a most hideous figure, and appearrather uncommonly terrifying to those who werenet apprised of it.6Though this famous old ■woman had never beentaught to write, jet by long practice she had form¬ed to herself a kind of hieroglyphica! characters, in •which she deciphered her observations, knowtedgo, i,and ren^arks ; these i found concealed Mitiiiu the ythatch of her cave : but as they were so iminheUigi- ■bio, ( thought it would l>o impossible to make ,«bead or tale of such a heap of monsters, and other ifigures as were attempted to be drawn ; but as 1 am r.rather of a studious turn, [ thought as I had made j(jit my business formerly to transcribe the Egyptian (hieroglyphics, which, when they were as unintelhgi-hi a to me as these, I might by perseverance get atthe depth of tins valuable manuscript, or at least 11it would serve to deposit in the British Museum, astho mn&ius of a woman who was eo famous, andwiiose name was so well known among mankind.i was therefore immediately determined on re¬newing my labours with redoubled ardour and un-wearioii application ; and at length, as perseveranceaud resolution will conquer difticulties, I found it,and the whole mystery was opened unto me. Thinkof my joy; not die miser who has found a treasureho supposed lost; not a maiden who finds her lover jreturned after a long voyage, whom she thoughtperished iu die waves, but finds restored te heranus with love and fidelity; not—but a truce withmetaphors—it is enough to tell tiie reader that Iwas at length enabled to read this valuable work,and found by experience, that die maxims and re-HMurks, her observations and judgement, have been7extensive, are true, strongly characteristic, an<lwould do honour to the most experienced astrolo¬gers.Nature sometimes in her roughest coat dropsher brightest jewel, which for a long time lies hidtill developed by some experienced adept. So wemay observe of our authoress, that though cloth¬ed in the meanest garb, nature showed herself inher abilities, and left it for me to hand down toposterity what otherwise would be last in obli¬vion.Thinking, therefore, so precious a jewel shouldnot remain long hid, but shed its lustre to all eyes,I immediately set about putting it into English ;which at length I have accomplished, and usher it,into the world, requesting the gentle reader to excuse my literal errors ; and if he reaps any benefitfrom this production, 1 shall not think my labourtil bestowed, though all the merit is due to thedeceased authoress.THE TRUEFORTUNE TELLER.*An Explanation of the Circles of the Sphere, andsome other Terms of Astrology, for the easier Un¬derstanding of this Book, and further informationof the Reader.The Equinoctial circle, Equator, or Equinox, isa great circle or line, equally distant from the twopoles of the world, dividing the sphere in themidst.Zodiac is a broad oblique circle, crossing theequinoctial in two opposite places, viz., in the be¬ginning of Aries and that of Libra, so that onehalf declines towards the south ; and in this circleis comprehended the twelve constellations or signs,every sign containing thirty degrees in length, andtM*elve in breadth. Note also, that the first six arenorthern signs, and the last six southern signs.The Ecliptic line, is a line imagined to go alongi n the midst of the Zodiac as a girdle, out of whichthe sun never goes; but the moon and other planetsare sometimes on the one side, and sometimes onthe other side, which is called their latitudes, onlythe fixed stars alter not. their latitudes, whethergreat or small; but the longtitude of a star is thearch, or parts of the ecliptic in degrees, between thebeginning of Aries, and the circle which passeththrough the body of the stars ; where note, that9all the circles of the sphere, or liearenj, whetherthey are large or small, have 360 degrees allowedto each of them.Colours are said to be two great moveable cir-| cles, crossing each other at the poles of the world,one cutting the equinox at the beginning of Aries,! Cancer, and Capricorn, and so dividing the globointo four equal parts.Horizon is a great circle which divideth the up-per hemisphere, that is, the upper part of the world,| from the lower, we always being supposed to bo1 between.Meridian is a great circle passing through the| polo of the world, and the poles of the horizon,| called the Zenith and Nadir, (which are two points,; one directly over our heads, the other directly un-! der our feet) on which the sun is always just at1 noon, and to go directly north and south, the me-| ridian is changed ; but to go to east and west, it is; changed to sixty miles, either way makes one de-I gree, or four minutes of time difference under theequinox, viz. 60 miles eastward, it is noon foura minutes sooner, and sixty miles westward, fourminutes later.Tropics are supposed to be two lessor circles,parallel with the equinoctial, and distant from it oneither side 23 degrees 31 minutes each ; tho eclip¬tic lino touches the tropics of Cancer on the northside of the equinoctial, and it touches tho tropicsof Capricorn on the south side thereof, so that thesun hath his motion between those two circles.The Arctic circle is equally distant from thonorth pole, as the tropics are distant from tho equi¬nox—23 degrees 31 minutes.Tho Antarctic circle is the same distance fromthe south pole.Zones, so called, are five in number, two cold,two temperate, and one hot, winch are divided by10the tropics arw? polar circles from each other , thehot zoi*» is Connte«l between the two tropics thatare extended from one to the other, being about 47degrees 2 minutes broad; the temperate zones areextended from the tropics, on either side, to aboutA 2 degrees 58 minutes, that is northward to thearticle circle, and southward to the antarctic circleand the two cold zones are each within those twrsmall circles, having the poles for their centre.The Poles of the world—two points exactly op¬posite to each other in tho heavens, one in thenorth, the other in the south, the earth being inthe midst, so that it seems to turn about as if itwore borne up by them; therefore by some it istermed the axle-tree of the world, as if there wasa line supposed to be drawn from one pole throughthe centre of tho earth to the other, and the earthturning thereon ; though Holy Writ tells us—“ Tho Lord hangeth the earth upon nothing, itbeing upheld by bis mighty power." The polearctic, or north pole, is elevated above our horizonabout 51 degrees, and the stars within that dis¬tance from it never set with us, but keep theircourse round it daily; so likewise those that arethat distance from the south pole never rise withus, but perform their course in the like order.Azimuths are supposed lines, or circles of dis¬tance from the meridian, drawn from the zenith toany degree, Or two degrees of the horizon, or ac¬cording to the 32 points of the mariner’s compass,so that in travelling or soiling any way, supposinga circle to go from our zenith directly before us tothe horizon, is the azimuth, called tho verticalpoint, as well as the zenith.AJmicantharats, or Almadarnts, or circles of Al¬titude, are imagined lines passing through the me¬ridian parallel with the horizon.Tho Sphere is a round body representing the1]frame of the whole world, as the circle of the heaven ami the earth. This is sometimes catted amartial sphere, for the orbs of the planets are called their spheres, that is, the circles in which theymove.Ascension is the rising of any star, or any partof the ecliptic above the horizon—Descensiou uits going down.Right ascension of a star, is that part of the eijuinox that rUcth or setteth with a star in the rightsphere ; but an oblique sphere, is that part of theequinoctial in degrees, containing between the hrstpoint of Aries, and that part of the equinoctialwhich passeth by the meridian with the centre ofthe star.Oblique ascenison is a part of the equinoctial indegrees containing between the beginning of Ariesand that of the equinox, which rises with any staror part of the ecliptic in an oblique sphere.Essential difference is the difference between theright and oblique ascension, or the number of de¬grees contained between that place and the equi¬nox that riseth with the centre of a star, and thatplace of the equinox that comet) i to the meridianwith the same star.Solstice is in the summer when the sun is in thebeginning of Cancer; and in the winter when thesun enters into Capricorn: because then the daysseem to stand still, and seem neither to increase u:decrease above two minutes in ten or twelve days.Constellation is a certain number of stars suppos¬ed to bo limited within some form or likeness ;• asAries the Rain is said to have thirteen stars,;—Taurus the T’nll, thirty-three ; A returns, Orion,and the Pleiades, mentioned in Job, tx. 9, are saidto be constellatiads.Planets are the seven cratique, or wandering stars.,called Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Venus, Mercury,12Sol, and Luna. These planets have also their se¬veral motions, as—Direct, is a planet moving in its natural course,which is forward.Retrograde, is their moving baekwaixl, contraryto their direct motion.Combust is their being under the sun’s beams, orwithin eight degrees of it.Oriental, is when a planet riseth before the sun,—Occidental, after him.Latitude of the earth is the distance or breadthon either side of the equinox towards the pole, andthey that are under the equinox have no latitude,but the poles of the world are in the horizon. Thisis a right sphere, and every 60 minutes directlynorth and south, are said to make a degree of la¬titude in an oblique sphere ; as London is countedto be in 51 degrees 32 minutes, the pole thereofbeing exalted as much. The like is to be observedm any other place or region.Longitude of the earth is the outside thereof,extending from west to east, crossing the latitude atright angles ; the beginning of which (accordingto some astronomers) is the Canary Isles, so goingeastward quite round the world, unto the same placeagain, which is 360 degrees: and under the equi¬noctial is reputed to be 29,600 miles, reckoning60 miles to a degree ; but the farther off the equi¬noctial the fewer miles in a degree ; for at Londonabout 37 make a degree of longitude, so these de¬grees grow less and less, until they meet at the la¬titude of 90, that is under the poles.Parallels—the lines straight and circular, equallydistant f*om each other, as the equinox, tropics,degrees of latitude, &c.Climate, or clime, is such a space of earth com¬prehended between two parallels, in which spacethere is half an hour difference in the sun dials andlength of the days.I’dAntipodes are those whose feet are directlyagainst ours ; as if a line were drawn from onethrough the centre of the earth to the other.And this shall suffice for an explanation of things,which I have done as briefly as I could for theadvantage of the reader; to whom possibly, thesethings so necessary to bo known, may have hither¬to been concealed.Of the Planetary Pays and Hours, and how to knowwhat Planet a Man is lorn under.The planetary hours are those hours in which eachplanet reigns, and lias the chief dominion; of whichthe ancients gave the following account.Saturn is lord on Saturday—Jupiter lord onThursday—Mars is lord on Tuesday—Sol is lordon Sunday—Mercury on Wednesday—-Venus onFriday—and Luna on Monday.On Saturday, the first hour after midnight, Sa-! turn reigns, the second Jupiter, the third Mars,the fourth Sol, the fifth Venus, the sixth Mercury,and the seventh Luna; and then again Saturn theeight, and so on to Mars the 24th ; and then Solbeginneth the first hour after midnight on Sunday,Venus the 2d, and so on ; Luna the first on Mon¬day, and Saturn the 2d ; Mars the first on Tuesday,Sol the 2d, and so forward, planet by planet, accord¬ing to their order, by whicli every planet reigns thefirst hour of his own day; and so likewise theeighth, fifteenth, and twenty-second; as for instanceSaturn reigns the first hour, the eighth, fifteenth,and twenty-second, on Saturday, Sol the samehours on Sunday, Luna the same on Monday, Marsthe same on Tuesday, Mercury the same on Wed¬nesday, Jupiter tho same on Thursday, and soVenus on Friday, which I have thus set.A TABLE\)j the Planetary Hour of every Day in the Week.SutidavSaturnJupiterMarsSolVenusMerourvJ|5 32 10|t) 13 207 14 21jl 8 15 22|2 9 16 2310 17 24Luna 1 11 18Monday Tuesfiay2 9 16 23 6 13 2010 1711 1812 1913 2014 21247114 218 15 229 16 2310 17 2411 1818 15 2215 12 19Wednesday Thursday3 10 17 247 14 2111 1812 196 13 207 14 218 15 2212 9 16 236 13 208 15 229 163 10 17 244 11 185 12 19Friday4 11 185 12 196 13 207 14 21Saturday(1 8 15 222 9 16 233 10 17 244 11 18123 10 17 247 14 218 15 22|5 12 199 16 23|6 13 20This is so easy it needs little explanation ; its use is to find what planet rules-anv hour of the■lay and every day m the week. As for example—I desire to know what planet iules on Wed!uosday, at 8 o clock at night: under Wednesday Hook for 20, which answers to 8 o'clock at nightior the natural day^ consisting of 24 hours begins at midnight, so that from 12 at noon you begin,o recvOn L>, 14, In, 36, &c. you find that the 20th hour from midnight answers to 8 o'clock atn ight, over against which, on the left hand, you find Sol, which shows that to l>e the horn- of the"an: .~i1L /<1IU 01I <1 kunV'' wllat planet rules at 7 in the morning of that day, von will find itagainst /, winch shews you that \ emis rules that hour; and so of anv hour in the dayHot I shall now eoroe to speak of the significa¬tion of the planetary hour of each planet, and whatit portends to them that are born in them.The hour of Saturn is strong, is good to do altthings that require strength ; such as fighting, hear¬ing burdens, and the like ; but for those things it isvery evil. Tie that is born in the hour of Saturn isslow, dull, and melancholy, of dogged temper anddispositiou, black and swarthy complexion, beingquarrelsome, wrathful, and very malicious.The hour of Jupiter is in all things good, anddenotes peace, lovo, and concord. He that is bornin the hour of Jupiter is of a ruddy and sandy com¬plexion, fair hair, well-proportioned body, and of alovely countenance ; his face rather broad thanlong. He is also courteous, of a very affable car¬riage, moral, and religious.The hour of Mars is evil, and denotes the per¬son born in it to be of a choleric disposition, andof a robust strong body, soon angry, and hard tobe reconciled ; bis face red, and bis eyes sparklingand fiery, much addicted to fighting, and ready toquarrel with every man he meets, which oftenbrings him to an untimely end.The hour of the Sun signifies great strength,very fortunate for kings and princes. He that, isborn in this hour has sharp eyes, brown hair, anda round face, denotes ono that is a great projector,aims at great things, but is often disappointed, andseldom brings his design to passThe hour of Venus is very propitious and for¬tunate, but it is better by night than by day, es¬pecially mid-day, for the sun covers it. He thatis horn in this hour has fair hair, soft eyes, n littleforehead, and a round beard, very complaisant inhis carriage, mighty amorous, a great admirer ofwomen, much addicted to singing and gaming,and spends his money in courting and treating thefair sex.16The hour of Mercury is very good, but chieflyfrom the beginning to the middle. He that is bornm this hour, has stature inclining to tallness, asharp long face, large eyes, a long nose, his fore¬head narrow, a long beard, and thin hair, long armand fingers, of a good disposition, and obligingtemper, much given to reading, and very desir¬ous of knowledge, delighting to be among books,very eloquent in his speech, and yet addicted tolying, and if he is poor, he is commonly light fin¬gered.The hour of the moon is both good and evil,according to the day; for from the fourth to theseventeenth it is good to those that are born underit; but from the seventeenth to tho twentieth it iscounted unfortunate to be born under it; and fromthe twentieth to the twenty-seventh very happy.He that is born in tho hour of the moon (especiallyupon her own day) shall be pale faced, of a thinmeagre visage, with hollow eyes, and of a middlingstature; he appears very courteous and obliging,but is very crafty and deceitful, variable in hishumour, malicious, and his constitution phlegmatic.Thus have I given the reader the judgment ofancients upon the planetary hours, and what theyportend to those that aro born under them, bywhich a person, comparing himself to what is hereset down, may easily know under what planet hewas born.Of the Birth of Children with respect to the Aoe ofthe Moon.To be born the first day of the new moon, isvery fortunate, for to such all things shall succeedwtll; their sleep will be sweet, and their dreamspleasant; thev shall have long life and increase ofriohes.ITA child bom the second day of the new moenshall grow apace ; but it will be much inclined tolust, whether it be male or female. On this dayalso, all thy dreams shall quickly come to pass,whether they be good or bad. It is also good onthis day to open a vein if there be occasion.A child born on the third day of the moon shalldie soon, or at least short-lived ; on this day to be¬gin any work of moment is unfortunate, for it sel¬dom comes to a good conclusion.On the fourth day of the moon the child that is ,born shall prosper in tire werld, and be of goodrepute. On this day it is good to begin any en¬terprise, provided it be done with good advice,and with dependence on Heaven for a blessing.The fifth day of the moon is unfortunate; andthe child that is born therein shall die in its infancy.He that is in danger, and thinks to escape this dayshall certainly be mistaken. If good counsel begiven thee to-day take it, but execute it to-morrow.This day thou may let blood with good success.The sixth day of the moon the child that is bornshall be of long life, but very sickly. To sendchildren to school on this day is very fortunate,and denotes they shall increase in learning.On the seventh day the child that is born maylive many years; on this day it is good to shavethe head, to tame wild beasts, and buy hogs, for hethat doth so shall gain much by them, he that takesphysic this day is like to recover.On the eighth day a child born shall be in dangerof dying young ; but if he survive* his first sicknee*,ho shall live long and arrive at a great estate. Hethat dreams a dream shall quickly have it come topass. Any thing that is lost shall be found.On the ninth day the child that shall be bornshall be very fortunate, enjoying long life, and ar¬riving to great riches. What thou undertakest this18day shall come to a good issue ; he that is pursuedshall escape ; and he that groans wader the burdenof oppression, shall Ins opportunely relieved. Donot let blood on this day, for it is dangerous.On the tenth day a child that is Itorn shall bp agreat traveller, pass through many kingdoms andregions, and at last dio at home in Ids old age. Donothing on this day but what you would have known,for all secrets shall be brought to lightOn the eleventh day of the moon the child thatis born shall be of a good constitution, and be mighti¬ly deVoted to religion, shall be long-lived, and of alovely countenance ; and if it be a female, she shallbe endowed with wisdom and learning. On thisday it is good to marry, for the married couple .shallho happy all their lives, and he blessed with manychildren.The twelfth day of the moon’s age, in.allusion totho twelfth sign of the Zodiac, betokeueth no¬thing but sorrow and woe; and the child born thisday shall lie given to wrathfulness, and subject tomany afflictions.On the thirteenth day the cl did that is bom shallbo of a short life, and by reason of peevish crossnessnever be pleased. To wed a wife on this day isgood, for she shall be both loving ami obedient toher husband.On the fourteenth day the child that is born shallbe an enemy to his country, and seek the destruc¬tion of his prince, which shall bring him to Ids de¬served end. On this day if you give to a sick manphysic, it shall restore him to his former health.On tlie fifteenth day the child that is born shallquickly die. On this day begin to work for it isfortunate. That which was lost yesterday will befound tins day.On the sixteenth day the child born shall be ofill manners, and very unfortunate, insomuch that19though he may live long, yet his life will be a bur¬den to him. It is not good to dream on this dayfor they aro commonly hurtful, and such as cometo pass a long time after.On tire seventeenth day the child that shall boborn will be foolisli to that degree, that it shall bealmost a natural, and thereby become a great afflic¬tion to its parents ; yet to contract matrimony, com¬pound physical preparations, and take physic is verygood ; but by no means let blood.On the eighteenth day the child that shall bebom, if male, will be violent, courageous, and elo¬quent ; and if female, chaste, industrious, and beau-tiful, and shall come to honour in lier old age.Oji the nineteenth day the child then born, if amale, shall be renowned for wisdom and virtue, andthereby arrive to great honour ; but if a female, shewill be of a weak and sickly constitution, yet shewill live to bo married.On the twentieth day the child that shall be borashall be stubborn, quarrelsome, and a great fighter,yet he shall arrive to riches and a great store ofmoney.On the one and twentieth day the child that isbom will bo unhappy, and though he will lie wittyaud ingenious, yet he shall be addicted to stealing.He that is minded to keep his money, ought onthis day to abstain from gaming, else he maychance to lose all. Abstain from bleeding thisday.On the twenty-second day the child born shallbe fortunate and purchase a good estate ; lie shallalso he of a cheerful countenance, comely, and reli¬gious, aud shall be well Loved.(On Die three and twentieth day the child bornshall be of an ungovernable temper, and will givehimself up to wandering abroad in the world, andseeking his fortune in foreign parts, and ia the end20shall be mistaken. This is a good daj to wed awife ; for he that can meet -with a good -wife oughtto marry her while he can hare her.On the Twenty-fourth day the child then bornshall be a prodigy in the world, and make all menadmire his surprising wonderful actions, which shallexceed those of the ordinary sort of men.On the five and twentieth day the child then bomshall be wicked, he shall encounter with many dan¬gers and at last will perish by them. This is anunfortunate day to those who begin any enterprizeof moment thereon.On the six and twentieth day the child that shallbe then bom shall be very beautiful and anwablo ;but yet of an indifferent state in the world, if it bea male ; but if it be a female, a rich man marinesher for her beauty.The twenty-seventh day the child that shall beborn shall be of that sweet and affable temper anddisposition, that it will contract the love of everyone with whom it shall converse : and yet if a maleshall never rise to any great height in the world ;but if a maiden, the sweetness of her dispositionmay advance her, for such a temper is to be esteem¬ed above riches.On the twenty-eighth day the child that is bomshall be the delight of his parents, but yet subjectto much sickness and many distempers, which shalltake it away before it is at perfect age.On the twenty-ninth day the child that shall beborn shall be fortunate and happy, blessed with longlife, and attain to an eminent degree of holiness,wisdom, and virtue. To marry a good wife is agood fortune, and such shall be his that shall marryon this day.On the thirtieth day the child that shall be bornwill be fortunate and happy, and well skilled in artsand sciences2LThese, and divers other like things, happen tomankind according to the different ages and coursesof the moon, which has a great influence upon allhuman bodies.I will, therefore, for the advantage and benefitof my readers, treat a little more distinctly of thepowers and influences of the heavenly bodies, asthey are laid down by ancient and modern astro¬logers, who have written upon that subject morelargely.A brief Prognostication concerning Children bornon any day of the Week.The child born on Sunday shall be of a long lifeand obtain riches.On Monday. Weak and of an effeminate tem¬per, which seldom brings a man to honour.On Tuesday. Worse, though he may with ex¬traordinary violence, conquer the inordinate desiresto which he will be subject, still he will be in dan¬ger of dying by violence, if he has not great pre¬caution.On Wednesday. Shall be given to the study oflearning, and shall profit thereby.On Thursday. He shall arrive at great honourand dignity.On Friday. He shall be of a strong constitution,and perhaps lecherous.On Saturday. This is another bad day, never¬theless the child may come to good, though it bebut seldom ; but most children born on this day areof a heavy, dull, and dogged disposition.Of the evil and perilous Days of evm‘y Month ef theYear.There are certein days in the year which it con¬cerns all persons to know, because they are so p»-■12rilous and dangerous ; for on those days if a manor woman let Wood, they shall die within twenty-one days following: and whosoever falleth sickon any of these days shall certainly die ; and who¬soever beginneth any journey on any of these daysho shall he in danger of death before ho returns.Also ho that marrieth a wife on any of those daysthey shall either he quickly parted, or else live to¬gether with sorrow and discontent. And lastly,whosoever on any of these days beginneth any greatbusiness, it will never prosper or come to the desired perfection.Now, since these days are so unfortunate, it high¬ly concerns every one, both to know and take no¬tice of them ; which that the reader may do, I havesol down in the following order:—In January are eight days, that is to say, the1st, 2d, 4th, 5th, 10th, 15th, 17th, and 19th.In February arc three days, that is, the 8th, 17thand 21st.In March are three days, that is, the 13th, 16th,and 21st.In April are two, the 15th and 21st.In May three, the 15th, 17th, and 20thIn June two, the 4th, and 5th.July two, the 15th, and 20th.In August two, tho 10th, and 25th.In September two, the 6th, and 7th.In October one, the 19th.In November two, tho 5th and 7th.In December three, the 6th, 7th, and lltli.But besides these, there are also the canicular,or dog days, which are those of tho greatest dan¬ger and peril; they begin the 19th day of July,and end the 27th of August, during which timeit is very dangerous to fall sick, take physic, or tolet blood ; but if necessity call for it, it is best to bddene before the middle of tho day.•J3JUDGMENTS DEDUCED FKOM THENAILS.They who have their nails Dread, are of a gentledisposition, bashful, and afraid of speaking beforetheir superiors, or indeed to any without hesitationand a downcast eye.If round the nails there is usually any excoria¬tion, or sprouting of the skin, the person is luxuri¬ous, fearful, and an epicure, loving enjoyment,provided it is to he obtained without danger.When there are certain white marks at the end,it testifies that the person is improvident, soonmining their fortune through negligence.Narrow Nails. The person with such nails isdesirous of attaining knowledge in the sciences ;but is never at peace long with his neighbours.When to narrowness they add some degree oflength, the person is led away by ambitious desires,aiming at things he cannot obtain ; one who, hav¬ing formed notions of grandeur, grasps at theshadow while ho loses the substance.If at both ends there is a redness, or mixture ofseveral colours, the person is choleric, and delightsin fighting.When the end is Mack, the man loves agricul¬ture ; ho places happiness in mediocrity, andfrom thence avoids tho cares attendant on eitherextreme of fortune.Round nails declare a hasty person, yet good-natured, and very forgiving, a lover of knowledge,honest in mind, doing no one any harm, and act¬ing according to his own imagination, being rathertoo proud of his own abilities.Long Nails.

' .U; 1 ‘As in the bosom o’ the streamThe moon-beam dwells at dewy e’en;So trembling pure, was tender loveWithin the breast o’ bonny Jean.And now she works her mither’s wark,And ay she sighs wi’ care and pain ;Yet wist na what her ail might be,Or what wad mat her weel again.8But didna Jcanie’s heart loup light,And didna joy blink in her e’e.As Robie tank! a tale of love.At e’ening on the lily lee ?The sun was sinking in the west,The birds sang sweet in ilka grove :His cheek to tier’s he fondly prest.And whisper’d thus his tale of love :—0 Jeanie fair, I lo’e thee dear ;0 canst thou think to fancy me ?Or wilt thou leave thy mither’s cot,And learn to tent the farms wi’ me ?At barn or byre thou shalt na drudge,Or naething else to trouble thee ;But stray anmng the heather bells.And tent the waving corn wi’ me.Now what ceuld artless Jeanie do ?She had nae will to say him na ;At length she blush’d,a sweet consent,And love was aye between them twa.jrfhfrt rni a^Siow ifc bn• ■;<') id - id sds y r> jjrAjjjint (in uod h-Jw an teiw t*0 7 :e i a ..ctTi b '> i-e ■ ■' n'

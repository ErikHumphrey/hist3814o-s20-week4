He was tryin’ before to mak us beliesthere was some ill in takin’ beans i’ die Sundaiwhen ilka body kens we’ve naething else to doan’ begude to talk about Sutherland, MacJ|(DONALD, and Mackintosh, the Edinburgh ehajtliat were hangit, just as we were doin’ ony thinlike them ; and because we winna gae o’er, 1.now tries to frighten us ; an’ cares nae a farthiifor either him or his beans.—Gang wha will, I’Jdetermined no to flinch till my pouches are baitlweel lined, in spite o’ fate.”“ Then,” said Candid, “ according to what jsay, ye wadna be frighten’d though it was thun’just now. D’ye mind Tam what a fright ye g|yon Sunday forenoon when we war gaen to tturnips ?” “ O ! aye,” said Bragwell, “ bye ken I had a sair fit that time ; but this is a finight, Wull, an’ there’s nae fear o’ thun’erlightning either, ma man ; and I’m as sure tlwe hae naething to be fear’d for just now, as Ithat Doubted’ was speakin’ nonsense whenbegude wi’ his palaver about an e’e seein’ us, whI ran awa’ wi the auld wife’s cloak, whan sheafter us for daddin’ her cabbage at hallo ween,though it was dark. This was the first timefell i wi’ him, an’ I wish we had never kerony thing about him, for he’s aye fear’d for sorthing or ither—J wonder he disna try to fright;,agaia \vi’ this e’e, but he kens we could easily-tintlibira out the night, for its no dark yet.i “Yes,” cried I, “there is an Eye that sees■ you but, before I had time to finish the sentence,Bfc AGWELL had taken to his heels, got across thefield, and without looking behind, leaped over theiwall, and was out of sight in an instant. Careless,at the impulse of the moment, fled also, but havingstumbled into a deep furrow, and observing on his((getting up, that I had not proceeded to lay violenthands on his remaining companions, he returned.iThe other two had been too much petrified at theitime to attempt to fly, and, as Careless cameforward, they stood trembling, and in tears,| before me.As it was my object rather to reclaim than toi terrify, my first effort was to restore confidence by<h soothing expressions. “ Come forward, my youngn; man,” said I to Doubtful, “you have got) | quit of your adversary. What fellow was that, Ii pray, who talked so lustily, and, by his defiance ofi fate, seemed to ‘ mouth the heavensyet fled atj(| my approach; nor looked behind him, thoughI there was neither thunder nor lightning at his heels.| Doubtful seemed lost in thought, and was toou much taken up with his own situation to make anU immediate answer ; gave me to understand that themi name of the runaway was Thomas Buagwell ;I that he was the son of an industrious mechanic, but) one of those easy sort of creatures, who do notJi love to be hard upon their little ones ; who think1^ the greatest punishment that should be inflictedj upon them, is to threaten well, but never to lay on -rf)to so>ti»e them with promises they never mean torealize; and, if all will not do, to make them be¬have peaceably, and stay within doors on a winter’sevening-, to frighten them with bugbears, which, asthe children grow up, they learn to despise ; and.are thus led to conclude, that what their parentstaught them as truth, was a system of deceit andfalsehood altogether.No Wonder, then, that this hopeful plant, nur¬tured in such a bed, after having arrived at six¬teen years of age, vexed the spirit of his grey¬headed parent, by refusing to settle at any em¬ployment. He had not been accustomed to puthis hand to the smallest job as he grew up, andnow that idle habits were formed, the old manfound it was difficult to drive them from him.In his attempts to instil religious principles, andgive Tom some idea of a Divine Being, he was notmore successful ; for although the promise of a newhat, or something fine, would at times make himput on a serious countenance, and even go tochurch, yet, no sooner was his father's back turned,than Tom turned all into ridicule, and would say,“ he used to mak me believe in ghosts and witches,and sic things, when a bairn ; but let him trick menow gin he can.”Doubtful, I found, was more fortunate withregard to his parents,—not that they were in bet¬ter worldly circumstances,—for if there was anydifference in this respect, it was in favour of OldBragwell, but David’s father was a man ofprinciple, and did not spare the rod when lie sawoccasion, nor had he reason in general to bribe his7won with any thing fine to do what was right: huti unfortunately^ this evening, in opposition to his{father's advice and his mother’s entreaties, David'would go out under some pretence, and had not{proceeded far, when he was stopped on his way fey[Candid and Careless, who were loitering at the(head of the Western Lane when he came np to them.Candid, I learned, was a true object of pity,lit had been his misfortune to lose both his parentslat an early age ; and although now entered to ani apprenticeship at thirteen, was still lodged at the(expense of the parish, with an old woman, whothought she did her duty sufficiently if she “ ekxi•and fed him,” as she said, “ without troubling.|berser how he was employed on the Sabbath-day,providin’ he didna stay awa frae the kirk, for gifhe did that, she was sure to hear o’t frae thei minister.”John Caueless, was the son of a poor well-pmeaning widow-woman, but whose over fondnessI for an only child, (who had lost his father, at two('years of age,) was like to prove his ruin ; for theti darling boy had already thrown of all parental re-Mstrainl ; and was fonder of rambling about theI streets, or joining the idle boys on a Sundayevening, at the place of rendezvous.From the history of these three young mew, it isthus easy to account for their being assembled to¬gether when Brag well also made his appearancein an evil hour, and with “ How are ye my brave. lads ! we’re a’ weel met,” and other words ofi similar import, soon ingratiated himself so muchinto their favour, as to find no difficulty in getting8tW better of the scruples of even Douetful himself, and enticed all the three away with him.So dangerous is it “ to stand in the waysinners,” that it is often, (as here it was proved tbe,) but one step to a higher degree of wickednessthe “ walking in the counsel of the ungodly,”What an awful lesson to parents ?—I mean to a!who unconcernedly suffer their children to loitei iidly about the streets at any time, hut especially 01 ja Sunday evening.Do such not consider, the obligation that theand all Christian parents lie under, to bring umtheir little ones in the nurture and admonition of the |.Lord ? And what time more fit for this purposethan the evening of that day, when the pooresilabourer among us enjoys the privilege of repose,and the most humble head of a family has sufficient &leisure to devote his patriarchal powers to the best jinterests of those whom Providence has entrustedto his care.“ W hata pity, my young men,” I resumed,“that you should have been found by Bragwelliu such a situation as this.—A situation of idlenessis the most dangerous in which a young man canhe placed,—you have ho doubt heard the proverb,that, ‘ when the devil finds a man idle, he generally sets him to work’—it was no wonder, then, thatyour depraved associate, who seems to be too muchunder the influence of the evil one, found y«u inthis situation, an easy prey to his deceitful wiles,For it appeal's Tom had not the hardihood to pro¬pose the Bean Expedition all at once; Ns,—it)was OJily “ a walk in u fine evening thiU waa|9he a)luni)<y hait he first held out ; and it wn,^ notill after this had taken effect, and the field ap¬peared in vie\r, that his ultimate intentions becamemore apparent.Having heard this account of the matter, II'ould not help loo'king upon Bragwell as a mostdetestable character, and therefore pointer! out Hiscowardly eonduct in running’ off, and leaving themm the scrape into which he had brought them, (asis usual with s«ch characters,) as one mean to in¬duce his companions to avoid hi* company in future.But what,” addressing myseli to Candid,Jr* did you mean by attempting to frighten 'Bomilwith thunder and lightning ? “ O ! as for that,iiidr,” he replied, “ he kens very weel what Iinmeant hiinsel’, although he pretended lie had alijftair fit. It was ae Sunday, at ween sermons,* thelast harvest, when we were gaun to the turnips ;i Careless was there; hut we had not then fa’enacquaint wi’ Doubtfu’,—when just as we beganto pu\ there was a most terrible clap o’ thun’er,liit which Tam was frighted, an’ wanted to gangiilmme, pretending the turnips were owre sma’.AVe heard some mair dreadfu* loud claps on thecroad, and though Bracwem. limped some, yet heuwas sae frighted that he got aye formaist. Butsae time, he stopped a’ on a sudden, for he thoughta bolt bad broke ow’r our heads. I’m sure i’llne’er forget the glowr he gaed me, when he cried,D’ye hear that Well, man, that’s real awfu!i Gif we were ance hame again, I ’se hae the Biblei!in my hand ! Neist time I saw him, the impres-ision had worn aff; for he said, he saw naething\10worth while readin’ iti the Bible, aed he vv;u j.young and stout, and it was time enough to thinlio’ deeing yet.”“ You acted well,” said I, “ when Tojvi hacbegun to throw out his atheistical notions, to recall to his mind the thunder-storm; but had he!staid, and given me an opportunity, I would havetried to convince this almost convert, or half atheist,:from some of the more common, and less awful j.appearances in nature, that there is, in reality c|God ! and that for the very same reason., whichseems to have had such an effect upon him for¬merly ; namely, because ‘ no human creaturecould do the like !”Here I observed tire countenance of Doubtfulbrighten up. Candid became ail attention ; bullCareless, who had picked up something from jthe ground, was amusing himself by twirling it itIris hand. So true it is, that if you ‘ bray a fyoin a mortar among wheat with a pestle, yet wilnot his foolishness depart from him.’ * What isthat you have got, sirrah ?” said I, in rather atangry tone. “ It’s only a bean-sta’k,” said he.presenting it to me.—“ It’s only a bean-stalk !,,|replied I ; “ but why put only to it, as if it werejta tiling too insignificant to be noticed ? Come Iforward, my lad, and I will endeavour to make}good the position I have just now advanced, con¬cerning the being of a God, from what, as a tiringof no consequence whatever, you call only a beau-stalk.”“ Observe, sir,” said I, while his two com¬panions looked on with surprise, “ of what parts. ?IIwtim htan-sttlk is coinposed. Here is the root fortaking hold of the earth, awi drawing nourishmentI from the soil ; the trunk for conveying the sapliupwards, and supporting tlu; other parts; ther iktle branches, or propis, which support the leaves;the leaves, which serve as organs of respiration, tomodify and prepare the sap as it passes throughthem for its important purposes in the economy ofi vegetation, as the blood is, lor its uses in the ani-m mal structure, by the action of the lungs in its{ circuiatbn tlrrongit them in tire human frame ; and,at die same time, to defend and preserve theflower and fruit in their progress to maturity ; thei1 flowers, which serve to cherish and protect the firstlj| rudiments of the fruit; and, lastly, the fruit itselfi|i which you know partly the use of, but which isI also necessary for the production of the futureI plant ; so that a continual succession of this useful'vegetable may be kept up for man and beast,if You observe how nicely all these parts are adaptedCto their several ends ; but these are only a speci¬men of the wonderful contrivances manifested inI the structure of a bean-stalk. Had I a microscope| to show you the different parts of this common(production of nature when cut across, and wasbotanist enough to explain the several uses of thevarious filmy fibres, tubes, and sap vessels, in itscomposition, you would be lost in admiration ; and,without my having occasion to go further, hadBragwell been here, even he would have beenforced to confess, ‘ that no human creature caulddo the like l’”12Observing tke effect of this discourse upon myyoung hearers, I felt disposed to continue it, and Iasked Doubtful, if he knew how a bean-stalk Iwas produced, (for I still adopted the language ofCareuess,) “ Yes,'1 said he, “a bean is first put 'i’ the ground, then it’s watered hie the rain, and 'tile heat o’ the sun makes it sprout up an’ getripe/’ “ But who made the earth, the rain, and .the sun rejoined I. He was silent, hut hisspeechless eloquence plainly evinced that he under,stood my meaning : so I went on, “ Yes, David, itthe eartli, the rain, and the sun, have all theirseveral uses iu the production of vegetables ; but i!neither the earth, which receives the seed into itsbosom, and covereth it as a garment; the clouds,w hich drop down fatness, and refresh the earth;nor the sun, winch warmeth and fructifieth it byhis beams, made themselves! All these causesmust have had a cause, and the great primary firstcause of all, we call—God !”By these observations on a bean-stalk, yousee, my young friends, that there is no need torwaiting on the loud roaring' thunder, and vividlightning, to convince the unbeliever that there is aQ(K1#—IVo ! the mild and silent, as well as therough and boisterous operations of nature, speakforth the existence of a Deity, and challenge ourpraise, and there is not a spot, however remote,but where the most incontrovertible proofs ofDivinity may be distinctly traced and pointed out;‘ for whither,’ in the beautiful language of thePsalmist, ‘ slrnll we go from his Spirit, or whither* shall we flee from his presence ?”Well pleased, that even Careless himself,had now become an attentive hearer, I went on.“ I have been the more particular, my young' men,i to impress on your minds a sense of the Divinei presence, both from nature and scripture, from ananxious wish to check the first approaches to viceby the most powerful antidote in my power ; beingsensible, that there is no error into which parentscan fell of a more dangerous tendency, than their! taking so little pains to instil into the minds ofi their children this great and fundamental truth,i this ground-work and foundation of all religion,i th;it they are always in the presence of God !“ We are also told in the New Testament,i that 4 he that cometh to GOD must believe thatI He is,’ as well as that ‘ he is the rewarder ofIII them that diligently seek him.’ Indeed, what canI be expected from the conduct of those, whateverI other useful knowledge they may have acquired,who have not been taught, that, when out of sightof their parents, guardians, or friends, an All-seeing Eye still watches their motions, mi Omni¬present Ear still hears their words, an OmniscientGod still knows the secret thoughts and mosthidden intents of their hearts.“ 1 o this, more than to any other cause, (forall others are but secondary to this,) that ‘ God isi not in all their thoughts,’ would I trace that un¬blushing wickedness which now stalks abroad inthe world at noon-day, and has also of late been« productive of such shocking scenes of blood amongmen in the silent hours of darkness. Surely the*Hcruel unmlerers of the MaRB uiul \\ illia.msovfamilies, did not consider that they were in thepresence of God, at the time those most dreadfulmurders were committed ; and it is not possiblethat the unfortunate youths, who by their conduct,disgraced the streets of our metropolis at theGOnmneHoement of the year, had, at the time, ‘ thefear of God before their eyes ?*Poor Doubtpui,, who seemed much affected atwhat I had said, informed me, that just as theyhad arrived at t,he field, the tlwjught struck hiuithat it was the Sabbath-day, ami lie could not for¬bear mentioning' to his companious, tliat the breachof that day, was one of the reasons assigned bythe Edinburgh lads as the cause of their ruin !“ But did nothing strike you farther, David,”said I, “ as to the heinousness of the oBence ofstealing your neighbour’s property, which wasuidawful on any day, even although it had not beenthe Sabbath ?” “ O no,” said he, “it was onlya few beans; I didua mind that, after whatBragwell had said.” Alas! David,” I re¬plied, “ your ideas on this point are still very im¬perfect ; you cannot think of breaking the Sabbath,but you forget to pay proper attention to one ofthe weighty matters of the law—Justice. Mind,my lad, the words of a rule, which justly meritsthe appellation it has obtained, and deserves, in¬deed, to be recorded in letters of gold :—“Therefore;, all things whatsoeverYE WOULD THAT MEN SHOULD DO TO YOU, DOYE EVEN SO TO THEM ; FOR THIS IS THE LAWanj) the Prophets.”15“ How \v<iiilil you have been jileased, if thisfield had been yours, and a parcel of boys (at thetime you were at home reading- your book) badcome out to it, and, not content with filling theirpockets, bad trodden down and injured a considera¬ble part of the corn besides ?“ Who knows but Sutherland, Macdonald, andMackintosh, were among the bean-stealers of lastautumn ! The approaches to vice are easy andalmost imperceptible. A boy begins by stealing amarble from his play-fellow—bis plea is the sameas yours, it was only a marble !—this passes with¬out detection, and he next proceeds to carry offtrifles from bis parents, and divides them with hisschool-fellows :—they, in their turn, do the same,and they have a joint stock of juvenile plunder ;—With his little associates he next sallies out into theopen fields, where they fill their pockets with tur¬nips or beans :—one degree farther, and doors andwails are not proof against their depredations ; forthey find means to rob gardens and orchards ;—a little more advanced, a sense of shame forsakesthem, and they do not scruple, in the confusion ofmobs and fairs, to catch and cany off what theycan lay hold cf—By this time they advance inyears, grow up and get entangled in dissolutecompany, who, for more regular supplies, encour¬age them to advance still farther in the ways ofiniquity,—they now proceed to rob their masters ormistresses, and break into shops and houses,—till,at last, grown hardened in wickedness, they throwofl all restraint, bid defiance to the laws, betakeH>themselves to the highway, and, being fortunate,as tliey call it, in escaping so long, at last finishtheir career on a gibbet!1 again resumed—It gives me great pleasuremy young friends, to observe my words have hadsuch an effect; for your tears show you feel con¬viction, and your promises of amendment give me'reason to hope that I have done something to¬wards reclaiming you from the paths of vice ; andlet me tell you, for your comfort, that the merelybeing sensible of your error, and the forming ofgood resolutions, already prove that you have ad¬vanced two steps on the ladder of repentance.“ Follow these up by an earnest prayer to God,that he will perfect what he has begun, and thereis no fear of you ; for your Saviour not only says,‘ Come unto me all ye that are weary and heavyladen ;* but he also declares, that * Whosoevercometh unto him, he will in no wise cast out.*Engage in prayer, then, with the most heartfeltconviction and unbounded confidence that you willbe heard ; and watch and pray, that ye enter notinto temptation ; avoid carefully the least appear¬ance of evil ; for, as I said before, the approachesto vice are almost imperceptible.“ Idleness, my young man,” addressing myselfto Candid, “ is justly defined ‘ the parent of wantand misery,’ and ill habits are more easily con¬quered to day than to-morrow ; endeavour, there¬fore, to. persist in the good resolutions you haveformed. Fly idleness, and the haunts of idleness,as places of the greatest danger ; and should you17ever again be overtaken in any of these, throughany inadvertency, let the recollection of that sayingof Mackintosh, as a friendly monitor, come toyour aid,—‘ that South Bridge has been my ruin !’“ Disobedience to Parents, David,” turning toDouktful, “ is perhaps a more serious crimethan you imagine. You must know that there isan express command to guard against it, with apromise of long life annexed, to those who attendto it, which, doubtless, implies the threatening ofdeath to its breakers ;—but, that you may be per¬fectly satisfied of the importance of this precept, thewise man says, ‘ The eye that mocketh at hisfather, and despiseth his mother, the ravens of thevalley shall pluck it out, and the young eagles shalleat it.” As your coming here, however, seems tohave been rather accidental, and as you have beenyour own accuser for disobedience to your parents, Ishall not enlarge upon this head farther, than bysaying, that 1 hope in your future conduct, youwill abundantly atone for the errors of the past—>bearing in mind, that in a short time you may hedeprived of one or both of your parents, andhe left, like poor Will Candid, without eitherto advise you —and, remember, that disobedienceto parents, and Sabbath-breaking, were mentionedamong the causes of Sltheuland’s ruin.“ But the twinkling stars now beginning toappear, warn me that it is time to be gone; andthe evening dews make it already unwholesome tostand on the damp ground. Before I, however,depart, I have one' thing to beg of you, which is,18that although I must caution all of you in futureto shun Brag well as a companion, if he continuesin his evil courses, as you would do a serpent, yetfeeling-, as I do, for one in his situation, 1 wouldwish you to go in a body, before you separate, andwhile my words are fresh on your rntynories, amifind him out,—and tell him all that you have heardand seen :—That although he may congratulatehimself for the present, on making his escape bythe use of his legs, and good sea-room, as hetermed it, yet a time may come, and that, perhaps,not far distant, when, immured within the drearywalls of a prison, he may be deprived of both, andbrought to the pitiful condition (like one of theseunhappy young men) of envying the state of amouse creeping across the floor, and be made to say,in the words of poor Sutherland, ‘ Ah ! couldI as easily escaj>e as that little creature will do/“ Tell him,—that there is, in reality, some illin stealing beans on any day, and that the crimeis aggravated by being done on a Sunday ;—that,even although for a time he may go on prosperingin his way, by evading the vigilance of men, yethe must never think to escape the piercing Eye of thataugust Being, who frightened him with the thun¬der of his power :—that, he that formed the eye,cannot but always see:—that He sees him everywhere, at all times, and in all places ; and was noless present when he ran oft with the old woman’scloak in the dark, than when lie hastened to theturnip-field at noon-day ;—that k is not only in thewhirlwind and the storm that the great Creator10rcarvifpsts himself, that,—even ii the smallest in-se<>t that buzzes in his ear,—the most seeminglyinsignificant reptile that crawls at his feet,—or thesmallest blade of grass he treads upon,—he wouldfind, if attentively examined, matter of admiration,and reason to conclude, that ‘ no human creaturecould do the like; ‘that, the hand that made it isDivine !’The Consequen'ces.Although, from the characters of the hoys, in-ll trod need as the heroes of this, the sequel that Iam about to communicate might have been expec¬ted ; yet, I must confess, that at the time I pennedit, I could not possibly have had the remotest idea,that the rapidity of events in the history of thatunhappy individual, whose melancholy fate is aboutl to form the principal part of my story, would have| been such, as to have hurried him so quickly fromione degree of vice to another, till he arrived atthat deplorable condition to which be is now re¬duced ; and which must soon hurry him from anearthly to a heavenly tribunal, with all his sinsand imperfections on his head.Having occasion a few days since to visit thes same town, where my residence was, at the timethe interview above alluded to took place, 1 couldnot help feeling as I passed the well known spot,20ia strong desire to learn something of my youngacquaintances, particularly what impression mydiscourse had made on John' Careless ; andstill more so, to be informed of the fate of his morehardened companion, whom fancy brought to myrecollection, pursuing, with rapid strides, his wayacross the field. For Will Candid and DavidDoubtful, I had the best of hopes from the timeI parted with them, and felt not the smallest anxiety (on their account.No sooner, therefore, had I arrived at my |lodgings, and made arrangements for the night,than I sent a message to Will, and it was notlong ere he made his appearance.“ Well, my young man,” said I, “ do you re¬collect having seen me before ?” “ Yes, sir,” saidhe, “ and I shall never forget yon.” But whathas become of David, and how is he employed ?for I wish to hear all about him.To this he gave roe a very distinct, and, I mustadd, a most satislnctory account of the conduct ofthis young man, in which I could not help re¬marking the wonderful change in his language,and the manner in which he expressed himself,since our last conversation. David, he informedme, now assisted Ids father in the way of his busi¬ness, and had become such a dutiful son, that hisbehaviour was pointed out as a model for youngmen to imitate, all over the neig'hbourhood.“ As for Careless,” said he, “ I have not seenhim for some time ; and from something that hasbefallen him since you was here, worse than the21accident, I am afraid he is not much better for allthat you said to him.But tell me said I, “ what has become ofBragwell ? I hope, William, you did not forgetmy request at parting.” “Ay, Tom Eragwellis in a poor situation now. O, sir, if you had seenhim, when he was marchid off from our prison by *a party of soldiers, it would have made your heai twae to look at him ; for he was math like deaththan life! But it was not your fault, nor ourseither:—far better for him had he ta’en your advice. ’“ Much, very much has befallen him,,, said he,trying to compose himself, while he faultered out—“ He has been guilty of Robbery andMurder! and now lies in Holdagain jail, to betried for his life !After having furnished me with a mournful de¬tail of the iniquitous course he had pursued, sever 1particulars of which the young man had learnedfrom Tom himself, while he lay in prison, I askedhim when his trial was expected to come on, andhow his father bore up under this severe affliction.He informed me, that bis trial was to come onin a fortnight; and that his father, since hisdeparture, was in the roost deplorable conditionimaginable. Sometimes, he observed, the old manwill break out into the most frantic lamentations,taking the whole blame upon himself, that by hiswant of firmness in correcting his son, he wasbrought to the unhappy situation he was in.—He had every reason to believe, that the old manwould not live to be informed of the last momentsof hra $om, as he was apparently sinking*, with fn-ereasiug celerity, under die load of his nccuniiilatetlgriefs, and it was in vain to hope, that any reliefcould be derived from medicine, to a mind diseasedlike Ftis.I could not help being* greatly moved at thisreeftu!, am! recollecting that l should be in liohl-ag'aio Soon after the trial, 1 made urs my mind tovisit Torn jiragwell, in jail, and learn something'more of the eventful history of this unhappy youthfrom' himself.The day of trial cani'e; and, as might havebeen anticipated, the proofs of guilt were so clear,as to leace not a dotibt on* the minds of his judges,and the awful sentence of the law was pronouncedupon him—that on that day fort’nrght, he shouldlie hung up by the neck irritrl he Was dead, andhis body given for dissection.Two days previous to this event I got myselfintroduced to the uiffortunafe voUfh : whom 'I» -t • * . 7 ^found Seated in a distant; corner of his narrow abode,loaded with irons,—his bend reclining upon oneof his hands, while his elbow rested on his knee.At first, h'e seemed totally insensible of, or indif¬ferent to my visit, and I had advanced almost doseup to him, before he appeared to evince the smal¬lest itvdinatron to change his position ; but when1 addressed him in the following soothing strain—u What crime, my p60r young mttn, has'broughtyou info such a pitiful situation ?—he started upfrom his reverie, and, gazing in my face With thewildest confusion, exclaimed—Kobbery and Murdertc be sure ! Ah ! little (lit! I once think that everTom Bragwell would have turned out a murderer!I intimated to him that I had already learnedpart of his history, and wished to be farther in¬formed as to some farther particulars of it fromhimself. To this request he readily assented ;and the details hb communicated, were indeed astriking- illustration of the progress of vice—of tireFatal consequences that result from Idleness andDisobedience to Parents—and that, the way ofi transgressors is hard.On the morning of the execution, the sun arosein clouds, and, as if nature herself wished to addI to the solemnity of the scene, a gloomy darkness,nl and unusual stillness in the atmosphere, markedII the approach of the hour in which Tom Bragwellwas doomed to pay the forfeit of his crimes.I had taken my s'tation in the window of a1 friend’s house that overlooked the place of execu-;l tion, so that I could notice all that passed, without1 being exposed to the inconvenience of a mob ; andi here I had not long remained before the gate» of death opened, and the mournful procession, ini slow and solemn steps, moved forward from thes jail to the scaffold—Alas ! in what a pitiful plightf appeared poor Bragwell.H ow, now, was the crest of the boastful heroi fallen 1—Unable to stand, he was borne forwardbetween two of the officers of justice, and placedI beneath the halter ; but he sunk from their graspat the instant that a loud peal of thunder shook theheavens j and he may be said to have been literal-ly dead with fear at the time tlie executioner per-formed the sad office of adjusting the rope abouthis neck ; which, indeed, he appeared to have con¬siderable difficulty in accomplishing, owing tosomething of a bulky nature, for which J was un¬able to account. Another peal from * heaven’sdread artillery’ seemed to awaken the criminalfrom his fit, just as the cap was about to bedrawn over his face, for he looked fearfully aroundhim ; but the hangman haVing done his duty, andthe attendants having retired, whether from acci¬dent, or that they thought they had had sufficienttrouble with him already, 1 know not, but withoutwaiting for the appointed signal, the drop fell,and, after a few convulsive struggles, the unhappyyouth, cut off for his crimes in the midst of hisdays, went, indeed, to meet his Judge.The rain now pouring down in torrents, dis¬persed the crowd, which gave me an easier passageout, and I found no difficulty to regain my lodgingsbefore the unfortunate lad was cut down, in orderto undergo the‘latter part of his sentence.— I1 toked up to the inanimate corpse as I passed thescaffold, and could not help thinking, that theclothes in which the poor wretch met his untimelyfate, had, in part, assumed somewhat of a bloodyappearance.F I NI 8,

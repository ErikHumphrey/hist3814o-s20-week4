Wallace demandedto know what was the cause of the alarm. Tlipcaptain of tire ship informed him, that the tall ves¬sel which Was bearing dpwn, with (he purpose ofboavding that which he commanded, was the shipof a o lehrafcd rover, equally famed, for his cour¬age, strength of body, and successful piracies. Ttwas commanded by a gentleman named Thomasde Longueville, a Frenchman by birth, but bypractice one of those pirates who called themselvestciends to the sea, and enemies' to all who saifedupon that element. He attacked . and plunderedvessels of all nations, like one of the ancient,Norso*Sea-ktrtgs, as ihey were termed, whose dominionwas upon the mountain wave.' The master add¬ed, that rip vessel'could escape the rover .by niHit,so speedy was the bark he commanded'; and'thatnh'cr?iV, however hardy,'cpuld; hope to resist 1iim,4ttlieri, as was his usual mode of combat, he threwhimself on hoard at the head of his followers.Wallace smiled sternly, while the master of theship, with alarm in his countenance, and tears inhis eyes, described to him the certainty of their be-ing captured by the Red Rover, a name given tode Longueville, because he usually displayed theblood-red flag, which he had now hoisted-“ I will clear the narrow seas of this Rover,*’said Wallace.Then calling together some ten or twelve of hisown followers, Boyd, Kerlie, Seton, and others,to whom the dust of the most desperate battle waslike the breath of life, he commanded them to armthemselves, and lie flat upon the deck, so as to beout of sight. He ordered the mariners below,excepting such as were absolutely necessary tomanage the vessel; and he gave the master in¬structions, upon pain of death, so to steer, as that,while the vessel had an appearance of attemptingto fly, he should in fact permit the Red Rover tocome up with them and do his worst. Wallacehimself then lay down on the deck, that nothingmight be seen which could intimate any purpose ofresistance. In a quarter of an hour De Longue-ville’s vessel ran on board that of the Champion,and the Red Rover casting out grappling irons tomake sure of his prize, jumped on the deck incomplete armour, followed by his men who gavea terrible shout, as if victory had been already se¬cured. But the armed Scots started up at once,and the rover found himself unexpectedly engagedwith men accustomed to consider victory as secure,when they were only opposed as one to two orthree. Wallace himself rushed on the pirate cap¬tain. and a dreadful strife began betwixt them withsuch fury, that the others suspended their own> , 5battle to look on, and seemed by common consentto refer the issue of the strife to the fate of thecombat between the two chiefs. The pirate foughtas well as man could do; but Wallace’s strengthwas beyond that of other mortals. He dashed thesword from the rover’s hand, and placed him insuch peril, that to avoid being cut down, he wasfain to close with the Scottish Champion, inhopes of overpowering him in the grapple. Inthis also he was foiled. They fell on the deck,locked in each other's arms, but the Frenchmanfell undermost; and Wallace, fixing his grasp up¬on his gorget, compressed it so closely notwith¬standing it was made of the finest steel, that theblood gushed from his eyes, nose, and mouth, andhe was only able to ask for quarter by signs. Hismen threw down their weapons and asked formercy, when they saw their leader thus severelyhandled. The victor granted them all their lives,but took possession of their vessel, and detainedthem prisoners.When he came in sight of the French harbour,Wallace alarmed the place by displaying the ro¬ver’s colours, as if De Longueville was coming topillage the town. The bells were rung backward ;I horns were blown, and the citizens were hurryingi to arms, when the scene was changed. The Scot-| fish lion on his shield of gold was raised above thepiratical flag, and announced that the Championi of Scotland was approaching, like a falcon withI' his prey in his clutch. He landed with his pri¬soner, and carried him to the court of France,where, at Wallacfe’s request, the robberies whichthe pirate had committed were forgiven, and theK ing even conferred the honour of knighthood onSir Thomas de Longueville, and offered to takehim into his service.

Wishing, if poss.ible, toavoief ^hjsi the candidatqs agreed to refer their jclaims to. Edwaifcl .L of.^ngiand, one qf the most,politic and enterprising monarchs of .the day, andto 'abide hy his decision. Edward hail longwished ,to annex Scotland to his own dominions,and the authority of umpire afforded him a pre-executing Ids bmhitiou^s^hpqiejj pUncier.the guise of examining the .question with.moresolemnity, he summoned the Scots Barqqs to^qfhani,, where, oyera.we.cf by his pqwer, pr,,wonby his artifieps, lid prevailed on all pres.eq.t, notexcepting Bruce and BpHol, to acknowledge himLord Paramount of Sept land, and stj;ear fealty to.h^mjm^^t^harjpc^er-^^. 9(|jIt- was on this occasion urged liy jld^ard, thatthe English monarch? were the natural and ac¬knowledged superiors qf the kingdom P.f Scotland,which • was only an. appanage^1^‘jUje .Englishcrown; and that, at difl'cronl periods, this righthad-been authenticated by th.e liomage of theScottisli princes. The, fact was,, t^at these actsof fealty were only rendered lor pdsfsgsslqii? of thedcottidi sovereigns iymg. on the ndrfh.eyp frosnit rof the English dominions, namely, for those.f'racfacomprehended in -the modern counties of .North¬umberland, Durham, See.' These territories, fromtisek’ lying on the threshold of .the f.w.o kingdoms,had formed the ihcnlre of many sanguinary con¬flicts,'and had at divers times changed masters, tillifiey came at last to |>e considered a? belonging' 8 ‘to'Scotlhnd. For these possessions it had beenthe practice of some of the Scottish kings, at dif¬ferent periods, to do homage, though riot regular¬ly, and with little solemnity. Nor was this anuriusual occurrence. Under the genius of thefeudal system; where conquests were often pushedarid mairitairied in the dominions of neighboucingprinces, kings were at times found performinghomage to those’of far inferior note for tracts ofland acquired in this manner; and instances werenbt awanting of the English monarchs themselvesrendering that sort of subjection to the kings ofFrance. It was now contended, however, byEdward, that the homage or fealty on these occa¬sions had been done for the entire kingdom ofScotland.But this claim was only a prelude to a moreimportant step; for Edward, that he might beable to bestow the kingdom on the successful can¬didate, demanded and obtained possession of allthe fortresses in the kingdom, with the exceptiononly of the castles of Dundee and Forfar, whichGilbert de Umfraville, earl of Angus, refused tosurrender, until a written deed was executed, ex¬culpating hitn for delivering up to the king ofEngland what he held in (rust for the Scottishnation. At last, on the 17th November, 1292,Edward decreed the claim of Baliol to be thepreferable one, and he having once more swornfealty to that monarch, was placed by him on thethrone.Baliol was soon sensible of the humiliated con¬dition to which he had reduced himself, and thefeeble tenure by which he held his dignity, forevery opportunity that could serve to remind himof his state of vassdlage and dependence, wasseized upon by Edward with avidity. Indeed, soJiJ9much was this the case, that even the passivespirit of Baliol could no longer brook the insultsto which he was exposed ; but, uniting with hisnobles, he disclaimed the homage demanded byEdward as Lord Paramount of Scotland. “ Thesilly traitor,” said Edward, in disdain, when hereceived the news of Baliol’s refusal to attend hissummons, 4< if he come not to us, we will go tohim.” Having entered Scotland, and defeated theScots army at Dunbar, one stronghold yieldedafter another, almost without resistance. Edin¬burgh Castle surrendered, after a short siege;Stirling was abandoned ; the spirit of the wholenation sunk in despondency ; and Baliol, seeingno further hope of effectual resistance, submittedto the mercy of the conqueror.Edward had been joined in this invasion byBruce and his adherents, to which this noblemanwas induced by the hope of obtaining the for¬feited kingdom of his rival. The wary monarchknew how to keep alive these delusive eflectations,and turn them to bis own advantage; but onBruce mentioning bis claims, after Baliol and hisson were made prisoners, he contemptuouslyasked, Have we nothing else to do but to con¬quer kingdoms for you ?”—Bruce silently retired,and passed the remainder of his days in opulentobscurity.At Elgin, in the month of July, 1296, Edwardterminated his northern expedition. In his pro¬gress southward he destroyed or carried off allthe national registers and records, and caused thestone, upon which the Scottish monarchs werecrowned at Scone, to be removed to Westminster,as an evidence of his conquest, hoping, by thisseverity, to subdue the hitherto unconquerableaversion of the Scots to his government, andnblitcriUe all traces of their former independence.It¥&Vjthe ini'pqUey oT iht me^urc^'' adopted byKijij to, hunibk' the .jsilinti ql the fccyts was soonTiii)vip.tis, for, in It-a-i than c )par niter, ho iiad,cv^rcun tii« coMiUrj^ th.o. nation, irritated•beyOBa.enclu-ran^e, was ulaiijst every '.ohere ripe for revolt,Hcoliaiut, .fif'tkis Befioci, irecrt»i;eci vi«iji:n1ea, e<?nr-_vge, lih-radt'', and s.eeiciriUoii in ;!• toiei;s, mn'lltd,ward's aiiidsteis-disrday'ed liuu&.ol jUese.qualitiesiii ffctrnier... jljace, tnutfo 'Ifis iip.pedrance. lie w.as.by.nature fonricd to cbihuiai;^, for v.ifh a firni, dn-dau nted? and energetic an ad, he jvos.-'Cssed a phy¬sical strength tli^t sip fatigue cpujd overoome, nitda stature which remit!fed his attack irresi.table—invaluable qualities, 'where .w touch depended onpersonal intrepidity and strenglh, while Ins affa¬bility co'nctliatbd the affections of his ipliptvoys,^unci his eldquetico moulded their passions to hiswill.

They came up with theScottish army, advantageously posted near Irvine,far superior to them in numbers, but badly armedand undisciplined, and still more enfeebled fromdissention. All the leaders were independent, andall untractable. They could agree upon no mea¬sure for the benefit of the common cause ; andSir Richard de Lundin, who had hitherto madeno submission to Edward, openly went over tothe English with his followers, justifying himselfby saying, “ I will remain no longer will) a partythat is at variance with itself.” His example wassoon after followed by Bruce, the Stewart, Lind¬say, dud Douglas, submitting to the authority ofEdward’s officers.Our hero, who had taken no part in thesenegotiations, scornfully refused all compromise,and, collecting the faithful companions of hisfortunes, escaped to the north, where he was soonjoined by new followers ; for even the vassals ofthose barons that so lately had made their peace,flocked to his banners, in contempt of the alle¬giance they owed their masters. The bishop ofGlasgow, and Sir William Douglas, unable tofulfil the engagements they had contracted, andbeing unsafe among their countrymen, deliveredthemselves up to the English. Wallace, ascribingthis conduct of Wischeart’s to treacherous coward¬ice, in the warmth of resentment pillaged hiseffects and made his family prisoners.After ravaging the country, Wallace laid siegeto Dundee, at that time a place of considerableimportance. The English commanders preparedI13to pursue him, and for that purpose advanced toStirling. At the news of their approach, Wallacecharged the citizens, under pain of death, to con¬tinue the blockade of the castle, and hastenedhimself to seize on the pass between the Ochitand Grampian Plills, so that when the Englisharmy came to'cross the Forth at Stirling they saw! the patriots, on a rising ground, near the Abbeyof Cambuskennetb, ready to oppose their passage.Warrenne endeavoured to practise the same arts, which had been so successfully employed at Irvine,but without effect, for Wallace was not nowthwarted or controlled by the counsels of thosefickle and perfidious barons with whom he hadformer! v been surrounded. “■ Return,” said he,to two friars; sent by Warrenne to negotiate termsof peace, “ we came not here to treat, hut to as¬sert our rights, and set Scotland free. Let themadvance, they will find us prepared.”-Thus disappointed, the English commandersI hesitated and disagreed with regard to the planI they should adopt. To march along the bridge,) in order to attack the Scottish camp, would haveI been forfeiting all the advantages arising froma superiority of numbers, and exposing the army toE Inevitable defeat ; to remain inactive was judged| disgraceful; while an endeavour to penetrate intoIthe north by another way, and relinquish theirpresent position, would expose the southern coun¬ties to the fury of the Scots. Deliberation provedI fruitless; despising, therefore, an enemy they hadso often conquered, and urged on by the rasimessof Cressingham, who passionately exclaimed,‘£ Why do we thus protract the war, and wastei the king’s treasures? Let us fight, as is ourI bounden duty.” The English at last determined; to attack the Scottish camp by advancing along the. ..,,.,,11^^09 1 . • u r„ . „ ,situate at tlj'e entram’S 'of a pass’ beCwietr.ihenjjpuntams, on a I jsi.ap ground, i avin" uie riverForth uT'fronta;:Y! . s r.t: '".i - '.i'.h i:cgau‘ (p de-!i!.: ah;::..; ; d- id t'a n-£ • aij wereacross,’ wliiVtf'th<y'e^\f'f/u^l>'ad ’i hsed ‘were »ti|\— ap1 \ya»therest'■ o - . 3. ,, 'iVa^"- 'A -.iknicseized the Kng|»sfi Wfeo iaai fieri) speetainrs 61 thet^U ,tdi their «)nsp.<4?i^ts,. they 'hurrit -u'ie liri'dge,'i ^ije^ted hi' t!j,e'yJ^Vdit VonFusio'h. to Iter.vick,l^asjpjg .tjifif bi-prpa ia ilie liae.ds of the c -n-♦ .Hy.'-' -if a oa r.

But danger of amore serious nature now threatened this unhappycountry, for Edward, who had gone over to Flan¬ders before the battle of Stirling, where he re¬mained till the spring of 1298, now summonedthe Scottish nobles to a parliament at York. They,partly from a dread of Wallace, and partly fromaversion to the king, disobeved his summons. Up¬on this Edward raised a formidable army, com¬posed of 3000 horsemen, armed at all points, andupwards of 4000 horsemen in armour, but whosehorses were not armed. The kin<r desired no in-» Ofantry, but volunteers, and their numbers amount¬ed to 80,000. At the head of this numerous andwell disciplined army he advanced to subjugateScotland. Few of the principal barons joined thenational standard; those whose names are re¬corded were, Cumming of Badenoch ; Sir JohnStuart of Bonkill, brother to the Steward; Sir JohnSraham of Abercorn ; and Macduff, grand-uncle ofthe Earl of Fife. Bruce again united himself withthe patriots, and, with his vassals guarded thecastle of Ayr, a place of great importance, as itkept open the communication between Galloway,Argyllshire, and the isles.The castle of Dirleton alone offered any vigo¬rous resistance to Edward in his progress throughthe south-east counties ; but it yielded at last toBeck, bishop of Durham, to whom the care of thesiege had been committed. Until the victualling-ships should arrive, Edward fixed his headquar¬ters at Templelistou, a village situated betweenLinlithgow and Edinburgh, and here, a danger-rous mutiny having broke out in his camp, and his17I i- j ~ • i '..-vl n' - S ? r< v:# * j..*! r.,vf f. .. r, ffleet, baffled by eontrary winds, not arriving, hewas reluctantly compelled to order a retreatWhile making preparations for this purpose intel¬ligence was brought Him that the Scots had advan¬ced to Falkirk. This changed his Resolution.Judging that such a measure, with an enemy hang-,1 ing on his rear, well skillecl in desultory warfare,(would be attended with ruin and defeat, especiallyiwhen under the command of a man of such enter¬prise and conduct as Wallace, he turned his marchagainst them. The English passed the night underarms, on a heath, near Linlithgow, where an acci-ident occurred which had nigh proved fatal to thefuture hopes of Edward. As he slept on theiground, beside his war-horse, the animal suddenlyI struck his master with suqh violence as to break twoof his ribs. An alarm spread that he was killed ;i, but Edward, mounting his horse, regardless ofbodily pain, shewed himself to his troops, and in¬stantly led them to battle.Wallace drew up his infantry in four circularbodies, and disposed the archers, who were com¬manded by Sir John Stewart, in the intervals.I The horse, amounting only to a 1000, were in thei rear, and. a morass covered their front. Havingif made these dispositions he jocularly observed,II “ Now, I have brought you to the ring, hop gif1 you can.”.—That is, “ Dance if you have skill.”Edward’s chief Reliance was on his cavalry, which) were in three divisions, one comipanded by Bigot,: Earl Marshall; the second by the bishop of Dur¬ham, having under him Sir Ralph Basset of Dray¬ton; and the third by the king in person.

Si: I ...oy2<rmeah to deliver my country from oppression andslavery, and to support a just cause which you haveabandoned. You, my lord, whose right may1 en¬title you to be king, yon ought to protect thekingdom ; it is because you do it not, that I mustand will, while I breathe, endeavour the defence ofthat country I was born to serve, and if providencewill have it so, to die for. As for you, who, inplace of exerting your talents to turn the tide ofbattle in yoyr country’s favour, choose rather tolive a slave, if with safety to your life and fortune,than free, with the hazard of losing the latter, youmay remain in possession of what you so muchvalue, while the hollow praises of your enemiesmay blind you to the enormity of your conduct ;but remember, my lord, they w’hom you are thus |aiding to bind the yoke of slavery on the necks ofyour countrymen, will not long consider that con¬duct praiseworthy in you, which they would con¬demn as infamous in themselves ; and if they aresuccessful in rivetting our chains, you w'ill findyour reward in the well-earned contempt of theoppressor, and the hearty execrations of the op-ressed. Pause, therefore, my lord, and reflect: ifyou have but the heart to claim the crown, youmay win it with glory, and wear it with it justice ;I can do neither, but what I can I will, live anddie and freeborn subject.”Tradition has preserved many other circum- Istances relative t<\this battle, the remembrance of fwhich is fondly cherished by every native of thenorthern part of this island. One may serve asan example. It is said that Wallace, after thebattle of Falkirk, hid himself in an oak tree inthe Torwood, and this tree is in some degree heldsacred. Pieces of it having been carried off, andpreserved as relics; and some years ago, a snuff-!)ox made of it, elegantly mounted with gold", waspresented by the earl of Buchan to General Wash,ington, accompanied by a very flattering letter.The box was returned to his Lordship on theI General’s decease.After repairing the castle of Stirling, which the! Scots had burned in their retreat, Edward march*i ed west, and Bruce, at his approach, burnt thei castle of Ayr; hut his fleet not arriving with sup-j plies, and the country ill affording the means ne-i cessary for subsisting such a numerous body off troops, Jte was obliged to retire from Scotland.i This he did, after taking Bruce’s castle at Loeh-II maben, by the western borders. Edward had no.! sooner left the country, than the Scots ralliedii again, and again endeavoured to retrieve theirbroken fortunes ; for all the tract north of theI Forth, as also Galloway, was still in their posses-| sion. By general consent, William Lamberton,1 bishop St Andrew’s, Robert Bruce, earl of Car-i rick, and John Gumming, the younger, were chosenpi guardians of the kingdom, but Wallace was nowI lost to its cause. Borne down by the jealousy ofi rival nobles, having lost his personal friends, andb disgusted with those who deserted him in the bat-| tie of Falkirk, he no longer retained any commandIi in the armies, or influence in the councils of the1 nation he had freed. The guardians, however,continued the war with various success until theyear 13(H, when they and their followers havingmade peace with Edward the whole kingdom sub¬mitted to his authority.By the conditions of the treaty entered into onthis occasion, the following were accepted :—Wis-cheart, bishop of Glasgow, the Steward, Sir JohnSoulis, David de Graham, Alexander de Lindsay,• Simon Fraser, Thomas Bois, and Wallace.

The more narrowly the character ofWallace is examined, the more interesting it ap¬pears, for his love of country was unmingled withany base or selfish motive. His ruling passionwas a love of liberty, and an averion to the domi- ination of Edward, which never forsookJiim For- idun relates concerning him, that when Edward jmade very liberal oflbrs to induce him to submit,as many of bis countrymen had done, and some ofbis own friends joined in endeavouring to per¬suade him, 'Wallace with much emotion exclaim¬ed, “0 Scotland, too credulous of fair speeches,and not aware of the calamities which are comingupon you, if you were to judge as I do, you wouldnot easily put your neck under a foreign yoke.—When I was a hoy, the priest, my uncle, careful¬ly inculcated upon me this proverb, which I thenlearned, and have ever since kept in my mind :—“ I tell you a truth, liberty is the best of tilings.My son, never live under a slavish bond. There¬fore, I shortly declare, that if all others, the na¬tives of Scotland, should obey the king of Eng¬land, I and my associates, who may be willing!to adhere to me in this point, will stand for theliberty of the kingdom, and, by God’s assistance,will only obey the king or his lieutenant. ”*** For an additional account of the struggles farthe Independence of Scotland, see the Life ofKING ROBERT BRUCE.

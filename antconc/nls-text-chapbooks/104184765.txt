(8)“ They sung, how in the conqueror’s fleet“ Lord William shipp’d his powers,« And gain’d a fair young Saxon bride“ With all her lands and towcrs.(9)“ Then journeying to the Holy Land,<• There bravely fought and died ;“'.But first the silver crescent wan,“ Some Paynim Soldan’s pride.« They sung how Agnes, beauteous heir,« The queen’s own brother wed,“ Lord Joceline, sprung from Charlemagne,« In princely Brabant bred. (10)« How he the Percy name reviv’d,« And how his noble line,« Still foremost in (heir country’s cause,« With godlike ardour shine!”12With loud acc-laiir.j the listening ciowdApplaud the master’s song,And deeds of » ar and arms becameThe theme o' every tongue.Now high heroic acts they tell,Their perils past recall;When, lo! a damsel, young and fair.Stepp’d forward through the hall.She Bertram courteously address’d ;And kneeling on her knee,—Sir knight, the lady of thy loveHath sent this gift to thee.Then forth she drew a glitt’ring helm .,Well plated many a fold,The casque was wrought of temper’d steel,The crest of burnish’d gold.Sir knight, thy lady sends thee this,And yields to be thy bride.When thou hast prov’d this maiden giftWhere sharpest blows are tried.Young Bertram took the shining holme,And thrice he kiss’d the same;Trust me, I’ll prove this precious casqueWith deeds of noblest fame.Lord Percy and his barons boldThen fix upon a day.To scour the marches, late oppress’d,And Scottish wrongs repay.The knights assembled on the hills,A thousand horse and more :Brave Widdrington, tho’ sunk in years.The Percy standard bore.Tweed’s limpid current soon they pass.And range the borders round ;Down the green slopes of TiviotdaleTheir bugle-horns resound.As when the lion in his denHath heard the hunter’s cries.And rushes forth to meet his foes,So did the Douglas rise.Attendant on the chief’s command,A thousand warriors wait ;And now the fatal hour drew onOf cruel, keen debate.13A chosen troop of Scottish youthsAdvanc’d before the rest;Lord Percy mark’d their gallant mien,And thus his friend address’d :Now, Bertram, prove thy lady?s helme,Attack yon forward band ;Dead or alive I’ll rescue thee,Or perish by their hand.Young Bertram bow’d with glad assentAnd spurt’d his eager steed,And calling on his lady’s name,Rush’d forth with whirlwind speed.As when a grove of sapling oaksThe livid lightning rends ;So fiercely ’mid the opposing ranks,Sir Bertram’s sword descends.This way and that be drives the steelAnd keenly pierces through ;And many a tall and comely knightVV ith furious force he slew.Now closing fast on every side.They hem Sir Bertram round :But dauntless he repels their rage,And deals forth many a wound.The vigour of his single armHad well nigh won the field;When ponderous fell a Scottish axe,And clove his lifted shield.Another blow his temples took,And reft his helme in twain ;That beauteous helme, his lady’s gift His blood bedew’d the plain.Lord Percy saw his champion fallAmid the unequal fight:And now, my noble friends, he said,Let’s save this gallant knight.Then rushing in, with uplift shield,He o’er the warrior hung;As some fierce eagle spreads her wingTo guard her callow young.Three times they strove to seize their prey.Three times they quick retire :What force could stand his furious stroke,Oi meet his martial fire !d<11 w'j'lde'.14Now gathering round on every part,The battle rag’d amain ;And many a lady wept her lord,That hour untimely slain.Percy and Douglas, great in arms.There all their courage showed ;And all the field was strew’d with dead,And all with crimson flowed.At length the glory of the dayThe Scots reluctant yield ;And after wond’rous valour shown.They slowly quit the field.All pale extended on their shields,'And weltering in his gore.Lord Percy’s knights their bleeding friendTo Wark’s fair castle bore.(ll)Well hast thou earn’d my daughter’s love.Her father kindly said:And she herself shall dress thy wounds.And tend thee in thy bed.A message went ; no maiden came jFair Isabel ne’er appears :Beshrew me, said the aged chief.Young maidens have their fears.Cheer up, my son, thou shall her see,So soon as thou canst ride :And she shall nurse thee in her bower,And she shall be thy bride.Sir Bertram at her name reviv’d.He bless’d the soothing sound ;Fond hope supply’d the nurse’s care.And heal’d his ghastly wound.THE HERMIT OF WARKWORTH.PART THIRDOne early morn, while dewy dropsHung trembling on the tree,Sir Bertram'from his sick-bed rose,His bride ha would go see.A brother he had in prime of youth,Of courage firm and keen.And he would tend him on the way.Because his wounds were green.All day o’er moss and moor they rode,By many a lonely tower •,And ’twas the dew-fall of the ni^htEre diey drew near her bower.Most drear and dark the castle seem'd,That wont to shine so bright;And long and loud Sir Bertram call’dEre he beheld a light.At length her aged nurse arose.With voice so shrill and clear;What wight is this that calls so loud,And knocks so boldly here?’Tis Bertram calls, thy lady’s love,Come from his bed of care:All day I’ve ridden o’er moor- and mossTo see thy lady fair.Now out, alas! (she loudly shriek’d)Alas ! how may this be?For six long days are gone and pastSince she set out to thee.Sail terror seiz’d Sir Bertram’s heart.And ready was to fall;When now the drawbridge was let down.And gates were open’d all.Six days, young knight, are past and goneSince she set out to thee ;And sure, if no sad harm had happ’d,Long since thou wouldst her sec.For when the heard thy grievous chance,She tore her hair and cried,Alas! I’ve slain the eomeliest knight,All through my foolish pride!And now to atone for my sad fault.And his dear health regain.I’ll go myself, and nurse my love,And soothe his bed of pain.Then mounted she her milk-white steedOne morn at break of day ;And two tall yeomen went with herTo guard her on the way.Sad terror smote Sir Bertram’s heart.And grief o’erwhelm’d his mind ;Trust me, said he, 1 ne’er will restTill 1 thy lady find.16That night he spent in soir vv and care,And with sad Ixxling heart..Or ere tiie duwadiig of the day,His brother and lie depart.Now, brother, we’ll our ways divide.O’er Scottish hills to range:Do thou go north, and I 11 go west jAnd all our dress wo’U change.Some Scottish carle hath seiz’d my love.And home her to his den ;And ne’er will I tread English groundTill she’s restor’d again.The brothers straight their paths divideO’er Scottish hills to range;And hide themselves in quaint disguise.Ami oft their dress they change.Sir Bertram clad in gown of grey,Most like a palmer poor,To halls and castles wanders round.And begs from door to door.Sometimes a minstrel’s garb he wears,With pipes so sweet and shrill;And wends to every tower and town,O'er ev’ry dale and hill.One day as he sat under a thorn,All sunk in deep despair,An aged pilgrim pass’d him by,Who mark'd his face of care.All minstrels yet that e’er I saw,Are full of game and glee,But thou art sad and woe-begoue,I marvel whence it be.Father, I serve an aged lord,Whose griefs afiiiet my mind.His only child is stolen away,And fain 1 would her find.Cheer up, my son ; perchance, he said.Some tidings 1 may bear-:For oft when human hopes have fail’d,Then heavenly comfort’s near.Behind yon hills so steep and high,Down in a lonely glen.There stands a castle fair and strong,Far from th. abode ot men.1?As late 1 chiinc'iJ to crave an alms,About ihis evening hour,Me-thought I heard a lady’s voiceLamenting in the tower.And when I asked what harm had happ’dWhat lady sick there lay ?They rudely drove me from the gate,And hade me wend away.The e tidings caught Sir Bertram’s rar.He thank’d him for his tale;And soon he hasten’d o’er the hilli,And soon he reach’d the vale.Then drawing near those lonely towns,W hich stood in Dale so low,And sitting down beside the gate.His pipes he ’gan to blow.Sir Porter, is thy lord at home,To hear a minstrel’s song ?Or may I crave a lodging liere,Without offence or wrong?■My lord, he said, is not at home,To hear a minstrel’s song:And should I lend thee lodging here.My life would not belong.He play’d again so soft a strain,Such power sweet sounds impart.He won the churlish porter’s ear,And mov’d his stubborn heart.Minstrel, he said, thou play’st so sw'eet.Fair entrance thou shouldst win ;But, alas! I’m sworn upon the rood,To let no stranger in.Yet, minstrel, in yon rising cliff,Thou’lt find a sheltering cave ;And here thou shatt my supper share}And there thy lodging have.All day he sits beside the gate,And pipes both loud and clear;All night he watches round the walls,In hope’s his love to hear.The firstnight, as he silent watch’d,All at the midnight hour,He plainly heard his lady’s voiceLamenting in the tower.ItThe sei<M.«i night tne .noon shone clcai,And gilt the spangled dew ;He saw Ids lady through the grate,But ’twas a transient view.The thild night, wearied out, he sleptTill near the morning tide ;When, starting up, he seiz’d his swordAnd to the castle hied.When, lo! he saw a ladder of ropesDepending from the wall;Ami o’er the moat was newly laidA poplar strong and tall.Ami soon he saw his love descend,Wrapt in a tartan plaid ;Assisted by a sturdy youthIn Highland garb yclad.Amaz’d, confounded at the sight,He lay unseen and still;And soon he saw them cross the stream,And mount the neighbouring hill.Unheard, unknown to all within,The youthful couple fly,But what can ’scape the lover’s ken,Or shun his pitreing eje ?With silent step he follows closeBehind the flj ing pair,And saw her hang upon his armWith fond familiar air.Thanks, gentle youth, she often said,My thanks thou'well hast won;For me what wiles hast thou contriv’d!For me wiiat dangers run !And ever shall my grateful heartThy services repay :—Sir Bertram would no further hear,But cried, “ Vile traitor, stay !”“ Vile traitor, yield that lady up !”And quick his sword he drew ;The stranger turn’d in sudden rage.And at Sir Bertram flew.With mortal hate their vigorous armsGave many a vengeful plow;But Bertram’s stronger hand prevail'd,And laid the stranger low.11)Die, traitor, die !—A deadly tlirnsiAttends each furious word;All! then fair Isabel knew hiy voice,And rush’d beneath bis sword.Ostop, she cried, O stop thy arm!Thou dost thy brother slay!—And here the hermit paus’d and wept;His tongue no more could say.At length he cried—Ye lovely pair,How shall I tell the rest!Ere 1 could stop my piercing sword,It fell and stabb’d her breast!Wert thou thyself that hapless youth ?Ah! cruel fate! they said—The hermit wept, and so did ihey ;They sigh’d ; he hung his head.0 blind and jealous rage, he cried,What evils from thee flow!The hermit paus’d; they silent mourn’d;He wept, and they were woe.Ah! when 1 heard my brother’s name,l saw my lady bleed,1 rav’d, 1 wept, I curs’d my armThat wrought the fata! deed.In vain I clasp’d her to my breast,And clos’d the ghastly wound;In vain I press’d his bleeding corpse,And rais’d it from the ground.My brother, alas! spake never more;His precious life was flown,She kindly strove to soothe my pain,Regardless of her own.Bertram, she said, he comforted,And live to think on me:May we in heaven that union prove.Which here was not to be !Bertram, she said, I still was true!Thou only hadst my heart:May we hereafter meet in bliss !We now, alas! must part.For thee I left my father’s hall,And flew to thy relief;When, lo ! near Cheviot’s fatal hills1 met a Scottish chief.20LordJVlalcoIm’s son, whose proffer’d loveI had refused with scorn ;He slew my guards and seiz’d on meUpon that fatal morn ;And in these dreary, hated walls,He kept me close confin’d;And fondly sued and warmly press’dTo win me to his mind.Each rising morn increas’d my pain,Each night increas’d my fear;When wand’ring in this northern gaibThy brother found me here.He quickly form’d his brave design,To set me captive free;And on the moor his horses wait,Tied to a neighbouring tree.Then haste, my love, escape away,And for thyself provide ;And sometimes fondly think on herWho should have been thy bride.Thus pouring comfort on my soul,Even with her latest breath,She gave one parting fond embrace.And clos’d her eyes in death.In wild amaze, in speechless woe ;Devoid of sense 1 lay :—Then sudden, all in frantic mood,I meant myself to slay.And rising up in furious haste,I seiz’d the bloody brand ;A sturdy arm here interpos’d,And wrench’d it from my hand.A crowd that from the castle came.Had miss’d their lovely ward :And seizing me, to prison bare,And deep in dungeon barr’d.It chanc’d that on that very mornTheir chief was prisoner ta’en ;Lord Percy had us soon exchang’d.And strove to soothe my pain.And soon those honour’d dear remainsTo England were convey’d ;And there within their silent tombs,With holy rites were laid.21For me, I loatli’d my wretched lifeAnd long to end it thought;Till time, and books, and holy me.'!Had better counsels taught.They rais’d my heart to that pure sourcWhence heavenly comfort flows :They taught me to despise the world.And calmly bear its woes.No more the slave of human pride.Vain hope, and sordid care ;I meekly vowed to spend my lifeIn penitence and prayer.The bold Sir Bertram now no more,Impetuous, haughty, w ild ;But poor ami humble Benedict,Now lowly, patient, mild.My lands I gave to feed the poor.And sacred altars raise ;And here a lonely Anchorite,I came to end my days.This sweet sequester’d vale I chose.These rocks and hanging grove.For oft beside that murm’ring stream.My love was wont to rove.My noble friend approv’d my choice jThis blest retreat he gave;And here I carv’d her beauteous form,And scoop’d this holy cave.Full fifty winters, all forlornMy life I’ve linger’d here;And daily o’er this sculptur’d saint1 drop the pensive tear.A ad thou, dear brother of my heart.So faithful and so true,The sad remembrance of thy fateStill makes my bosom rue !Yet not unpitied pass’d my life,Forsaken or forgot.The l\rcy and his noble sonsWould grace my lowly cot.Oft the great F.arl from toils of state,And cumbrous pomp of power,Would gladly seek my little rc]lTo suend Uie tranquil hour.22But length of life is length of woe^1 liv’d to mourn his fall :1 liv’d to mourn his godlike sonljAnd friends and followers all.But tjiou the honours of thy race,Lov’d youth, shalt now restore,And raise again the Percy nameMore glorious than b.efore.He ceas’d, and on the lovely aairHis chosen blessings laid :While they with thanks and pity ing tears,His mournful tale repaid.And now what present course to takeThey ask the good old sire ;And, guided by his sage advice,To Scotland they retire.Meantime their suit such favour found,At Baby’s stately hall,Earl Neville and his princely spouseNow gladly pardon all.She suppliant at her nephew’s throne,The royal grace implor’d :To all the honours of the raceThe Percy was restor’d.The youthful Earl still more and moreAdmir’d the beauteous dame;Nine noble sons to him sire bore.All worthy of their name.23N O T E S.(1) Robert Stuart, Duke of Albany.(2) Ralph Neville, first Earl of Westmoreland, who chiefly re¬sided at bis two castles of Brancepeth and Baby, both in thebishopric of Durham..loan, Countess of Westmoreland, mother of the young lady,was daughter of lohn of Gaunt, and half sister of King Henry IV.(4) Adjoining to the cliff which contains the Chapel of the Her¬mitage, are the remains of a small building, in which the hermitdwelt. This consisted of one lower apartment, with a little bed¬chamber over it, and is now in ruins; whereas the Chape), cut inthe solid rock, is still entire and perfect.(b) In the little island of Coquet, near Warkworth, are still seenthe ruins of a Cell, which belonged to the Benedictine monks pfTynemouth Abbey.tG) This is a Bull’s Head, the crest of the Widdritigton familyAll the ’figures, &e. here described are still visible, only somewhateffaced with length of time.(7) Widdrington Castle, about five miles south of Warkworth.(8) In Lower Normandy are three places of the name of Firry;whence the family took the surname De Percy.(9) William de Percy, (fifth in descent from Galfrcd or Gaffreyde Percy, son of Mainfred) assisted in the conquest of England,and had given him the large possessions in Yorkshire of Emma <!<•Porte, (so the Norman writers name her) whose father, a greatSaxon Lord, had been slain fighting along with Harold. Thisyoung lady, William, from a principle of honour and generosity,married ;—for having had all her lands bestowed on him by theConqueror, “ he,” to use the words of the old Whitby Chronicle,“wedded hyr that was very heire to them, in discharging ol hisconscience.” He died at Mountjoy, near Jerusalem, in the firstCrusade.(10) Agnes de Percy sole heiress of her house, married Josce-line de Louvaine, youngest son of Godfrey Barbatus, duke oBrabant, and brother of Queen Adeliza, second w ife of King Henry 1 , he took the name of Percy, and was ancestor of the Earls cNorthumberland.

It is now entirely destroyed.‘MTHE HERMITAGE.WAIiKWORTH CASTI.E, in Northumberland, stands veryboldly on a neck of land near the sea-shore, almost surrounded by the river Coquet (called by our old Latin historians |Ooqueda) which runs with a clear and rapid stream, but whenswollen with rains becomes violent and dangerous.About a mile from the Castle, in a deep romantic valley, arc theremains of a Hermitage; of which the Chapel is still entire. Thisis hollowed with great elegance, in a cliff neai»the liver; as arealso two adjoining apartments, which probably served for the Sa¬cristy and Vestry, or were appropriated to other sacred uses; forthe former of these, which runs parallel with the Chapel, appears jto have had an altar in it, for occasionally celebrating the mass.f'ach of the apartments is extremely small; for the principalChapel, in length, exceeds not 18 feet—and the breadth andheight not more than 7 feet and a half. It is, however, verybeautifully designed, and executed in the solid lock, and has allthe decoiations of a complete Gothic Cathedral in miniature.But what principally distinguishes the Chapel, is a small tombor monument on the south side of the altar; on the top of whichlies a female figure, extended in the manner that effigies are usual¬ly exhibited praying on ancient tombs. The figure, which is verydelicately designed, some have supposed to be the image of theVirgin Mary; but it has not the least resemblance to the mannerin which she is represented in the Romish Churches, where she isusually erect, as the object of adoration, and never in a prostraterecumbent posture. Indeed, the real image of the blessed Virginprobably stood in a small niche, still visible, behind the allar;whereas the figure of a Bull’s Head, which is rudely carved at theLady’s feet, the usual place for the Crest in old monuments, plain¬ly proves her to have been a very different personage.—About thetomb are several other figures cut in the natural rock, like thosebefore mentioned.

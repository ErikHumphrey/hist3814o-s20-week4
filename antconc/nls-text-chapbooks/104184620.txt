wand’ring thus, I ne’er could findA girl like blythsome Sally;Who picks, and culls, and cries aloud,“ Sweet lilies of the valley.”From whistling o’er the harrow’d turf.From nestling of each tree,I chose a soldier’s life to wed.So social, gay, and free:Yet tho’ the lasses love me well,And' often try to rally,None pleases me like her who cries,“ Sweet lilies of the valley.”I’m now return’d, of late discharg’d.To see my native soil;From fighting in my country’s cause.To plough my country’s soil:I care not which, with either pleas'd.So I possess my Sally,That little rnerry nymph, who cries,,f Sweet lies of the valley.”Paudien O'Rafferty.When I was a serving my time at Drogheda,,Minding my work, just as I ought to do.My master’s fair daughter, MissBiddy O’Dogherty,Bored a hole in the heart

on a billow,JFar, far at sea..All was dark, when she woke out of breath.Not an object her fears, could discover ;All was still as the silence of cleath.Save Fancy, which painted her lover,Far, far at sea.So she whisper’d a pray’r—clos’d .her eyes.But the phanton still haunted her pillow;While in terror she echcfd his cries.As struggling he sunk'in a billow.Far, far at sea.

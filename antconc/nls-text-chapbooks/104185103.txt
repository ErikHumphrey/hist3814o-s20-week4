David strengthened it with a castle, andbeautified it with palaces; after this Solomon enlarg¬ed it, and further beautified and fortified it, the pa¬lace, gates and wails could not be matched in all tb#world, and had within the walls one hundred andfifty thousand inhabitants, besides women and chil¬dren.The trenches about it were sixty foot deep cut out<*f a rock, and two hundred and fifty broad.

After eighteen months seige,in the eleventh year of Ze'Ukiah. the ninth day ottne fourth month, which was the eighteenth year otNebuchadnezzar’s reign the princess of Babylon sur¬prised apd took this brave city; presently after Nc-Buzradan, general of the Babylonian army, com¬manded by Nebuchadnezzar, spoiled the temple,carrying away the vessels of gold and silver, and thegreat lav*r given by king Solomon, and burned the•3temple the first day of the next month, which wastwenty one davs after the surprisal, 470 \e4rs sixmonths, and ten days after the foundation; 903j years six months, and ten days after the dap irtureof the people out of Egypt; 1760 years, and sixmonths after the flood; 3416 years, six months andten days after the creation. Thus, and then was theI city of Jerusalem taken, and for seventy years re¬mained the Jews in this captivity.It was built again by Nehemiah* Chron. i ii. iii. iv.The temple and city was spoiled again by BurgosesI Lieutenant to Artaxerexes then by I’tolomeuts thefirstthen by Antiochus Ephiphanes, and again by Appo-loniou$*S deputy; after which, it was taken by Pom-1; py, and robbed by Crassus in his Parthian expedition.IYet all the losses the temple and city sustained wererepaired by Herod the great, who enlarged the city,I new built the temple, and left it both stately and glo-I rious; it was compassed with three strong walls, the| third wall had ninty towers, fne second wdi hadj fourteen, and the old wall had sixtyo Agrippa built1a fourth wad ten cubits high, but did not finish it,lest Claudious Caeser should think he designed to re-i| bel: yet the Jews afterwards built it twenty cubitsIhigh, and raised a battlement two cubits, and builtthree towers thereon; All th^jr towers were builtof wiiite marble, each stone being twenty cubitslong, ten broad, and five thick; so curiously joined,that they seem’d but one stone, and the compass ofthe city, from the north to the west, was forty threefuriongs.Within the city was the king’s palaco surpassing all .in the world for largeness and workmanship, inviron-ed with a wall, which was thirty cubits high adorn¬ed with towers and beautified with houses to an hun¬dred of the nobility ; and in every room were manyvessels of gold and silver and porches adorned vvitjjcurious pillars, and many pleasant walks, with allmanner of trees and fountains, which spouted upwater, with cisterns and brazen statues, from whichran water continually.The temple was built upon a tocky mountain, andthe place at the top, was not at first big enough forthe temple and court, the hill being very steep, butthe people every day brought earth thither, and theyat last made it plain and large enough, with wonder¬ful curiosity and labour, inclosed with three wallswhich were many days labour, with the cost of all theholy treasure offered to God from all parts; the foun¬dation of the temple was laid three hundred cubitsdeep; the porches were double supported by manypillars twenty cubits high, all of one piece of marble,the tops of cyder so exactly wrought, as astonishedbeholders, the porches were thirty cabits broad, andthe compass of the temple was six furlongs; the courtswere curiously paved and wrought with all sorts ofstones, and the gates were covered with weighty platesof gold, only one with Corinthian brass, which forbeauty excelled the other, dazzling the eyes of thespectator.Then the Holy of Holies, or Sanctum Sanctorum,situate in the midst, had twelve stairs to get up to it,the fore part of it was an hundred cubits high, andas many broad, and backwards it was forty cubits on' each side. It had as it were two shoulders twentycubits high, and twenty five wide, and had no doorsto shew that heaven was always open. All the foreparts were gilded within and covered with fine gold,the inner part was divided into two rooms, whereofthe first only might be seen, which was in heightninety cubits, in length forty, and in breadth twenty.Round about the wall was a golden vine, whereonhung grapes in clusters, being six foot long; it hadgolden gates fifty five cubits high, and sixteen broad,(IIf1f:and curious bangings of the same length, wroughtwith purple, velvet, starlet and silk. All the fabricwas so exquisite and rich, that none could imagineand workmanship to be wanted, for it was all coveredwith massy plates of gold, which astonished the be¬holders; the tops was also set with rods of gold,sharp at the ends, lest birds should sit thereon, anddefile the holy place.Gur Saviour was born in the year of that world4004, and in the 4Sd year of Augustus Caesar manyremarkable things were seen in the heavens, whichcaused the wise men to conclude, that some morethan ordinary person would appear upon the earth,and the learned though! it to be Augustus Caesar,who then reigned prosperously: And others thought,it to be whom the prophet Isaiah speaks of, thatshould have the government on his shoulders, eventhe Saviour of the world, whom the Evangelistsmention the angels declared to the shepherds, andthe star directed the wise men of the east to find outthe place of his birth. So that,As the nexu earth with a new Sun was blest,So heaven with a new glorious star was drest.At Christ’s birth the temple of Rome, dedicated tothe God Pan, fell to the earth, and when it was builtthe Romans addressed to the oracle Apollo to knowhow long it should endure, who answered, Till a vir¬gin should bring forth a son, which they judged im¬possible, therefore they believed that their templeshould last eternally.That night that Christ was born, there appearedin Spain at midnight, a cloud with so great a light,that it seemed like mid-day. St. Jerome writes thatwhen the virgin fled with her son into Egypt, thatail the images of the. gods tumbled from their altarsto the very ground; and that the oracles or answers,ft****which these gods, or rather devils used to give themceased, and never answered" afterwards.The first year of Christ’s birth, there were manystrange things that happened in German)', and inRome, and a terrible eclipse of the sun. At tketwelfth year of his age he disputed with the doctors,and at that time there" appeared a terrible comet, thatthe light of the sun apparently failed, and the hea¬vens steemed to burn, and fire beams fell from them.In the 22d year of his age, several bloody cometsware seen, and the river lybar overflowed the city«f Rome.Publius LentuUuss Epistle to Rome concerningc h iu s r.There appeared in those days a man of great virtue©idled Jesus Christ, is yet living among us. and of thepeople is called a prophet; but his own disciples callhim the Son of God; he raiseth the dead, cureth al!atanner of diseases: a man of stature, fomewhat tallstnd comely with a reverend countenance, such as thebeholders nay both fear and love ; his hair is of thecolour of a chesnut full ripe, and plain down almostto his ears, but from thence downward somewhatcurled, but more orient of colours waving about hisshoulders; in midst oT his head goeth a seam of hishair, or parting, like that of the Nazarites; his fore¬head very plain and smooth ; his face without spot orwrinkle beautified with a comely red; his n®se and*nouth so formed that nothing can be reprehended,his beard thick, in colour of the hair of his head; hiseyes grey, clear and quick ; in reproving he is severe,iu counselling courteous and fair spoken; pleasant inspeech, mixed with gravity; it cannot be rememberedthat any have seen him laugh, but many have see*him weep; in proportion of body well shaped andHrstraight; his hands and arras very delectable to be¬hold. in speaking very tsraperate. modest and wise,a man for his singular beauty faf exceeding the sonsof men.• \V*thin the thirty third year of Christ’s life, he wasl crucified by the wicked hands of the Jews which©aused many miracles attested both by heathens and'! Christians. At his death there was a mighty dark¬ness : In the day t’me, from six till nine, that ie,from our twelve, to pur three in the afternoon, andyet no eclipse of the sun, it being fit I moon, sa it| was contrary to the' order of nature, but the powerof God deprived the sun of its light.Dennis the Areopagite, being that day in Athens,and seeing the darkness, cried with a ioud voice,Either the world is at an end, or the God of n durasuffers. Then the men of Athens being astonished,built an altar to the unknown God: and afterwards| St. Paul declared to them, That Christ who sufferedth?t day was the unknown God ; wheieby he con¬vene!) many to the Christian faith.it is likewise acknowledged by Plutarch, thougha heathen, that after the death of Christ, not only theoracles of Egypt ceased, but through ah the world,| of which he can give no reason being ignorant of,Christianity; however satan did plainly acknowledgehimself overcome by the death of Const, and couldnever give any answers afterwards. The words ofPlutarch to Emiiius the orator; concerning the mat¬ter, are, as follows. My lather coming by sea towardsItaly, and coasting by night about an island not in¬habited, called Paraxis, when most in the ship wereat rest, they heard a fearful voice which came frontthat island, that called on Alaman, who was pilotef the ship; and an Egyptian born, though his voicewas heard once or twice, yet no man had U\e cou¬rage to answer it till the third time, when the pilot%t8answered, Who is there ? Who is it that calls ? Whatwould you have ? When the voice spoke more high !and said, Alaman I require 'when you pass thegulph of Langu all you remember to call aloud, andmake them to understand that the great god Pan isdead. At these words all in the ship were astonished,and concluded that the pilot should not take noticeof the voice, nor stay in the gulph to utter such wordsif they could get beyond it: Now going on theirvoyage, and coming to the place before mentioned,the ship stood still, and the sea was calm, that theycould go no farther: Whereupon they resolved thatAlaman should perform his embassage, so he placedhimself upon the poop of the ship, and cried aloud,Be it known unto you that the great god Pan is dead.When he had uttered these'words, they heard manymournful cries, groans, and lamentations, that con¬tinued some time, which surprised those in the ship:But having a prosperous gale, they followed theircourse, and arrived at Rome, and told the adventure,and told Tiberius the Emperor, all the truth thereof.Where it is evident, that Sataa in all parts wasbanished by the death of, Christ, and it is supposedthat this god Ran is not to be restrained only to thegod of the shepheids, but was rather some masterdevil, who lost his power and empire, as the othershad done before, by the death of Jesus Christ.About forty years after the death of Christ, theJews had many warnings shewed them from heaven.Before Vespasion came, in the feast of weeks, thepriest heard a man walking in the temple, sayingwith a terrible voice, Come let us go av/ay out of thisplace, let us make away from hence.Now the sins of the Jews being come to the fullheight, who with cruel hands had crucified the Lordot Life, that innocent blood, which they desired mightfall on them and their children, it began now to b e9avenged upon them; for the civil wars were begunby Jehonanan and Simon, who destroyed all the cornand fruits without the city, and Jehonanan withinthe city ravished the citizens wives and daughtersand shed floods of innocent blood. The citizens be¬ing weary of this tyranny delivered the city to Si¬mon, thinking he would help them, but he joinedthe other rebel, and reigned month about, till at lastthey quarrelled between themselves*Then there was nothing but slaughters and bloodshed, so that the blood of the Jews ran thro’ the streetseven to the temple of the Lord, like a flood ; all thatthe seditious overcame they set their houses on fire,so that they burnt fourteen hundred store houses, thatwere full of corn, wine, and oil, which caused a sud¬den famine in Jerusalem. Thus God visited the citywith four plagues at once, viz. sword, pestilence,famine and fire ; to which the fifth was added, theruin and destruction of all the glorious buildings, sothat nothing but desolutions, pollutions of the templeand all holy things, and uproars, without any rest,no help, no succour, but every corner was full ofhowling, yelling, weeping, wailing, sobbing, andsighing of women and children, and aged men star¬ing for want of bread, and others roaring in theirwounds, so that all manner of miseries oppressed theinhabitants; for he was thought a happy man that wasdead before the day.At this time Vespasian, with his army was lying inGalilee, and from thence he went to Rome to receivethe imperial crown, and left Lis son Titus with thehalf of nis army to beseige Jerusalem, the other totarry at Alexandri till further orders. That I shalldo, (said Titus) dear father, for unto you it belong-eth to command, and me to obey.In the first year of the reign of Vespasian, Titusmustered his army, and found them sufficient for the10eiepe of Jerusalem, he then marched to Samaria andfrom thence to ■Vtelphia, thirty furlongs from Jerusa¬lem, where lie pitched his camp, and the next dayhe brought the whole army to Jerusalem, a little be¬fore the feast of unleavened bread, which was Aprilthe 14*th. so that an infinit number of the people, thatcame to celebrate, were all shut up in the city, whichraised a famine ; oxens dung was sold at a dear rate,so w s eld leatHfer, and some women for want, boiledtheir own children and did eat them.Now Titus approached the walls of the city, andpitched his camp upon the river Peleponina, raised amount, and with a battering ram broke into the cityMay 7th., and afterwards he raised four other mountsand made himself master of the second wsll, and builttwelve castles thereon, so that none could pass in orout, whereby the famine and pestilence raged withinand the swotd without the city, so that multitudesperished; for from April the 13, to July following,there vuxe buried by the common charge of the city,six hundred thousand carcases, and multitudes throwninto empty houses, and over the walls which fil edthe houses withllead bodies. Titus intended to savethe temple from fire, when some of the city was inflames by setting a guard upon it, but the seditiouswho raised the fire slew every man cf the j>uard, whichTitus hearing brought his whole army thitner. Atthat time a soldier of the seditious took a flaming firebrand, and cast it through the golden window intothe temple, and others set fire to the doors and • t .erthe gold grew hot, the temple began to burn, andimmediately the whole fabric was in a flame mdthe holy of holies was laid open to t«e view of allthere present.This happened the second year ot the reign ofVespasian : and the same month that it was bui ot byNebuchadnezzar, Titus drew his snvord to save die11' holy place, bat the flames rushed through all partsof the temple in a moment, so that none could saveit: the Jews seeing all go to destruction before theireyes, they then threw themselves into the flitnes,saying, why should we nve any- o g i ? Now thereill was no temple after the hoiy ot holies "'as burnt11 Titus entered it, and sa w the ghory of it. and said, Ii' well percieve that this is no other than the house of| God, and the dwelling place of the king of heaven;! the God cf heaven, who is God of this house, takei vengeance, on the seditious whose humous deedsI have brought this evil upon themselves, and this holy| place.On September the seventh Titus commanded allI, the lower city to be set on hire^ and assaulted the up-| per city, breaking over the fences, and destroyingi ail before them with fire and sword • then command¬ed the city and temple to be raized to the foundation,’and the ground to be forthwith plowed. And Je-honanan and Simon w-ere sent prisoners to Home,with seven hundred of the Jews; the book of thelaw, and the purple vail olTthe sanctuary were takenin triumph to Rome. About that time neither sueeor moon were seen for fifteen days, as Christ fore¬told Matth. xxiv. 1^,St, Jerome writes, that in this time, on (hat day ofthe y- ir wherein Jerusalem was taken by the Roman*you - 1 -ht have seen aged m m and women, and se¬ver : o-'ier wretched people, but pitied by none wh»wit oiubbered cheeks and di-chevelled hair, wentho- •: and lamenting tor the ruin of the templean ; u.uy, wearing and bearing in their habit*.an.’ ies, the sad. characters of divine vengence,ot .vho the soldiers exacted a fee for liberty of we m-ing , they who formerly sold the blood of Jesus,wer v forced to buy their own tears.1 i Roman soldiers being now quite spent with12doing execution, and having a great deal more of thatwork yet to do, Titus ordered his men to hold theirhands, saving only to those that they found armed,or in a posture of resistance, and give quarter to all therest. But the soldiers went beyond their commision,and put the aged and the sickly to the sword, pro¬miscuously, with their companions, and for those,that were strong and serviceable, they shut them upin the temple, in the women’s quarters. Caesar ap¬pointed Fromo, one of his friends and freemen, toinform him of the people, and to d® by them as theydeserved. As for the ruffians, and the seditious,that impeached one anotheryhe had them all put todeath ; but for men of comely and graceful persons, ]and in the prime of their youth, he reserved them jfor the triumph; sending away all of above seven¬teen of the remainder of them, in chains into Egypt, Ito be employed in servile offices and drugery: be- )sides those that were disttibuted up and down theprovinces for the use of theatres in the quality ofswords men or gladiators ; and all under seventeen heexposed to sale.In the meantime while the prisoners were underFronto’s charge, there wrere eleven thousand of themstarved to death, betwixt the churlishness of thekeepers that would give them no meat ; and thesqueemishness of their stomachs, that would swallownone. But in truth, the mouths were too many forthe provisions.The number of prisoners in this war was ninety ,seven thousand. The number of the dead was elevenhundred thousand ; the greater part of them Jewsby nation, tho’ not natives of Judea: for it was onlya general meeting of them at Jerusalem, gatheredtogether ftom all quarters to celebrate the feast ofthe passover; who were there suprised into a war.There was such a prodigious multitude, and they so13straitened for lodgings, that the croud first broughtthe plague into the town, and then quickly madeway for a famine, The city not being capable ofentertaining that vast body of people, if the calcula¬tion of Cestius may at least pass for any thing: As| follows.Nero had so great a contempt for the Jews, thatCestius made it his suit to the high priest to bethink[ themselves of some way of numbering their people:Aftd this he did out of a desire to give Nero to under-j stand, that the Jewish nation was not so dispiseableas he imagined; so that they took their time to en¬ter upon the computation, at the celebration of theirpaschal feast: When offering up sacrifice accordingto custom, from the ninth hour of the day to theeleventh, and the sacrifice to be eaten afterwards intheir families, by ten at least, and sometimes twentyto a lamb: They reckoned upon two hundred andsixty six thousand, five hundred oblations; which atj|j the rate of ten to a lamb, amounted to two millions,five hundred and sixty thousand persons, all pure andsound; for neither lepers, scorbutic, men troubledwith gonorhceas, women in their monthly sickness,or people labouring under any malignant distempers,were admitted to any part in this solemnity; Nomore were any strangers, but what came thither forreligion. So that this mighty concourse of peoplefrom abroad before the siege, was afterwards, by therighteous providence of God, cooped up in the cityas in a prison: and the number of the slain in thatsiege was the heaviest judgment of that kind thatever was heard of. Some were killed openly, otherskept in custody by the Romans who searched thevery sepulchres and vaults for them, and put all theyfound alive to the sword. There were upwards oftwo thousand that had either laid violent hands onthemselves, or killed one another by consent; besides14.those that perished by the famine. The jiutrid cor¬ruption of dead bodies sent out a vapour to prison asmany as came within the reach of it. Some werenot able to endure at, and so went out of the way;others had their hearts so set upon Sooty, that theyrifled the very carcases, and trampled upon the deadbodies as they lay soaking in their corruption; butavarice sticks at nothing. They brought out severalprisoners also that the two tyrants had laid in chainsthere ; for they kept up their cruelty to the last: ButGods justice overtook them b°th in the end; forJohn and his brethren in the vaults were now dri¬ven by the distress of an unsupportable-hunger, to begthat mercy of the Homans, that they had so often- despised : and Simon after a long struggle with an un-tupportable necessity, delivered up himself: The hit¬ler being reserved for the triumph, and John madaprisoner for life. The Romans, after this burnt theremainder of the city, and threw down the walls.The power of God on the one hand, and his good¬ness on the other, was very remarkable upon this oc¬casion : For the tyrants ruined themselves, by quit¬ting those holds o( their own accord, that could ne¬ver have been taken but by famine: And this afterthe Jews had spent so much iime to no purpose uponother places of less value. 83' this meai,s the Romansbecame masters of three impregnable forts, by fortunethat could never have been taken any other way:For the three famous towers before mentioned wereproof against all batteries.Upon Simon and John’s quitting these towers; orrather, upon their being driven out of them by theimpulse of jmlicial infatuation, they hastened awayto the vale of Siloa, where they took breath a while,and after some recollection, and refreshment, theygave an assault to the new wall there: ut so taintand weak, that the guards*bcat them oft’; for betweea15fatigue, despondency, dread and misery, their strengthfailed them, and they were tnfn scattered severalways into sinks and gutters.The Soldiers were ifnw bioken loose all over thetown, up and down in the/ streets, with their swordsdrawn, kiiiin" ail that fell in t'n^ir way without dis¬tinction: and burning entire hopses, and whateverwas in them, in one common fl mu. In several pla¬ces, where they entered to search for pillage, theyfound whole families dead, and houses crammedwith hunger starved carcases: So that upon the horrorof so hideous a spectacle, they came out again emptyhanded > but the compassion they had for the dead,made them not one jot tenderer to the living; forthey stabbed every man they met till t.e narrowpassages and alleys were choaked up with carcases,so that the channel of the city rah blood, as if it hadbeen to quench the fire. In the evening they gaveover killing and at night they fell afivsh to burning.The eighth ot the month Gorpieus put an end to theconflagration of Jerusalem. ( G D. 70.) and if all theblessings it ever enjoyed from the foundation of it,bad been but comparable in proportion to the cala¬mities it suffered in this siege, that city had been un¬doubtedly the envy of the world. But the greatestpiague of all c;.me out of its own bowels; in that in¬fernal race of,vipers that it brought fortirto eat outof the belly of the mother.While Titus was now ta ing a view of the ruinsef this glorious city ; the works, the fortifications, andespecially the turrets, which the tyiants hao so sot-tishly abandoned; while Caesar 1 say, was entertain¬ing himself in the contemplation of the height, dimen¬sions, and situation of these towers, the design, work-manrnip, and curiosity of the fabric, with tiie won¬derful contrivance ot the whole: He let fall this ex¬pression, Wdi says he God had not Jb'ughl Jor us.16and tvith us we coidd never have been masters of theseforts. It was God in fire that assisted us, and thatfought against the Jews, for it was not an undertakingto be compassed with hands or machines.This was, in fine the issue of the siege; And whenthe soldiers had neither rapine nor blood shed for theirspleens to work upon, ( as they would not have beenidle, if they had matter, 'i itus ordered them to laythe city and temple level with the ground; and tohave nothing standing, but the three famous turrets,Thasael, Hippicos, and Marriamne, that overtopedall the rest; and a piece of wall to the west-ward ofthe town, where he designed a garrison. The towersto remain as so many monuments to posterity of theRoman’s power and conduct in taking of them. Thisorder was punctually executed, and all the rest laid !so flat, that the place looked as if it never had beeninhabited. This was the end of the Jerusalem faction; ja mad and seditious people: And was also the end ofthe most glorious city of the universe.What is here chiefly remarkable in this; that noforeign nation ever came thus to destroy the Jews atany of their solemn festivals, from the days of Mosestill, this time, but came now upon their apostacy fromGod, and from disobedience of him. Nor is it pos¬sible, in the nature of things, that in any other nation,such vast numbers should be gotten together, andperish in this siege of any one city whatsoever, as nowhappened in Jerusalem.Thus was Jerusalem taken and utterly destroyed,in the second year of Vespasion, and on the eight day |of the month Gorpieus, having been five times takenbefore; i. o. by Abchseus king of Egypt, AntiochusEpiphanes, king of Syria; Pompy, and Herod, withSosius; who did all preserve the city after it wastaken. But Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon,laid it waste one thousand three hundred and sixtyi year?, eight months and six days after the building^ of it.The first founder of it was a Canaantish prince cal-11 led Melchizedeck, which in the Hebrew languageI signifies a just king; for such as he in aa eminentII manner. He first dedicated the city to God; erec-(.1 ted a tempie in it, and officiated in the quality of aI priest, giving it one name of Jerusalem, which beforeM was called Solyma.! When David the king of the Jews came afterwardsII to drive out the Ganaanites, he planted his own people,|l there : And in four hundred and seventy seven yearsi and three months after this, it was laid waste by theIf Babylonians.From the reign ef David there, to the destructionj of the city by Titus, it was one thousand one hundredr! seventy nine years; and two thousand one hundredIf and seventy seven from the foundation of it. Buta neither the antiquity, wealth, fame, nor the honourj of the religion itself, was any security against the ap-|| pointments of fate, and them which afterwards saw iti'j could not believe that ever there had been such a cityI there, yet the dispised Jews begged leave to build| part of the city, but after sixty five years, when theyI began to revolt. Then Elius Adrianus the Emperori slew many thousands of them: And wlmn his furywas over, he took one part of the city withoqt thej wall mount Calvery and Christ’s sepulchre, and madea spacious city, which he called after his own name,I Amelia Capitolia, which was inhabited by all nations,but most by Christians for five hundred years, andin six hundred and thirty nine, it was taken by theEgyptians and Saracens, who held it four hundredyears; and in one thousand and thirty nine, it wasregained by Godfrey Bollogn, who being electedking, refused to be crowned with a crown of goldwhere Christ was crowned with a crown of thorns:13It continued to idm and his successors eighty eightyears, till in 1127, it was taken by Saladine, king ofRgypt; -nd in one thousand five hundred and seven¬teen the Turks took it ( who are still masters of it)and called it in their own language Gunembreroa,the holy of holies.*The LIFE of Sr PETER the Apostle who was cru¬cified at Rome with his head downwards.His festival is celebrated by the Church, June 20.ST Peter was bora at Bethsaida, a place that hadthe honour of our Saviour’s presence, who resid¬ing usually in these parts, did often resort thither. H*is generally thought to be but ten years older than hisMaster, which his married condition, and the respectshewed him by the rest of the apostles, for his gravityof person, with other circumstances, seem to confirm.Being circumcised according to the law, his nayie thengiven him was Simon, to which our blessed Lord ad¬ded that of Cephas, signifying a stone, or rock, whichi* Peter Jn English. He was brother to St Andrewthe apostle, who first brought him to the knowledgeof the gosple. The father was Jonah of Bethsaida,probably a fisherman, who had the honour as well asZebedee, to have each of them two of their sons amongcur Saviour’s Apostles, though but twelve in number.Peter,was employed in fishing in the sea of Galilee,being one hundred furlongs in length, and forty inbreadth, the water clear and sweet, and stored withseveral kinds of choice fish.And here let us admire at the wonderful methodsef Divine Providence, that low and mean men shouldbe armed with such Divine Power, as to ruin thekingdom of Satan. The vile apostate Julian objectedagainst the prophets of the Old Testament, that they19were a company of rude illiterate men; but Ve furdthat these unlearned men and innocent apostles, bythe assistance of the Almighty, suddenly and power-1 ally prevailed over the learned world. Our Saviourdesigning to elect some peculiar persons to propegatehis gospel through all nations, made choice of twelveto be his apostles, and Simon Peter is by the Evan- •gelists put in front of them.It may be enquired when, and by whom the apos¬tles were baptized; Nicephorus relates. That ot alltne apostles, Christ baptized none but Peter with hisown hands, and Peter baptized Andrew, and the twosons of Zebedee, and the rest of the'apostles. Amongthe twelve, our Saviour choiced three, who seem to b«his Bear intimate companions, and whom he let intothe most secret passages and transactions of his life,uamely Peter, James and Johnf they being with bin*at the rising of Jarius daughter, as also at his trans-liguration on the mount, where Peter desired ourLord, that he might build three tabernacles in memoryof that great transaction; One author writes, that i*pursuance of his petition, there were afterwards threechurches built upon the top of this mountain ; and onewriter reports, that in his time, they shewed the ruinsof these three tabernacles, which were built accordingto St Peter’s desire.After our Lord had entered Jerusalem in triumph,he retired to Bethany, and dispatched Peter and Johato make a preparation for the passover; accordinglythey found the person whom he had described to thermand followed him to his house, which whether it wasSt John the Evangelist’s, situate near Mount Sion, orSimon the leper, or Nicodemus, or Joseph of Arima-thea is uncertain. These two, with St James, accom-paqied him to the garden in his agony; and Eusebiuswrites, that even at this time, Christians were wont.to come hither solemnly to offer up their prayers t«20God, and Ch|^t Jesus. Our Lord being ascended intoheaven and having fulfilled his promise of sending theHoly Ghost, the apostles-*and deciples continued awhile at Jerusalem, being tossed about with gentlestorms, but upon accasien of the martyrdom of St.Stephen, a violent persecution fell upon them, whichdispersed them into several countries; about the endof the reign of Caligula, the barbarous Roman Emp¬eror ; Peter having visited the churches, returned toJerusalem, and Herod Agrippa, grandson to Herodthe Great, having attained the kingdom of Judea, he,to ingratiate himself with the people, put St. Jamesto death, and finding this grateful to the vulgar, ap¬prehended St. Peter; and sent him to prison, placingstrong guards to secure him, but the angels of theLord delivered him in the night before his enemiesdesigned to execute him ; but before this, he is saidto have gone down to Antioch, and to have plantedthe Christian faith, and founded a church there, asEusebius and others record.After this he went to Rome, about the second yearof the emperor Claudius, and being mindful of thechurches which he had gathered in Pontus, Galatia,Cappadociai Bithynia an Asia the less, writ his firstepistle to them, and then took care to propagate theChristian faith, in the western parts of the world afterhe had continued some years at Rome, the Jews rais¬ing seditious tumults in the city, they were banishedfrom thence ; among whom w-as St. Peter, who fromthence returned back to Jerusalem, and was present atthe great apostoical synod, where the controversy a-bout Mosaical rites was determined, some report, thathe was in Briiain, and converted many to Christiani¬ty : but toward the end of Nero’s reign, he returnedto Rome, where he found the peoples minds hardenedagainst embracing the Christian religion, by the sub¬tilities and magic arts of Simon Magus; this impostor21resided in Samaria, where St. Peter the decon preach¬ed with much success confirming the same by mira¬cles ; however, Simon was in great reputation amongthe people, and stiled himself, the great power of God,and affirming that he was the supreme Deity, worship¬ped by all nations; the apostles sent Peter and Johnfrom Jerusalem to Philip’s assistance, who when theycame thither, laid their hands upon the new convertswhereupon they presently received the Holy Ghost;which when Simon saw, he offered them money ifthey would confer that power upon him. But Peterperceiving his vile intentions, scornfully rejected hisimpious offer. However, by his witchcrafts and sor¬ceries, he at length became acceptable to the em¬peror as well as the vulgar; Nero that monster, hadmuch veneration for him, being patron of the magi¬cians, and all those who have commerce with the in¬fernal powers, and Peter being returned to Rome,resolved to encounter him, and discover the impos¬tures and delusions of this wretched man.About that time, an eminent young gentleman,kinsmah to the emperor, died at Rome, and the sameof Peter’s having power to raise the dead, his friendswere persuaded to send for him, but others proposedSimon Magus, who readily came, being glad of theoccasion to magnify himself among the people, andPeter being present, Simon alledged, that he had pro¬voked the great povoer of God, and should lose his lifeif he did not raise the dead person, but if Peter pre¬vailed he himself would submit to the same fate :Peter accepted the terms, and Simon began hischarms and enchantments, whereat the dead gentle¬man seemed to move his head, upon which the peopleshouted, and cried he was alive, and talked to Simon,and began to insult Peter; the apostle intreated theirpatience, and told them it was nothing but fancy andappearance, and that if Simon were removed from/22the bod-side this delusion would soon vanish; whichdone, the body remained without the least sign ofmotion. Peter standing by at a good distance fromthe bed, silently made his address to heaven, and thenbefore them all command the young man in thename of the Ldid Jesus to arise, which he did imme¬diately, and spoke, walked, and eat, and was by Peterrestored to his mother. The people hereupon alter¬ed their opinions,' and fell upon Simon, with in¬tent to-have stoned him: but Peter begged bis lifeand told them, it would be punishment enough forhim, to see that in despite of his malice the kingdomof Christ should increase and flourish.The magician was inwardly tormented with thisdefeat, and vexed to see the triumph of the apostle,and mustered up all his infernal powers, acquaintingthe people, that he was offended at the Galileans, ashe called the Christians, and therefore set a day whenthey should see him fly up to heaven, and according1}'he went up to the top" of the Capital, and throwinghimself'- from thence, began his flight, which thespectators beheld with wonder and veneration, affirm^ing that this must be from the power of God, andpot of man: Peter standing in the crowd, prayed toGod, that the people might be undeceived, and thatthe vanity of the imposter might be discovered tothe confusion of him, and shame of his admirers;immediatley the w-ings which he had made himselfbegan to fail, so that he fell to the ground miserablybruised with the fall, and being carried to a neigh¬bouring village, and died soon after. The end of thiswretched man coming to the emperor’s ear: hast¬ened St. Peter’s death. Nero, no doubt, had beenformerly displeased with him on account of his Christi¬anity, and that he so strictly preached up temperanceand charity, thereby reclaiming so many women inRome, for a desolate and vicious live, which was4#h S3so disagreeable to his wanton lascivious temper, towhich he was a slave, and being by this means robbed■ of his dear companion, he resolved upon revenge,,i causing St. Peter as also St. Paul, who was at thatI time at Rome) to be cast into the Martime prison,I where they employed their time in preaching to theI prisoners, and those who visited them. And here itpj supposed, St. Peter wtote his second epistle tothedis-| persed Jews to confirm them iu the faith, and fortifyI them against those pernicious principles and practi-i ees, which even then began to break in upon theII Christian church.Nero returnin tcfroin Achaia, and entering Romewith triumph, re ed St. Peter should fall a sacrifice! to his crueltv. Wile the fatal stroke was daily ex-: pected, the Christi ns at Rome earnestly solicited him; to make his escape, and reserve himself for fartherI service to the church ; which at length prevailedI with him, and the next night having prayed with,ami taken leave of his brethren, it is related, that| he got over the prison wall, and being come to the1 city gate, he is there said to have met with our Lord,who was just entering the city; Peter, it is said, ask-! ed him, Lord whither art thou going? from whom1 he presentlyvreceived this answer, I am coming to| Rome to be crucified the second time; by which! reply, Peter apprehended himself to be reproved,| and that our Lord meant it for his death, and that| he was to be crucified in his servant; and so w'entback to the prison, and surrendered himself to the1 keeper being ready to acquiesce in the w ill of God. {Before his suffering he was scoui ged after theRoman manner, who used to whip capital offendersbefore they suffered. Having saluted his brethren, andtaken his leave of St. Paul, his fellow prisoner,he wus led up to the top of the Vatican mount, be¬ing sentenced to be crucified, the most painful andI24,shameful of all deaths: he then entreated the officersthat he might be crucified the ordinary way, butsuffer with his head downward, and his feet up to hea¬ven, as being unworthy to die in the same posture 'ashis blessed Master, his body being taken down, wassaid to have been embalmed by Marcellinus the.presbyter after the Jewish way, and then buried inthe Vatican, where it lay obscurely until the reign ofConstantine the great, who had so much reverencefor this apostle, that he built a church in the Vaticanto his memory, which is now one of the mosc famouscathedrals in the word. This account of his death,tho’ not mentioned in the holy writ, is recorded bythe ancient Ecclesiastical Historians, but with whatcertainly it is, we must leave the reader to judge.IAdam sinn’d and Adam fell,Then Adam’s doom was death and hell !Yet by our Lord on bloody Cross,Repaird s the fall, prevents the curse;To all who look with Peter's faith,And meekly follows him to death ;Who even at last with humbly sp'rit,Revers'd his head, turn'd up his feet;Which shew'd his great humility.He was unworthy, to suffer as He.FINIS.

Four Songs..oThe Star of the East.Ihe Clowns Courtship.I T he Fair Maiden. j■mAND /I O Poortith Cauld.KILMARNOCK:Pnniod for the IkUteilertioTBE STAR OF THE EAST.OF late you have heard of two loversThat lived near yon castle so high;To the green woods they ofttimes resorted,While the owl from the forest did cry.When he gaz’d on the blooming young creaturiler beauteous enchanting eyes,peed her heart it was captur’done that soon did her despise.They ranged the woods with great pleasure ;Their weary limbs oft did repose ;A large spreading oak was th nr covert,’I'vvas there they their hearts did disclose.He told her, her worth was so precious.That he never could he deceive,Enraptur’d with love she exclaimed.If you do, my death on you I’ll leave.The rays of her pleasure shone brighterThan the beems from the sun from on high,But a dark dismal cloud sopn appeared,Proclaiming her ruin was nigh.A breaze from#the ocean of falsehood,Did poison her pleasure with woe,Till the heart of this young blooming creatureWith sorrow was made for to flow,3Unmov’d with the groans that she utter’d,He wantonly to her did siy,For marriage l am not'disposed,Then homeward he set on his way.She cried, * Remember your promise, 'For you know that to you I’m witli child.’Aspiring for one that was greater,i .The Star of the East he beguil’d.Distracted she ran thro’ the woodlands,Her bosom still heaving with'pain ;No answer was made to her sighing,Bur me rocks that re-echoed again.Soon death’s icy drops hang suspended,On lim brow of this beauty betray’d,To those boisterous waves she’s now bendedIn death’s robes she now is array’d.When I visit the tomb of this lassie,Some spirit it whispers to me,‘ A Victim to love lies here buried.Where youth bloom’d in every eye,’No more by yon castle she wanders,To love she is no more a slave.Bereaved of all earthly comforts.She mouldering now lies in the grave.THE CLOWN’S COURTSHIP.THERE once liv’d a clown in a steed.He thought that he would hae a wiSeTo help in his meal and his bread,For his siller it wasnae sae rifie.4laird in the next borough townHad siller and daughters fu’ plenty.Say* b«, if the rest be nae flown,Rejoice, for my chance it is dainty.He’s put on his braw plaiden trews,He scrap’t'affhis beard wi’ a whittle,He’s put on the best o’ his blues,And his bonnet he rubbed fu’ muckle.He’s ta’en up the wide stable caim,To gie his bit head a bit clautie,He’s maist torn thy hyde frae rhe bane.For, O it was wondrous tautie.He’s put his head-piece aboon a’,Look’d cheeks in a cogie o’ water;Says he, I am bonnie an’ braw.And I’m sure wi’ the lass an’ the tocher.Wi’ a stick fathorti lang in his ban’.Right cocked, I’m sure it wad bruise ye ;An’ aye as he lilted an’ san^,I’m sure, sure she will never refuse me.He went to the gentleman’s door,Not knowing the fashions o’ gentry.He lean’d his weight on the door,And he fell wi’ a blawd in the entfy.Miss Jeanie an’ servants came downTo wonder an’ gaze upon Johnny,He fixed his eyes on Miss Jean,Because she was wondrous bonnie.Miss Jean, to keep up the joke,She oxter’d him into her chamber;And aye as he rifted an’ spoke,He swore that she shined like amber.' -kJMiss Jeanie, my errand’s tu ynn,To make you a sort 0’ hall marrow,To wait on my housie, *ny dow,When Tm out at the plough an* the harrow.Ye’ll get p irritch an’ m’lk to your hreakiast.And butter an’ cheese to your inner,The same at e?en to your corning ;And ye’ll swattle like auld lucky kimmer.I’ve thretty pund scots ev’ry year,Twa pecks o’ gude meal, and a sixpence.Sent down every Saturday, cleai,Brought me down frae auld Andrew Dixon.I have likewise a good milk cow,And things will keep us-aye breathing,T.i i good fat pigs, and a sow.And they get a’ their grazing for naething.I have likewise a good buffet stool,A foot gang, .a bed, and an aumry,A bink for ha tiing nur bowls,And I break thenj right aft when I’m angry.I have likewise twa good horn spoons,A flesh-fork, a pat and a ladle,A girdle for hardening our scones,A poker, tangs, and a pettle.So tell me if ye’re coming hame.And dinna appeal in a swither,I or if you don’t tak nit1', my dame,I’m just gaun awa’ till anifher.Miss Jeanie reply’d with a smile,I cannot accept of your offer.Some higher than you must beguileMy father, or he parts with'his tocher.6Fur if I was to give my eonsent.It would be at my father’s displeasure.So Johnny, you must just be content*To lose such a beautilul treasure.Her father, he was at the door.Came ben with ah angry complexio*,And aye as he cursed, he sworeHe would crush ’em, and grieve ’em, and vex ’em .sa any he'rrais't coupt the creels,’He ran wi’ shy speed in a hurry,They humed the dogs at his heels,On purpose the clown for to worry.THE FAIR MAIDEN.A S I stray’d along the banks of Irvine’s sweet^ * river.O there I descry’d a fair maiden alone ;Her looks seem’d wild, she exclaim’d, Shall IneverAgain see my W illie, O no he is gone.Cold, cold r.ow he lies, I have left my true lover-.For now the green turf his body doth cover;And angels of bliss his grave shall watch over,And protect the remains of him now no more.O war, cruel war, what hopes hast thou blasted ?Wilt thou ne’er have an end, and sweet peacecome again ?Shall Britain, blest Island, by thee be exhausted, 1And her brave hardy sons strew the cold crim-'son’d plain ?nHark! the-bugi^ it sounds; see the'warriors ad¬vancing,Impatient to fight. See the steel shows itsglancing,And our Graham, gallant Graham, to his famenow enhancing,For the victory he gain’d o’er the foes of our Isle.Now, now I must wander, forlorn and forsaken,Through life’s stormy vale, without friends meto aid. *The thrush may well sing, and lark that’s awaking,But their songs give no pleasure nor charmsto a maid.. . . 'jL ~ [ 1 ‘ * fT fFor my Willie is gone, he is left me for ever.Be witness, ye fields, and ye sweet winding river,Was I ever unfaithful ? O no, I was never;I was. kind, for I lov’d him ; but now he’s no amore.Thus spake the fair stranger, so sad and distress’d,As she sat on the swaird, with her eyes fSt-ldon high**’ And oft with herdiands on her bosom she press’d,It was there, in her bosom, her sc-row* tlio lie.I As 1 list’ned my heart with compassion wasmoved.To hear her complaining for him whom sheloved.1 O then I departed, and homeward I roved,In sad tears for the stranger, and him-now nomore.8O POORTITH CAuSLD.T>tt*O Poortith: cauld, and restless love.Ye wreck my peace between ye ;Yet ponritth a’ could I forgive,An’ ’twere na for my Jeanie.O why should fate sic pleasure have,LoveVclearest bands untwining ?Or why sae sweet a flower as love.Depend on Fortune’s srhiling ?* Thfc warid’s wealth when I think on,It’s pride and a’ the lave o’t,l‘ie, fie, on sillv coward man,\V,That he should be the slave o’t.'

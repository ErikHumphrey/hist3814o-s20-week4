for having onceiismelt to the spit, they always icve a|goodjoint: Those you must entertain with someunerry discourse and lay aside whining orosolemn protestations; kiss them till their! iears crack, and when you find a convenient! time and place, warm them with caresses,p squeezing their hand, gently treading onntheir toes; and when you kiss, bear closeto them, and you will soon perceive, bytheir eager looks, blushing, and their oftenchanging of colour, that now is the time "to ask a favour, to which you will havea faint denial, if any at all, and then makeuse of your time and press forward without 'delays, for they are dangerous ;

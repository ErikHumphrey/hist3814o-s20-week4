W'eel, ye see,it sae hg/ppenit, that Habbie, like monie mae nooa days was gayan fond o’ a weedrap o’ the blue, andas the Storie gangs, sae \fashis vyife; sae itafj^n hap¬pened, when Habbie yokit the fuddle, Janet yokitit tae. Noo it’s an auld Scotch saying and a trueane, thajfe when a cannel’s lichted at baith ends, its’une bu'ns dune—an’ it was sae verified in the pre¬sent caise, for Habbie waukening ae morning after . ja beavig fuddle, says to Janet, “ Kise, wuman, andseb -if^ye can getSne hauf a gill; for oh ! ma heidis jist likin to split.” Hauf a gill! ” quo’ Janet,“ whaav wud 1 get it, when there’s no a plack ina’ the Lyivse ; 'and as for takin’ k On, ye ken,that’sclean out o' the quastion ; sae ye maun jist lie stilland-thole the best way ye can.” “Oh!

So up ge$sJanet, and awa to the Laird’s house; when rappingthe knocker, the door was opened by the leddie,J3wha seeing Janet sae pitifu* Inkin’, she saysr“ Keepus a’ the day. are thaire onie thing wrang at kame,that ye hae come here sae sune in the morping f ’“ Wrang!” quo’ Janet, (dichtin’ her een wi’ thetail o’ her apron,) “a’s wrang the gither, my leddie;is na oor Habbie deid ? ’ “ Habbie deid !” quo’the lady in surprise. “ A weel a wat, is he,’^ qiio’Janet, “ an a sair trial it is to me, leddie, for thaireno as muckle in the house this morning as wowdfeid a sparrow; an’ vvhaur to get onything, I’m sure1 dinna ken.

In the meantime,hame gangs the Laird, whan the first thing heheard, was, that Habbie Simpson was deid. ** Na‘na,” quo’ he, “its no Habbie; its only Janet.”‘ its Habbie ’ quo’ the Leddie “wasna Janet heirthis morning hersel’. and telt me ?—and didna sheget awa some speerits and bakes, as she saidthere was naething in the house And didna Imeet Habbie, jist as I was cornin’ hame, when hetelt me Janet was deid.

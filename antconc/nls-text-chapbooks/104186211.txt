If you play among strangersbeware of him that seems simple or drunken, forUnder their habit the most spacious cozeners arepresented, and while you think by their simpli¬city and imperfections to beguile them, and there¬by perchance are persuaded by their confederates,which you take to be your friends, you will thenbe most of all deceived. Beware also of the bet¬ters and lookers on. and particularly of them thatbet on your side, whilst they look en your game,withqyt suspicion, they discover it by sings to9'your •adversaries, with whom they bet, and yetare their confederates.Bat in showing feats and juggling with cards,(the principal point consisteth in the shufflingi them nimbly, and always keeping one card eitherI at the bottom cr in some known place of thestock, four or five cards from it; hereby you shallI seem to work wonders, for it will be easy for you: to see one card, which though you be percet'’ed: to do, it will not be suspected, if you shuffleI them well afterwards : and this note I must gi, o( you, thtit in reserving the bottom card, you must5 always, whilst you shuffle, keep him a little be-i fore or a little behind all the cards lying under-i neath him, bestowing him, I say, either a littlei beyond his fellows before, right over the fore-1 finger, or else behind the rest, so as the littlefinger of the left hand may meet with it, whichI is the easier, the readier, and better way in tho| beginning of your shuffling. Shuffle m thick asi you can, and in the snd throw upon the stocici the neither card, with so many more at the least: as you would have preserved for any purpose, aI little before or a little behind the rest, provided; always that your fore-finger (if the pack lay b6-! hind,) creep up to meet with the bottom card,: and when you feel it, you may then held it uu-I til you have shuffled over the cards again, stillI leaving your kept card below. Being perfect| herein, you may d.o almost what you list withi cards by this means, what pack soever you use,! though it consisteth of eight, twelve, or twentyi cards, you may keep them still together imserveii next to the card, and yet shuffle them often tot satisfy the curious beholder. As for example,< and for brevity sake, te show divers*"feats under> one.10To tell without confederacy what Card he think-• cth on.Lay three c^.rHs at a little distance, and bid astander-by be true and not waver, but think onone of the three, and by his eye you shall assur¬edly perceive which he thinketh; and you shall, do the like if you cast down a whole pack of cardswith the faces upwards, whereof there will befew or none plainly perceived, and they also courtcards: but as you cast them down suddenly, somust you take them up presently marking bothhis eyes, and the card whereon he looketh.How to make a Card jump out of the Pack, andrun on the Table.This is a wonderful fancy if it be well handled:as thus:Take a*pack of cards and let any one draw anycard that they fancy best, and afterwards takeand put it into the pack, but so as you knowwhere to find it at pleasure: for by this time, lsuppose you know how to shuffle the cards, andwhere to find any card when it is put into thepack; then take a piece of wax and put it underthe thumb-nail of your hand, and there fasten ahair to your thumb, and the other end of thehair to the card, then spread the pack ef cardsopen on the table, then say, “If you are a purevirgin that card will jump out of the pack,” thenby your words or charms seem to make it jumpon the table.11iHovo to tell Tnhat Card any man thinlitth on, andhow to convey the same into a kernel oj a nutor cherry stone, and the same again it to one'spocket; and hctso to make him draw the same,or any card you please, and all under ofiedevice.Take a nut, or cherry stone, and bum a hole! through the side of the top of the shell, and also,[through the kernel, if you will, with a hot bodkin,tor bore it with an awl, and with a needle pull(out the kernel, eo as the same may be as,wide as’ the hole of tue shell; then write the name of the;card on a piece of fine paper, and roll it up hard,then put it into the nut of cherry-stone, and stop; the hole up with wax, and rub the same over withi a little dust, and it will not be perceived; theni let some stander-by dnw a card, saying, ‘ It isi no matter what card you draw,’ and if your handsi so serve you to use the card well you shall profferI him, and he shall receive the same card that youI have rolled up in the nut; then take another nuti and fill it up wi h ink, and then stop the hole^ up with wax, and then give that nut which is fiU[ led with ink to somebody to crack, and when hefinds the ink come out of his mouth, it will c ausegreat laughter.

THELIFE AND DEATHOFR A B H A.THE GLASGOW GLUTTON,WITHAN ELEGYWRITTEN BYWilliam Cameron,( Alias “ Haxvkie” )GLASGOW,Printed by J. Muir, 49, Trongate Straet.ANDDEATH OF RAB HA’.1.cm the Glasgow Herald, Nov, 23, 1843We understand that Robert Hall was founddead on Wednesday last, in a hay-loft inThistle Street, Hutchesontown, belongingto Mr Whitelaw, who for some time past haskindly permitted the vagrant to shelter him¬self there from the inclemencies of the sea¬son. Rab is only deserving of notice in sofar as he was known for his eccentric habits,and his vast animal or gastronomic powers,to almost every individual in the West ofScotland. Although originally, we believe,3a farm servant or agricultural labourer,, Rabspeedily abar cloned settled ejnployment forthe idle roystering life cf a vagrant, and be¬came one of the most perfect specimens ofthe big beggarman which Scotland couldproduce Powerful in frame, and of un¬bounded *apacity of sto rsch, Rab wander-cdover ail the west country, and was rarelyabsent from horse-race, b x-hunt, cr cours¬ing, for which he had a natura taste ; buthe delighted in these meetings more fromthe unlimited quantities off meat and drinkwhich were supplied to him occasionally bythose who knov? his failing or ru ingpafsio.oand were anx ous to see how dutch the mancould devour. Nothing pleased Rab morethan when any party foolishly took up a beton Ins eatii g qualities, ami it is sa d thattho;e woo sraked their money ou his powerswereraicly the losers. Glasgow 'was gene*raliy his heac’-quatters, and so lo^g as he hsdthe iibeity of throwing his ii/nbs to zest inany stab e or straw house, his utmost ambi¬tion as 10 lodgings was satisfied. Rub wasa great admirer* of the pngiltatic art, but hhad no great notion tor Ugutirg MVnseif; an <beyond the appetite to gratify desires littleabove those of the brute,’Ve apc not aware4that the man had much ill in him. His deathwas in keeping with such a life, for havingtumbled into his lair in a state of intoxica¬tion, there is little doubt that he was smo.thered amongst the straw.llab was known by almost every personin the st of Scotland for his eccentricity ofmanners and appearance he being generallyclothed in rags, made up of three, and some¬times four, pair ot trousers, with as manyjackets. It is stated that vartoi s wpgeiswere won by various noblemen and gentle¬men by Ha’s voracious appetite, and he wasa great favourite amongst them, frequentlygetting his victuals at their houses( n one occasion, liab being on a trip toRothsay, upon his return home, two gentle jmen undertook a wager that Hab wouldeat seven pom d of ship biscuit! liab nosooner heard of this treat than he com¬menced work, but the biscuit proving tnohard for his jaws, he was obliged to give ovt rlafter having eaten aboutfourpound of them;however, thj gentleman belt ng upon theappetite of Uab knew the bottom ot his sto¬mach better than to lose his money in thatway. Rab being a little chagrined at ht&5/3defeat with the biscuit, said, that if the gen-lemen were agreeable to double the bets, liewould sup a peck of oatmeal made intub'ose After asking him if he was full witheating the biscuit? he said he was not,but only he felt his jaws sore with crackingit, beset to work with the brose, aud tin*idled 'hem in admirable style, leaving noth¬ing but the empty cog. We think, uponthe whole, that this feed was pretty consider¬ableUn another occasion,while lounging aboutthe Broomielaw, he went into a house tor adrink or water ; as the woman happened tohave none in the house at the time, she re¬quested Ran to take a seat till she would re-um with some from a neighbouring well.During her absence, Bab was busily* en¬gaged in demolishing a stone of potatoeswhich the poor woman had made readyor herself and family and on being ques¬tioned by the woman, he said he was verydry and he thought the potatoes wouldquench his urouth.Shortly afterwards, being about Hawk-head House, where there was a party of gen¬tlemen wishing a little amusement, theythought fit to t»y Rab with another gorge ^6L— K , wl.o was present, acquainteti Hab that he hatl taken up a bet withanother gentleman that he would eat a Calf;Without acquainting him in what manner ifwas to be cooked, Rab said he would doihis endeavour. K  having orderedthe calf to be baked up in pies, after theywe* e ready, he said to Ra'> that he mightpartake of a pie till the calf would be ready.One pie came in after another, till he had.devoured the whole calf with the exceptionof one pie. He was then told him to eatthat one also, when Rab bawled out, '• K—,Lo’d I eanna dae that, ye ken, the calf’s to;come yet ”If ws v' ere to insert all the anecdotes con¬cerning this ecc.ntric character they would<i 1 a volume, we must therefore, commencethe melancholy part of our story :—On Mar-.tinmas Wednesday, iNcvember <22, a numberof Rab’s acquaintances from the countrygave him several dozes ol meat and drink,in which lie inunlgad rather freely. Latein the evening he was seen making his wayalong Stockvvel) Street bridge,towards Hut-chisontown, in a state of inebriety, wherehe found shelter in the hay loft alluded to,and carried to the Police Office, there, to a.7/3w.iit farther investigation. It is supposedthat lie died partly by the drink he bad swal¬lowed, and partly by suffocation 1 husended the career of poor Kab. He died ashe lived, in the midst of gluttony ana in¬temperance; and we can only lament thatthe man should have ever given himself upto such sensual appetites.—■The following is an Elegy, written by W.Cameron, (alias Hawkie) on the occasion.ELEGY.Ye Glasgow folks, baith ane ar* a’,Look sad, and let ateardoonFor your big glutton, Rabbie Ha’,Is noo no more;His soul's winged from a stable-VtTo anither shore.Rab, by profession, foolery feign'd.For that the wretch eou'd not be blam’d,Rab’s character a glutton claim’d,Beef, scone, or bannock :A calf devouring a’ at ance.Ne'er turn’d his stamack.sYe was fern swell0, baith ane and a’.Lord Kel—n noo come 'frae your ha'.In mournfu’ weeds lamerU the ca’Took puir Rab hanae ;The epicures may hide their headWhen they hear his name.Ae simmer morning, ere the suni he aught hour clock had scarcely rung,1 he Bripgate bakers they’ve aft sungRab's glorious taster,£ax pints o’ milk and ninety sconesWas kis digester.Ye wights i* the ither side o’ Styx,Charon on that river claims his rights,And so will Rab wi* a’ his might,Baith drunk an’ sober ;He’ll toom your pantries day and night,Frae Sept’mber t’ October.Ye fairies, kelpies, ane an' a‘,Ye msister deils, baith great an* sma’.Be sure and watch oor Rabbie Ha’,And guide him weel,Or else your bannocks he’ll mak’ srna’,And pinch your meal.

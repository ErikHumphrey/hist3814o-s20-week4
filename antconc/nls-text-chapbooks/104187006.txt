This American inheritance was notcomprehended under the aforefaid laft fettlcmentof the entailed eftates of Kilbucho and Whirfladcin my favour, publifhed by my brother in O6I0-ber 1767, and therefore Lord Hyndford and LordProvoft, and their univerfal fattor and agent,in virtue of their falfe 'will, had a better title tothat eftate than any other eftate whatever of mydeceafed brother ; but the truth is now confeffed,that their right to the fucceflion, in all or any ofthefe eftates here, or in America, was foundedin theft, peijury, and forgery, and high trea-fon, more infamous if pofiible than that of thecontinental congrefs, who lately invaded that in¬heritance vi et armis.And that is not all ; for, upon the 2d of Maytyyr, the Lord Chief Baron direfted me to fwearto the total falfehood of the will in the preroga¬tive court, and by that oath alone, the convey¬ance his Lordfliip acquired from me of the A-merican inheritance is, to this hour, fupported,and nothing lefs than abfolute infatuation couldmove his Lordflnp to feduce the executors, as theyC 17 ]f»y, to felf-evident perjury in emitting a contra- jry oath in the fame court.ttty The Right Honourable Judge and Reve¬rend Jury arc, by the mandamus, required now to 'proceed to hear and determine, whether 1, DavidDickfon, am really the identical minifter of New-lands, and the neareft and lawful heir of provifion,intended by my brother, and called to the fuccef-lion in that character by my brother’s aforefaidkft fett'ement of the eifates of Kilbucho andWhitflade, publiilicd by himfelf in OQober 1767;and for determining that queftion, I {hall appealto the evidence of the fettlement itfelf, whenMr Loch is permitted by his fuborners to pro¬duce it to the other reverend gentlemen of thejury, as.he has already produced it to Mr Web-iler, and, at the fame time, Mr Loch will con-defeend to produce another fettlement of that e-flate impofed upon my brother, and faid to havebeen executed by him in favour of another mi- " |nillcr of Newlands, whenever exifted ; and theonly other evidence that feems neceflary to in-ffru& this article of the brieve, is a decreet ofrcdu&ion, improbation, and declarator of forge¬ry, pronounced by the Court of Selfion, of all thefentences of my deprivation, fufpenfion, or depo-fition from the office and benefice of the minifterof Newlands, which final and irrevcrfible decreetwas pronounced at the fuit of the Lord Chief Ba¬ron himfelf, then Lord Advocate, fupported bythe Honourable Dean of Faculty, then Sovereignof the bar, and that decreet, fo far as refpedts thedeclarator of forgery, was ratified once and againby the Court, upon the written teftimony of thereverend Meffieurs and Doctors Alexander Web-C 18 ]fter, Daniel Macqueen, John Dryfdale, RobertDick, and Henry Lundie, judicially produced inthe Court of Seflion, to which they will certain¬ly adhere, in their etidence to be emitted beforethe other reverend brethren of the jury ; and thatit not all, for, upon a proper examination, thefcfive reverend gentlemen, cfpccially Mr Lundie,muft teflify, that all the fcnttnccs of deprivationpronounced againft me in the fpiritual court*,were founded upon malicious and confefl'ed for¬gery of warrants that never had any real exigence,and perjury, fupported by facrilegious alienationof the King’s charity by Lord Chief Baron, thenLord Advocate, and his confederate Dr Robert-fon, in the government of this miferablc church,in which 1 have done more at leaft than any otherperfon that ever lived, except the author of thewidow* fund, for relief of my diftrefTcd brethrenin the miniftry ; and by the grace of God, my heartand my life, under all the cataftrophes of this va¬rious (late of mortality, has been more agreeable tothe fpirit of Chriftianity, and laws of the church,than either Lord Chief Baron’s or Dr Robertfon’s,themfelves being ivitneffes •, and it appears fromthe records of the church, that all the twentyyears perfecution I have fufFcred, originatedfolely from my trefpafs in admitting Lord ChiefBaron into the the clafs of my elders, with LordElliock, and the late Duke of Argyle, who wereapproved, and his Lordfhip rejected in the year1757, by his own prefbytery of Peebles, as theirrecords, forged as they are, do teftify.'jmo, It now remains for the Right Honourablejudge and jury of this court, to enquire into “ the“ value of the eftates of my deceafed brother, c-“ fpccially r=-'-=« *’* 'T1t>- ;ni ni»i<t*ni .11'C 19 ]“ fpecially within your territory of the New-“ Town, and determine of what fuperior they“ are holden ^ by what tenor ?

and by what tenor they are holden ? But,as I am affured, as already faid, that thefe perju¬red thieves have fold all my brother’s eftate in theNew Town to the magiflrates and council, andtransferred the property upon the flolen warrantfrom me before mentioned, and as the reverendgentlemen of the jury, and the Lord Provoft him-feif, and Mr Loch, and Mr Buchan, their faflorand chamberlain, were parties to that tranfa£lion,it is therefore neceftary, that all thefe partiesftiould be examined in the exhibition.It is alfo proper to inform this court, that asLord Hyndford, Lord Provoft, and the other per¬jured executors transferred the pofieffion of all mybrother’s real and perfonal eftates in cumulo, toMr Loch their univerfal fa£lor, without invento¬ry, without cautieji, and without confirmation,■which pofieflion he was unable to maintain, hetherefoteI 'OF SCOTIANC 20 ]therefore transferred thefe eftates, as lie receivedthem into the hands of the Court of Seffion, with¬out an inventory^ and pcrfuaded their Lordfhipsto accept of the furrendry, and to fequeftiate andforfeit all the uninventoried eftates,in treasonableviolation and defiance of the claim of right, notonly by purfuits founded upon frivolous and weakpretences, and lame and defective probation, asthat Magna Charta fpeaks, but without any pur-fuit at all, and without any form of procefs or pre¬tence whatever of law, reafon, or juifice, upon theevidence of a hjl •will and tejlament, and aninftrument of feilin and other writs, confefiediyfalfe, forged, and counterfeited, and theteftimonyof executors and other witnefies confefledly per¬jured.And that is not all,for their Lordfhips,in the year1771,committed the poffcfTion of theuninventoriedettetes to Mr Macdonald, an extractor and agentin their own court, declared incapable of the of¬fice of fa£tory, by an adl offedcrunt, and withoutan inventory, Mr Macdonald, the fa&or of thecourt, is authorifed to pay over all his intromif-fions to Lord Hyndford, Lord Provoft, and theother perjured executors, and their univerfal fac¬tor, who have, without an inventory, as I am in¬formed, diverted themfelves of their poftef-fion in Auguft 1775, by final inveftiturcs andfettlements of my eftates in my own favours, andin my own terms, as Lord Chief Baron affirms ;but all the fettlements I have feen directed by hisLordfhip, are founded upon the confefled theft,forgery, and perjury of the executors, and are ra¬dically eftablifhed upon the falfe will and tefta-, ment, which Lord Chief Baron himfelf, in thechara&er■'“'A• /''.AC *r ]character of a counfcllor of law, and arbitrator notfor me, but for the executors,has declared not on¬ly to be a falfe and improbative writ, but a tef-tament diametrically contrary to the true laji willand intention of the teifator, ascertained by theteftimony of this fame Lord Chief Baron himfelf,and therefore neither 1, nor any Succeeding heir,can inherit under that felonious title, without in¬curring the fame capital and infamous guilt withthe executors; and the truth is, that upon a juf-tice warrant of imprifomnent iflued agatnft LordHyndford and Mr Macdonald, he wifely renoun¬ced his factory, by an holograph paper-writing,bv him fubfcribed, and Lord Hvndford alfo re-nounced his executorfhip, and faved himfelffromprifon, by deforcement of four conilables in hisown kitchen, fo that I am by them tolerated inexufttng the rents of my own dlate of Kilbucho:But the Court of S:fiion are for ever difabled torefcind their own fer]ueitration and forfeiture,without confeffing the high treafon of impofing it.So that, upon the whole, the pofleffion of allthe uninventoried, opulent, and difincumbcredeftates, real and perfonal, in Scotland, England,and America, devolving to my property in right¬ful fucceflion by the death of my brother, mullbe reported to his Majefty by the verdi£l of thisright honourable and reverend court, as forfeitedeftates, feized and fequeftrated by the treafon-ablc defpotifm of the Court of Seffion, in avowedviolation and defiance of the moft efiential articlesof the Magna Ckarta of Scotland.DAVID DICKSON.AfterC 22 ]After this petition is fubfcrihed, I have thepleafure of being affured, that both Lord Hynd-lord, and Lord provolt Kincaid are determined ju¬dicially, in prd'ence of the reverend jury, to re¬nounce and difclaim any intereft of property, pof-fefiion, or adminiftration of my uninventoried e-Itates, upon the title of the falfe •willy or upon a-ny other title whatever; and that is not all, forthe Lord Provoft affirms, that he virtually revokedMr Loch’s factory many years ago, and that allthe paper-writings faid to be fubfcribed by himin the character of an executor, under the direc¬tion of my Lord Chief Baron, are abfolute forge¬ries that never exilted ; and he affirms particular¬ly, that he never emitted an executor’s office oathin the prbbate of the •will before the prerogativecourt, nor in any court whatever, fo that the willyto this hour, is, in the conftru£tion of law, fuch afelonious, improbativey paper-writing, that everyother executor publiffiing it, or ufing it in judge¬ment, without the probate oath of the Lord Pro¬voft, muft, upon that foie evidence, fuffer thepains of infamy and death at Tyburn, if not inthe Grafs-market, efpecially confidering, that up¬on exhibition of my brother’s true lafl fettlcmentin O&ober 1767, and Lord Chief Baron’s tefti-meny to the falfehood of the June will, emittedin his Lordfliip’s decreet-arbitral upon the nthof Auguft 1775, everyone of the other executorsmuft confefs their own perjury in the falfehoodof their probate oaths.To fay no more, it would be very grievous, andI hope unnecellary at prefent, to recite all the o-ther forgeries, thefts, and perjuries, obliterations,lacerations, and falffications, even of the recordsofju- j»: 1.  a-jx[ ]of the court of feflion and the houfe of peers, isc.<bc. be. that have been devifed and perpetratedwith impunity in this cafe, which may pofliblyfall under the review of his majefty and the pri¬vy council : but God forbid that I fhould formmy own judgement, or with the world to formtheir judgement of the general charadher of thegentlemen concerned, from this marvellous fpeci-men, more than the character of the devout Kingof Ifrael, from his murder and adultery in the cafeof Uriah and his wife.The trial of the cafe before this court is adjourn¬ed to the 15th of January, and, at the defire ofmany concerned, the fecond printed edition of theStatement before the king and council (hall be folong compaffionately fupprefied.Edinburgh, 3d Jan. 1777-To the Reverend Mr Webjler tie an of the ChapelRoyal, &c.My very Dear Sir,I have ferioully revifed every line of the pro¬ceeding petition, which is certainly the molt lin¬gular hiltory that ever occurred in this age orkingdom, and cannot be believed without demon-ftrativc evidence. It is difagreeable, but it isabfolutely neceflary, to require your teftimonyto prove that Lord Chief Baron, or his accompli¬ces, not by your inattention, but my own fimpli-city, found means to carry off a difpofition depo-fited in your hands, to my whole eftate, in favourof a tribe of perjured thieves, upon his Lordfliip’slolcmnfolemn promife of deftafance or retrocejjion, whichit appears never to have been intended by them.However, his Lordihip’s promife was frequent¬ly repeated, and I muft intreat you to tranfmitthis intimation to his Lordfhip of the necefiity,for his own honour and intereft, as well as ours,to infill for immediate performance. 1 am,Dear Sir,With entire and perpetualElteem and AlFe&ion,Yours,DAVID DICKSON.':—-- ■» -TV-

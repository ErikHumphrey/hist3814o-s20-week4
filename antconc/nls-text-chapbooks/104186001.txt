THESURPRISING LIFE AND ADVENTURESOV THBGENTLEMAN-ROBBERGENERALLY CALLED THECaptain General of the Irish Robbers,Protector of the rights and properties of hisBenefactors, and Redresser of the wrongsof the poor and distressed.His daring mood preserved him still ;This was the Robber’s simple plan,That they should take who have the will,And they alone should keep who can.WOEDSWOETH.GLASGOVPRINTED FOR THE BmmmwmmmKmwmm.THE HISTORY OPREDMOND O’HANLON.REDMOND O’HANLON was the son of a reput¬able gentleman, who had a considerable estate, andlived at the foot of Slygunnin mountains, in the coun¬ty of Armagh, among a vast number of relations,several whereof were of the same name. After hisparents had given him the best education the timeand place could afford, they obtained a small postfor him in the army, where he served a few yearswith credit, though very young, till the reduction ofthe Irish forces in that kingdom, among which ourRedmond was one.The nation being reduced by the English forces,several Irish families, who had a hand in the warsof Ireland, were dispossessed, and their lands for¬feited ; by which means a very great alteration wasmade in this family, and several of the O’Hanlonswere obliged to travel, in hopes of retrieving theirfortunes. But poor Redmond, in this unhappy con¬dition, once happened to be at the killing of a gen¬tleman in a quarrel, and flying for safety, stoppedabroad for a long time, still refusing to come to atrial till he was outlawed, which put him to hisshifts. But our hero having received instructionsin the art of war, and being naturally of an un¬daunted courage, was easily led into the secret ofinvading other men’s properties, both on the high¬way and by breaking open of houses, till he had ac¬quired as much money as might have put him in away to live above the frowns of fortune, with goodmanagement, all his life.But seeming to relish this new course of life morethan the former, he proceeded in his robberies, till; from an infancy in the art, he became one of theI most notorious and expert of that profession thatl] had ever been bred in the kingdom of Ireland. Hehad made himself acquainted with all the bye pas-i i sages in the country, and knew every lurking place1:1 in the mountains of Newry and Slygunnin, so that' i1 whoever pretended to pursue him made but fruitlessj attempts, and commonly returned with loss andi j shame, like dogs that lost their ears, both before and! I after the rewards were offered by the government|| for apprehending him.He was strong and active, and as occasion re-ji; quired, could perform his feats either on foot, or on31 horseback : and though ho was so notorious a plun-m derer, yet he was naturally of a very generous dis-®| position, frequently giving share of what he gotvj from the rich to relieve the poor in their necessities.:'J!j His remarkable actions and surprising attempts,K'l spread his character through all the country ; and<n being joined by a great number of his former ac-il quaintances ; (adventurous lads, who became his4 associates spontaneously,) till his company was aug-M mented to the number of fifty active men, mostlyi his own relations ; he then began to take upon hima captain’s command, and appointed a brigade to)f; act in every province, who were always to returnn (barring accidents) four times a year to the generald place of rendezvous, and give an account of theiro| success. And as soon as the booty was regularly di¬vided, each brigade was ordered to exchange posts,II and to march out on duty again. This was theirI constant practice for some years, by which policythey kept themselves concealed much longer thanotherwise they would have done. However, therewas no robbery committed any where at all in thekingdom but was attributed to captain O’Hanlon,4though it is probable he might have been an hun¬dred miles distant at the same time. Nay, so wellwas his character established, and so notorious hisactions, that it became a common proverb, whenany one had a mind to brand another with infamyand scandal, for him to say, You arc as great a rogueis Redmond O’Hanlon.As Redmond was once gliding along the roadbetween Newry and Armagh, like a kite in the airin quest of prey, with only two or three attendants,who were at some distance behind him, he overtooka pedlar crying out and bemoaning his misfortune,in a very moving and piteous manner : Redmondtaking compassion on the pedlar, came up, and askedhim what had befallen him? To whom the pedlarreplied, “ That damned rogue of a RedmondO’Hanlon has robbed me of above five pounds inmonies, which was all I had, and that would notsatisfy him neither, but he lias taken my box awaytoo ; and because I strove to hold it he knocked medown, and kicked and abused me like a dog.”Redmond, incensed at such language, had hardlypatience to hear the fellow tell out his story, beforehe interrupted him, and called him a rascal and alying son of a whore: “ How could 1 rob you,” saidhe, “that never saw you before? You dog, show mewhich way he went, and I’ll convince you that itwas none of Redmond O’Hanlon that robbed you.”By the time the fellow had described the robber,and showed the road ho took, Redmond’s companycame upt and they all went in pursuit of the newrogue, whom they overtook, with the pedlar’s boxunder his arm, and brought him back to the placewhere he committed the robbery. He knew him¬self guilty of the fact, and returned the pedlar bothhis money and box, without waiting to be examined,being no way acquainted with Redmond or any ofhis party. Tpon this captain O’Hanlon said, he5would teach him to rob in his name, ami withouthis license or permission. He bound the pedlar un¬der an obligation to prosecute the fellow at the nextensuing assizes, and then wrote a mittimus and sentthe criminal with a proper guard to the gaol of Ar¬magh. The pedlar was as good as bis word, andprosecuted him to the very utmost, upon which thefellow was found guilty, and accordingly executed.He was not altogether so destitute of friends butthat he had council to plead for him, who insistedvery much upon the error in commitment,* and pre¬vailed so far in court as to have the trial postponed;but this was of no other service than to give rise toas pleasant a fit of merriment in court as ever hap¬pened upon such an occasion, the judges aifd everyone else laughing till they were ready to burst atthe conceit of Redmond’s acting the justice of peace.Redmond had a much greater antipathy to theEnglish than to the Scotch and Irish ; for he wasalways kind to his countrymen, and made a bar¬gain both with them and the North country ped¬lars, and all such as acknowledged his jurisdictionall over the kingdom, alleging for excuse, that aslie was a reduced gentleman, he hoped his country¬men would not refuse to pay him tribute towardshis maintenance, upon his desisting to plunder.* Tho mittimus v,e are informed ran thus, By Redmond O’Hanlon,in loco of one of his Majesty’s justices of the peace for the said count>,but chief ranger of the mountains.‘1 herewith send you the body of , who was this day broughtbefore me and examined, for robbing Mr on the king’s road,requiring of you to hold him in safe custody till the next generalassize to be held for the said county, and for so doing this shall boyour sufficient warrant.*Given under my hand this 1st day of March, IBd.'j.Jo   Gaoler of Armagh.REDMOM D O’HANLON.6Upon this he made prosposals, that whoever paid himhalf-a-orown per annum, he would indemnify themfrom robbers of all kinds : but if at any time theyneglected to remit him his salary, and run in arrears,they were sure to pay for it. Such as made thisbargain with him, had their names registered in hispocket-book, and were so little afraid of losing anyof their goods by robbers, that they thought theireffects as safe in the fields as in the house; for if atany time they happened to have any thing stolen,upon application to Redmond, he would make themost diligent search that could possibly be made,through all parts of the kingdom, until he found itand restored it to the owner; and if he failed to findit, always allowed his benefactor two years salaryto compensate the loss. But he had so many emis¬saries, and such good intelligence, and all otherpetty rogues were so much afraid of him and hisparty, that none of them dared to disoblige him;and besides, every petty robber was served with acopy of the registered names, and had strict ordersnot to meddle with any thing that belonged to such,but to assist the loser in searching for his goods; sothat his friends seldom suffered under his protection.Having once got cold upon some desperate occa¬sion, it threw him into a dangerous fever, of whichhe recovered ; yet the place being damp where helay, he lost the use of his limbs, and continued acripple, or lame, for some years. Yet during thistime he was preserved among his friends, who hada great esteem for him, and escaped from being ta¬ken, though he was proclaimed a tory and a robber,and a reward of 501. was offered for taking him,which occasioned frequent searches after him. Helikewise was punctually paid his salary or tribute allthe time, by his benefactors or allies : (except a fewwho broke the truce, but dearly paid for it after:)though robberies were not so frequent during his7illness as before, so that he was under the necessityof making his pay maintain him till he was able togo about again.As soon as he had recovered the use of his limbs,he took the field again, and scoured all the roads inthe country, sometimes alone and .sometimes withcompany, and took special care to revenge himselfon all those who had neglected to send him his year¬ly pension when he was out of order; but foundhimself so closely hunted, that he fixed his headquarters in and about the bog of Allen for a con¬siderable time, where he committed such a numberof notorious robberies, that the people were oblig¬ed to keep under arms to guard their effects. Thogovernment taking this affair again into considera¬tion, a fresh proclamation was issued out offering areward of 2501. for the taking of him, upon whichseveral attempts were made to secure him, but tono effect; though he was once taken in bed nearClonbullock, but had the good fortune to be rescu¬ed by his comrades, as his captors were leading himto Naas gaol.Though he was very well acquainted all over thokingdom, yet he was loath to venture his carcaseany longer in this place, and among Strangers, forfear of a second disaster; so he took an opportunityof conveying himself privately to his old quarterson Slygunnin, where he remained some time, andcarried on his game, with great success, before hisenemies had time to seek him.Soon after his return, ho was in company withsome of his associates beyond Armagh, where theymet with cornet Montgomery’s steward, who hav¬ing received above 500h from his master’s tenants,on an estate he had in that country, was carryingit home to his own house, near Killevan in the coun¬ty of Monaghan, where he dwelt. Redmond stoodat a little distance all the time of the action, and8observed the dispute on both sides, and the defencemade by the steward, which, though he maintainedit with bravery for some time, yet was overpoweredby numbers, and obliged to deliver his purse to savehis life. When the booty was divided, captainO’Hanlon made a present of his part to the cornet’syoung son, who was at nurse in the same place,which he sent by the steward, with strict orders todeliver it, and took his acknowledgment for thesame payable on demand. This he did out of apure regard that he had for the cornet, on accouutof some favour he had done him formerly; andthe cornet to make him a requittal for so generousan action, made a promise that he would use hisbest endeavours to obtain the king’s pardon for him,in hopes of him forsaking his new trade; and was asgood as his word, as by the sequel will appear.A little after this action, a merchant in Dundalkhad a draught on a merchant in Newry, for a largesum, but was so much afraid of Redmond O’Han¬lon, that he was afraid either to send for the money,or to go for it himself. While he was thus consult¬ing with his wife how to get the money safely home,his apprentice, a lad about sixteen years of age,overheard their discourse, and as soon as he got anopportunity, desired his master to tell him why hewas so much afraid of sending to Newry ? Themaster having answered his request; the boy askedhim whether he would venture to trust him with somuch money ? The master said he did not doubthis honesty; but on that occasion lie could not knowwhat to think of the matter. However, by manyentreaties, the boy prevailed on the master to lethim go for the money, promising to forfeit his earsif he lost one halfpenny of it. The boy having ob¬tained privilege to go for the money, immediatelyset about preparing himself for the journey; and,by his master’s assistance, being provided with aboutI9forty shillings in halfpence, he divided them intotwo parcels, and tied them close up in a little wal¬let at each end, and then went to the field andI brought home an old vicious stone horse, (much ofi the same humour with Sir Teague O’Regan’s wari horse, on which he rode out to meet duke Scomberg' after the surrender of Charlemont,) that when anyother came up to meet him on the road, he alwaysstrove to bite or kick him, by which means he com¬monly kept the road to himself. With proper ac¬coutrements the boy mounted, and had the fortune!to meet Redmond on the road as he was going, who,as it was usual with him, demanded where he wasgoing ? The boy told him to Newry. Pray whatbusiness have you there ? says Redmond. Why, saysthe boy, to receive above IDOL for my master. Andwhen do you think you’ll be back? says Redmond.IWhy, says the boy, I believe about this time to¬morrow. Well, my good boy, says Redmond, youhad better take care not to tell every body whatyour business is, for fear you should be robbed.—Oh, says the boy, I’m sure such a gentleman as youwould not rob me, I do not intend to tell any bodyelse. Upon this Redmond made him a present ofa ducat to drink his health, or to hire another horse,if the one he had under him should tire ; and so1 they parted good friends for that time.Redmond was then under some necessities for aI little money; and as none of his companions werei present at the dialogue, he was resolved not to letE them know any thing of the matter, that he might: have all the booty to himself. And to make him¬self more sure of the prey, he ordered his comradesc to a different post the next morning, and waitedhimself alone on the road leading from Newry, tillil the boy returned.When the boy came in sight, Redmond saluted. i him, and, began to ask him the necessary questions10about the money.—The boy confessed that he hadreceived it, upon which the other desired him to lethim see it. The boy made several excuses, butthey all availed him nothing ; for, the other beganto demand with some authority, and would have ta¬ken hold of him, had lie not been something afraidof receiving a kick from the mad horse. Amongstother excuses, the boy alleged that his masterwould think he had made away with the moneyhimself, for which reason he could not part with it;but Redmond threatening to shoot him if he refus¬ed any longer, the boy took his wallet, and cast itover a slough by the road-side, and told Redmondthat if he must have it, he should follow it. Up¬on this Redmond alighted from his horse, and hav¬ing tied him to a tree, with some difficulty he gotto the place where the wallet lay. AYhilo he wasupon this expedition, the boy exchanged horses,much for the better, and rode home with speed,having the money he received at JN'ewry, safely quilt¬ed up in his waistcoat, and though Redmond calledafter him to stay, yet he left him to make the besthand he could of an old garron and a bag of half¬pence.Short after this, Redmond was presented withthe king’s protection for three years, on trial of hisgood behaviour, by cornet Montgomery, and re¬mained for the space of two years very inoffensivein the country, and kept company with some ofthe best gentlemen in the kingdom. However, tho’he knew well, if he had continued his good behavi¬our for tho term granted, he might have obtained ageneral pardon, yet this honest way of living didnot relish well with him : he had an itch to be atthe old game, and accordingly began it before thelimited time was expired, growing ten times morewicked and notorious than ever he had been before.In imitation of Oliver Cromwell, lord protector11of the commonwealth, he took upon him either thetitle of protector of the rights and properties of hisbenefactors and contributors, chief ranger of themountains, surveyor general of the high roads ofIreland, or lord examiner of all passengers, com¬mitting such villanies and barbarities on sturdy tra¬vellers, as were never heard of before, often drivingaway whole herds of cattle from such as, in comtempt of his protection and authority, had given himoffence by running in arrears. Yet he seldom rob¬bed a poor man, but on the contrary, was alwaysgenerous to men in necessity or distress.—Havingonce overtaken a poor man who had but one cow,which he was driving to a fair to be sold, to raisethe rent for his landlord, he asked him several ques¬tions, till he found certainly that he was in want,and then lent him five pounds, which he was to payhim at an inn a few weeks after. The poor manwent with the money according to compact, whichpleased Redmond so well that he bestowed it onhim, and five pounds more.He understood the art of dissimulation well;sometimes appearing like an officer, sometimes likea country gentleman, sometimes like a footman,and could alter the tone of his voice at pleasure; sothat the soldiers seldom knew him, though he oftengave them money to drink. The duke of Ormond,ordered a party of foot and horse to pursue him,who being informed where he was, but not mis¬trusting his disguise, went after him hot foot. Red¬mond dressed himself like an officer, and went qui¬etly along the high road, until ho saw the red coatsat a good distance behind him ; then he hastenedto a gentleman’s house near the road, and told himhe was an officer, who was sent out with a party ofmen in pursuit of Redmond O’Hanlon, but being alittle fatigued, made bold to call and rest himselfuntil his men came up; then desiring the people of12the 1 louse, to call him as soon as they passed by, hestretched himself clown to rest. The soldiers hadnot gone above an hundred yards past the end ofthe avenue, before Redmond went out on pretenceof meeting them at a style by the road side a quar- ,ter of a mile oft’; but his intent was to make hisescape another way, which he did for that timeunperceived.Not long afterwards he appeared in Armagh inthe habit of a country gentleman, and requested ofthe commanding officer there to let him have a fewmen to guard him about eight miles further, forfear of being met by any of Redmond O’Hanlon’sparty, because he had a charge of money about him.The request was granted. He and the men passedon very jocosely for about seven miles, when hetold them he was out of danger, and they might goback. He gave every man a piece of money, anddesired them to make a discharge for joy of his safepassage, which they did ; then he desired them tocharge and do the like again, until at length theytold him their ammunition was spent. This waswhat he expected, and giving a whistle, a parcel ofhis gang sprung out of the thicket, who stripped thesoldiers, in which shameful condition, they wereobliged to go back to their quarters.The escape he made at the four mile house, be¬tween Dundalk and Newry, may claim the reader’sattention. Being there overtaken by an officer andtwelve men, he was made prisoner; but seeming tohave a great respect for the soldiers, and they forhim, there was no dispute made. His ready com¬pliance and civility drew compassion from the mentowards him, and he treated them with North coun¬try whisky, taking care to drink sparingly himself,until they were all overcome with that heady liquor.While they were in this condition, he got them alltied neck and heels, and leaving them in that nosi-13I ture, marched off with their arms, which it seemsI he and his gang had occasion for.The government being justly incensed at this| proceeding, issued out a proclamation offering a: i reward for his head.A captain of foot being informed of one of his: I haunts, chose out twenty of the most active men inthe barrack, who stripped themselves to their waist-:; coats, and marched out in pursuit of him beforek break of day, with nothing but their muskets and3 i bayonets, and a little provision in their pockets,i 1 In about two hours they invested his castle of de-II fence, but had the mortification to hear him calla out from an adjacent hill bidding defiance, for it■ ii seems he had warning of their approach. Uponi this the military men held a consultation of war,f wherein it was resolved to divide themselves intoif three parties. The captain and ten men were toif follow the chace in the centre, and five men onlit each wing, who were always to keep within a quar-u ter of a mile of the main body. In this mannerid they followed him until noon. But at length, sev-jI eral of the men beginning to lag, the chace was onlymaintained by four, who kept so nigh him as tohave him in view the greatest part of the day. Inthe evening he hid himself in a knot of furze, abouthalf a mile from a small village, where several ofkis friends lived, intending to convey himself thi¬ther in the night, expecting that the soldiers wouldhave searched the village before it grew dark ; buthere he was entirely mistaken, for his pursuers,upon losing sight of him, suspected that he had hidhimself, and waited near the place until the wholecompany came up, and then made a diligent search,but to no purpose. Upon this they held a freshconsultation, not many yards from the place whereRedmond lay, and concluded to lie under covertillRedmond overheard the discourse.14and was resolved to steal away, but was preventedby the men’s walking to and fro to keep themselveswarm, until observing a smoke at a distance, theydrew near, thinking to refresh themselves. Theyfound a village, where they were furnished withfresh provisions. As they were returning to renewthe search, they observed a man at some distance,making to a cabin, whom they pursued, and foundthat they were still on the right scent. But Bedmond looking behind him, though he was exceed¬ingly hungry, altered his course, and the pursuitwas renewed with great warmth; and he was ob¬liged to hide himself next evening on the top of amountain, where he remained until break of day,and then he went to one of his friend’s houses toget something to eat.At his coming up to the door, one of the dogsbegan to bark, which alarmed the pursuers to thecentre, who lay not far olf; whereupon they allcame up in a body, and surrounded the house, justas Redmond sat down with a cake of bread, somebutter, and a can of milk before him. It was nowthe third day since he had eaten a morsel, and be¬ing almost spend for want of food, was just goingto put the first bit in his mouth, when the captainof the little army appeared at the door, with a verykind salutation, which Redmond returned with agentleman-like saying. Sir, I acknowledge that Iam your prisoner, and shall comply with your or¬ders immediately ; but gentlemen, you have beenhunting me these two days past, as I never washunted in my life. I had not time to put one bitin my mouth, until now, and 1 beg, sir, you’ll justleave me to eat my last breakfast with my friends;as soon as I have done you shall carry me whereyou please, and it will be no small honour to havethe credit of taking Redmond O’Hanlon; onlydon’t disturb me until I am ready. This privilege15was readily granted him, and the officer, with eightmen, stood at the door, resting on their arms, whilethe other twelve guarded the house on all sideswithout, until Redmond had done; then he startedup, taking his blunderbuss in his hand, and pre¬senting it to the officer, said, “ Now you take me foryour prisoner, but you must give me a little play,that the world should not have it to say that I wastaken so silly; you bear the title of captain, so doI; if you refuse to give me horse-room and car-room, I’ll discharge my piece at you this instant:I expect nothing but death, gentlemen, but yet amresolved to have fair play, and die honourably ; Ihave but one life to lose, you can take no more,and perhaps I’ll make three or four of you bearme company; for to gaol I never will go alive.'’This language surprised the officer, who seemedto give way a little, as though he had a mind toconsent; upon which Redmond forced out of thedoor, and escaped.It was about this time that Power, the greatestrobber in Munster, took a journey to the county ofArmagh, for the sake of seeing Redmond O’Han¬lon, of whom he had heal’d abundance of finestories. When he came near the place of Red¬mond’s abode, he put up at an inn. Observing agentleman, as he thought, telling over a good sumof money, he took care to be informed which roadhe intended to take in the morning ; upon whichhe pursued him, and overtook him. On comingup he demanded the money which he told him hesaw him reckoning the night before. The othertold him lie had money sure enough, but sworewhoever took it should fight for it: upon whicheach of them discharged a pistol without any dam¬age, and then drew their swords, with which theyfought some time on horseback. At length, look¬ing on one another, they forebore a while, and agreed1Gto alight and decide the quarrel on foot. Havingalighted, the victory was contended for with equalbravery and loss of blood on both sides, until theywere able to fight no longer : then sitting down tovest, “Pray,” says the Sampson of the north, “whoare you, or what’s your name ?” Upon this, theother confessed he was the chief robber of Munster,who hearing a great deal of Redmond O’Hanlon’sfame, came purposely to get acquainted with him.Says Redmond, “ Then you have satisfied your curi¬osity, for I am the man ; and I must confess youare the heartiest lad I ever met with—I never wasso worsted before.” So they kissed and becamefriends, and he made a league to tarry with Red¬mond a year and a half in the north ; but not re¬lishing bannocks and oatmeal, he returned to hisown country, and surveyed only the Munster roadsafterwards.Before he departed they made a truce, and pro¬mised to give one another notice if at any timeeither of them was put in prison, or in distress, thatthe one at liberty might rescue the other if possi¬ble. Soon after this the Munster tory was put intoClonmel gaol, for murdering a traveller, on Kilna-gowna, near the place where Patrick Sarsfield af¬terwards had the fortune to blow up King William’sartillery, and nail down the cannon. Accordingto their compact he wrote a letter to Redmond,which he communicated to his trusty comrades,Patrick Mactigh, John Reily, Shan Bernagh, Phil.Galloge, Pat. Meel, Arthur O’Neal, and the fam¬ous O’Quigley, they took the affair into considera¬tion ; but the time being very short, Redmondposted away alone, and only reached Clonmeltho evening before the Munster champion was ledout to Kilnagowna to be executed. Being in thehabit of a gentleman, he found means of communi¬cating to Power that he intended to set the town17on fire in several places that night, that while thepeople were in confusion he might have an oppor¬tunity of executing his design ; hut Power let himknow the danger of such an attempt, while a strongguard of soldiers were kept in the town, and dis¬suaded him from it by telling him of a much bet¬ter opportunity that would offer on the road thenext day, there being but a file or two of foot sol-diers with the sheriff to guard him; and so put himin a way of forming a probable stratagem for mak¬ing a rescue. Next morning the guard set out withthe prisoner, and having conducted him about halfway they stopped awhile at a public house on theroad to refresh themselves. The prisoner was leftunder the charge of four soldiers, while the otherssat in a large room at the other end, over a sup ofliquor. While they sat in this posture, Redmondappeared at the door in the dress of a gentleman,and having enquired the cause of the soldiers be¬ing there, he desired to see the prisoner, whichbeing readily granted to him, he called for wine totreat the men, and paid the whole reckoning. Thisbeing over, the officer called for more wine to treatthe gentleman, while the men were plied withliquor, by Redmond’s private orders, to facilitatehis design.As soon as found convenient, Redmond steppedout on pretence of making water, and lookinground about to see whether the coast was clear, heobserved eight men riding towards him, and foundthey were some of his own comrades, who had fol¬lowed to assist him. To be sure his comrades couldnever meet him in a more welcome time. Theyconsulted the manner of executing their design, andhad the luck to rescue Power in a very surprisingmanner, as follows: One of the gang held the horsesat the end of the house, whilst the rest followedRedmond into it, who opening a door that was in18the passage, to prevent any in the lower room fromlooking up into the other, stood there and madesome kind of a noise, not only to drown the voiceof those with the prisoner during the scuffle, but tohinder the others from coming out to see what thematter was, if there arose any suspicion. In themean while seven of the north-country robbers en¬tered into the little room, and taking advantage ofthe small guard, dispatched the four men so sud¬denly, that they had no time to cry out; and hav¬ing cut the cords wherewith the prisoner was bound,he followed them out, and mounted one of the hor¬ses with very little noise, and so made his escape tothe mountains. Redmond himself was the firstwho gave notice of the escape, and assisted thesheriff in pursuing the rescuers for several miles,until finding opportunity in the evening, he turnedoff short, and followed his comrades directly toLongford pass, near the bog of Allen.When the soldiers, in the barrack erected at Car-radelvin, had marched out of their quarters, andfresh ones had supplied their room, Redmond tookout with him eighteen men, and went in the nightto the barrack, to be revenged on the soldiers forthe severe hunting he got when he made his verysurprising escape. It seems the soldiers had nosuspicion of captain O’Hanlon’s adventure, forthey were all asleep, otherwise it appears impro¬bable that the raparees could open the door, andsteal away eighteen horses, unknown to the guard.However, so it was, the eighteen O’Hanloniansmade off with eighteen horses, to Ballibey, wherethere stood an old castle in the valley, at the footof a great hill. Here they alighted to observe howthe army behaved.How the robbery was discovered is not known,but this is a fact: eighteen horsemen, each witha foot soldier behind him, began the pursuit early19in the morning, and following the tracks of thehorses, came within sight of them about nine o’clockin the morning, in the valley aforesaid. As soonas captain O’Hanlon perceived the pursuers, heordered his men to draw up the horses into a half¬moon, and prepare for battle. His reason formaking out the circle was, that his men might keepthe face of the half-moon still towards the enemy;because he knew very well the dragoons did notpursue them with an intent to kill their own horses.In this posture they were just by the side of alarge trench, when the officer came within shot.Captain O’Hanlon gave the officer a fair challengeeither to decide the matter by a field battle, or togive three guineas a piece for the horses ; but theoffer was rejected, and several stratagems weremade use of by the officer to break the order of theraparees; which Redmond observing, and fear¬ing that the footmen would find a passage over thetrench, and get behind him while the rest were be¬fore, he thought proper to make a moderate offer,which was to return the horses at a guinea apiece,and to be allowed the liberty of marching off un¬molested : if this were refused, he swore that everyman he had should fire upon the army, making nodoubt but they should kill eighteen at least, andthat several of themselves would escape afterwards.This audacious challenge occasioned a council ofwar to be held, wherein it was concluded to givehim the last demand, with a privilege of retiringan hundred yards before a soldier moved from hisplace, to prevent the loss of men and horses. Amessenger was sent with the money ; which whencaptain O’Hanlon had received, he and his menretired behind the trench, which was before unper¬ceived by the officer, who otherwise, upon an ear¬lier discovery, might have made Redmond a pris¬oner. Thus this surprising adventure ended with¬out striking a blow.20This last action of Kedmond’s incensed the go¬vernment to the highest degree, and a fresh procla¬mation was issued out offering a reward of 400?.or more, for his head dead or alive, and 40?. apiecefor the eighteen men that were with him. Thefamily of the Cootes at Coote hill were very activeand successful in taking his comrades ; as likewisethe Johnstons of the Fews; and in a few years, themost of his chief men were executed, except Reilly,who fled for his life to France, where the sameCoote having killed a man, was tried and foundguilty. Reilly came to him, and told him he wasthen come to render good for evil; and accordinglyhelped him to make his escape to Ireland again.When Coote got home he enquired for Reilly’sfamily, and having found his father only in pos¬session of a small potato garden, one cow, and alittle cabin, on the mountain, he made him a free¬hold lease of a small piece of land, in the countyof Monaghan, which the Reilly family still enjoyto this day, and is now of very considerable valueand importance.Brien Kelly was the most active servant thatRedmond had, and merits a place in history (if arogue can have merit) almost as well as his master,having been in company with him in most of hisdaring enterprises, as well as in several more pri¬vate ; but as the particulars have not been told me1 shall only relate one, and let the rest lie in obli¬vion. While Redmond resided near Allen, Kelly,with two or three green-horn raparees, beset ahouse in the county of Kildare, and having a holemade in the wall, through which the whey wasusually conveyed into the swine trough, the servantmaid had occasion to go into the dairy, and obser¬ving that the hole was somewhat wider than before,mistrusted that all was not right. Upon this, shetook a large cleaver, and conveyed herself to the—421side of the hole. When all was hushed the handsfell to work again to pick out the stones of the wall,and made the hole wider, and presently came in ahead and shoulders, which the girl perceived, andmaking ready to give him a stroke, the fellow call¬ed to his comrades to bring him back, but the girlhad taken care to lighten the load, by cutting off thehead, which terrified the rest without so much, thatthey fled for the same, and nobody came afterwardsto challenge the dead, neither was it known who hewas, till Kelly, the great murderer, and robber, con¬fessed it afterwards in his last speech at the gallowsof Armagh. However, the girl was highly applaud¬ed. But now to return to Redmond and finish hislife.The gallows having destroyed many of Red¬mond’s notorious accomplices, and the large re¬wards that were offered by government for takinghimself, encouraged even private persons to endea¬vour, by every means, to take him. And the familyof the Johnstons of the Fcws, are at present veryserviceable to their country in apprehending toriesand raparees, and they were more so then.The vigilant Mr Johnston seldom let Redmondrest after his chief comrades were cut off, but huntedhim over hills and dales; but more particularlyonce, having notice that he was at Narrow Water,took some men, and pursued him hot foot almostto Carlingford, where, for fear that he should getand hide, and so convey himself away by sea in thenight, his passages were all intercepted, which Red¬mond observing, he made up to an alehouse by theriver side, at which time it happened there was noboat near hand, nor bridge within a mile and a halfof the place. By some means or other old John¬ston got notice of it, and hastened to the place,thinking it not possible for Redmond to escapeover so broad a river while the tide was in : for hehad no other wav left. When old Johnston andhis men came near, they observed that Redmondhad stript off his clothes and tied them on his back,with which he took to the river, and swam down,mostly under water, for above two hundred yards.This prevented him from receiving the shot of hispursuers, until out of danger. And what was asremarkable as this, when Mr Johnston set his dogafter him to seize him, the dog snapt at the coat,and at the same time Redmond turned about andtook hold of him by the throat, and dragged himalong with him under water, till he drowned himquite; for Redmond was a good swimmer. In alittle time he gained the bank on the other side ofthe river, then dressed himself, and fled directly toIsland Magee near Belfast, where he lurked pri¬vately for a year or more, till he thought the coun¬try had forgotten him, and then came up to thecounty of Armagh to make new adventures, butdid not reign long.He was now under more apprehensions of dan¬ger than ever, and appeared but seldom publicklyabroad. Yet, though he was somewhat advancedin years, he fell desperately in love with an inn¬keeper’s daughter, a very beautiful young woman,whom he prevailed upon, by entreaties and valua¬ble gifts, after a long suit, to yield to his lustfulembraces, upon a kind of sham marriage. How¬ever, he was very fond of her, and spent most ofhis time in her company, until her father hearingwho he was, and what reward was offered for hisapprehension, endeavoured to get her to betray him.But it was all to no purpose; for it only gave Red¬mond warning to conceal himself with more cau¬tion. At length one Douglas, a minister of theestablished church, in the parish where the youngwoman mostly resided, knowing she was broughtup a protestant, and that Redmond only went to23hear mass, (if he frequented any place of worshipi at all,) thought that she might he prevailed upon,i on this account, to make a discovery: hut all hisi endeavours seemed to he fruitless for a long time,i until Redmond took some occasion to abuse her;then this Douglas began to work on her again, andat last obtained his end. This young woman, ac¬cording to her promise to Douglas, took an oppor-itunity to send a messenger to him, and gave himnotice where Redmond was, just as he was goinginto bed after a hard fit of drinking. In a littletime a guard came up and took him asleep, and hewas hurried to Armagh, and put into gaol, withabout twelve stones of irons upon him, where he re¬mained till the assizes ; and being tried, was foundijiguilty of such a number of facts,* that he wasondemned, and his body ordered to be cut intobur quarters, and to be hung up in different places,,s a terror to others, notwithstanding which heave three surprising jumps in court, to show hisctivity, though so heavily loaded with irons.However, it is said that he was afterwards eithernlarged, or made his escape out of prison, for he diedit last by the hands of one of his own relations, (abster-brother,) who, for the sake of the large re-ujtaard (offered for Redmond’s head) caused his wife,o lay a wile for him, and she having betrayed himunder a pretence of giving him some refreshment,xe being weary stretched himself down to rest, and| vas shot through the head as he lay asleep in a1 >arn. He that shot him had the head carried onA i staff to Armagh, and got the thanks of the wholef * What the old women say of his mother’s dreams, of her going tod onsult an Astrologer upon his birth, and of his having a T on his•reast when born, is all a story and a fiction; though it is certain,hat his exploits spread his fame through most countries in Europe.3 n England he was called captain O’Hanlon, but in France countr.IVHanlon, by all his fraternity.country, besides the reward at the ensuing quartersessions.Thus ended the memorable life of that notorioushighwayman and robber, Redmond O’Hanlon, onwhom there was a very curious song composedafter his death, though never printed. * But storiesconcerning him differ greatly; nevertheless, had allhis exploits and actions been recorded, they wouldhave made as remarkable a history as most of theIrish giants.# And though some soldiers lost their lives in the rescue of Power,yet he was entirely against it, and intended only to overdo them byliquor, Kelly was the chief actor in the tragedy, therefore Redmondought not to bear the scandal of so foul a deed.

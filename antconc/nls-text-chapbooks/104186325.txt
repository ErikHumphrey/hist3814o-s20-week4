CALDWELL, HIGH STREET,• 1828.[price one penny.]\'i JTHUPOPULAR STORY'OFA long time ago, and at a considerable dis¬tance from any town, there lived a gentleman,who was not only in possession of great riches,but of the largest estates in that part of the ,country. Although he had some very ele¬gant neat mansions on his estates, he generallyresided in a magnificent castle, beautifullysituated on a rising ground, surrounded withgroves of the finest evergreens, and other choicetrees and shrubs.• ( 4 )The inside of this fine castle was even morebeautiful than the outside ; for the roomswere all hung with the richest damask, cu¬riously ornamented ; the chairs and solas werecovered with the finest velvet, fringed withgold ; and all his table dishes and plates werec itber of silver or gold, finished in the most,t began t stvle. Id is carriages and horses mighthave served a king, and perhaps were finerthan any monarch’s of the present day. Thegentleman’s appearance, however, did not al-t getlier correspond with his wealth ; for, to afierce disagreeable countenance, was added anugly blue beard, which made him an object ofrear and digsust in the neighbourhood, wherehe usually went by the name of blue beard.There resided, at some considerable dis¬tance from Blue Beard’s castle, an-old lady; --d her two daughters," who were people of;some rank, but by no means wealthy. Thetwo young ladies were very pretty, and the'1 t ie of their beauty having reached Bluei k-ard, he determined to ask one of them in •v;:.triage. Having ordered a carriage, he<Tied at their house, where he saw the two;vmuug ladies, and was very politely received t■j; their mother, with whom he begged a lewmoments c o it vernation.' ( 5 )After the two young ladies left the room,he began by describing his immense riches,and he told her the purpose of his visit,begging she would use her interest in his fa-vour. They were both so lovely, he said, thathe would be happy to get either of them forhis wife, and would therefore leave it to theirown choice to determine upon the subject, andimmediately took his leave.When the proposals of Blue Beard werementioned to the young ladies by their mother,both Miss Anne and her sister Fatima pro¬tested, that they would never marry an uglyman, and particularly one with such a fright¬ful blue beard ; besides, although he possess¬ed immense riches, it was reported in thecountry, that he had married several beauti¬ful ladies, and nobody could tell what hadbecome of them.Their mother said, that the gentleman was•agreeable in his conversation and manners;that the ugliness of his face, and the bluebeard, were defects which they would soonbe reconciled to from habit; that his immenseriches would procure them every luxury theirheart could desire ; and he was so civil, thaishe was certain the scandalous reports about.,bis wives must-be entirely with foundation.( 5 )The two young ladies, who were as civilas they possibly could, in order to concealthe disgust they felt at Blue Beard, andto soften their refusal, replied to this effect:—That, at present, they had no desire to changetheir situation ; but, if they had, the one sistercould never think of depriving the other of sogood a match, and that they did not wish tobe separated.Blue Beard having called next day, the oldlady told him what her daughters had said ;on which he sighed deeply, and pretended tobe very much disappointed ; but, as he hadthe' mother on his side, he still continued hisvisits to the family. Blue Beard, knowing theattractions that fine houses, fine furniture, andline entertainments, have; on the minds ofladies in general, invited the mother, her twodaughters, and two or three other ladies, whowere then on a visit to them, to spend a day ortwo with him at his castle.Blue Beard’s invitation was accepted, andhaving spent a considerable time in arrangmgtheir wardrobe, and in adorning their persons,they all set out for the splendid mansion ofBlue Beaj'd-On coming near the castle, although theyhad heard a great deal of the taste and ex-pense that had been employed in decorating it,they were struck with the beauty of the t reesthat overshadowed the walks through whichthey passed, and with the fragrance cf thedower* vj’feich perfumed the air. When theyreached the castle, Blue Beard, attended by unumber of his servants in splendid dresses, re¬ceived them with the most polite courtesy, andconducted them fro a magnificent drawingroom.An elegant repast was ready in the dining¬room, to which they adjourned. Here theywere again astonished by the grandeur of theapartment and the elegance of the entertain¬ment, and they felt so happy, that the even¬ing passed away before they were aware.Next day, after they had finished breakfast;the ladies piSeeecled to examine the picturesami furniture of the rooms that were open, andwere truly astonished at the magnificence thatevery where met their view.1 he time rolled pleasantly away amidst «succesioa of the most agreeable amusements,consisting of hunting; music, dancing, andbanquets, where the richest wines, and mosttempting delicacies, in luxurious profusion,presented them in every direction.The party felt so agreeable amidst thesescenes of festivity, that they continued at thecastle for several Jays, during which thecunning Blue Beard, by every obsequiousservice, tried to gain the favour of his fairguests. Personal attentions, even althoughpaid us by an ugly creature, seldom fail tomake a favourable impression, and therefore' it was no wonder that Fatima, the youngest ofthe two sisters, began to think Blue Beard avery polite, pleasant, and civil gentleman, andthat the beard, which she and her sister hadbeen so much afraid of, was not so very blue.A short time after her return home, Fa¬tima, who was delighted with the attentionwinch had been paid her at the castle, toldher mother that she did not now feel anyobjections to accept of Bh» Beard as a husband.The old lady immediately communicated tshim the change of her daughter’s sentiments.Blue Beard, who lost no time in payingthe family a visit, was in a few days privatelymarried to the young lady, and soon after theceremony, Fatima, accompanied by her sister,returned to the castle the wife of Blue Beard.On arriving there, they were received at theentrance by all his retinue, attired in splendiddresses, and Blue Beard, after saluting hisbride, led the way to an elegant entertainment,where, every thing that could add- to the-r com( 3 )fort being prepared, they spent the eveningin the most agreeable manner.The next day, and evety succeeding day,Blue Beard always varied the arntuernent:-;,and a month had passed away imperceptibly,when he told Iih wife that he was obliged toleave her for a few weeks, as he had someaffairs to transact in a distant part of thecountry, which required his personal attend-ance.“ But,” said he, “ my dear Fatima, youmay enjoy yourself during my absence inany way that will add to your happiness, andyou can invite your friends to make the timepass more agreeably, for you are sole mistressin this castle. Here are the keys rf the twolarge wardobes; this is the key of the greatbox that contains the best plate, which we usefor company ; this of my strong box, whe/eI keep my money ; and this belongs to thecasket, in which are all my jewels. Here alsois a master-key to ail the rooms in the honse ;but this small key belongs to the blue close.at the end of the long gallery on the ground-floor. 1 give you leave,” he continued," toopen, or do what you like with all the restot the castle except this closet: now, mVdear, remember you must not enter it, no’;(10)even put the key into the lock. If you donot obey me in this, expect the most dreadfulof punishments.”She promised implicit obedience to his or*rlers, and then accompanied him to the gate,where Blue Beard, after saluting ber in a ten¬der manner, stepped into the coach, and droveaway.When Blue Beard was gone, Fatima senta kind invitation to her friends to come im¬mediately to the castle, and ordered a grandentertainment to be prepared for their recep¬tion. She also sent a messenger to her twobrothers, both officers in the army, who werequartered about forty miles distant, requestingthey would obtain leave of absence and spenda lew days with ber. So eager were her friendsio see the tine apartments and the riches ofBlue Beard’s castle, of which they had heardso much, that in less than two hours after re¬ceiving the notice, the whole company wereassembled, with the exception of her brothers,who were not expected till the following day.As her guests had arrived long before thetune appointed for the entertainment, Fati¬ma took them through every apartment inthe castle, and displayed all the wealth shehad acquired by her marriage with Blue' 11)Beard. They went from room to room, andfrom wardrobe to wardrobe, expressing freshwonder and delight at every new object theycame to ; but their surprise uas increased whenthey entered the drawing-rooms, and saw thegrandeur of the furniture. In short, nothingcould exceed the richness of what they saw,and they could not help admiring and envyingthe good fortune of their hostess.On being told that e\ery thing was ready,Fatima conducted her guests to the dining¬room, where they sat down to a most magni¬ficent repast, served up in dishes and coversof the finest gold. Musioand other amuse-snents succeeded, and the night was far ad¬vanced before the company left the castle.During the day, Fatima was so much en¬gaged, that she never once thought of theblue closet, which Blue Beard had given hersuch strict commands not to open ; but whenall the visitors were gone, and she had retiredto hei chamber, the restrictions that BlueBeard had put upon her not to examine thecloset, raised her curiosity to know its con¬tents to such a degree, as to be almost irre¬sistible.She took out the key, which was made ofthe linest gold, with several characters en-( 12 )graved on the handle, and after examining ifccarefully, she went to consult with her sisteron the subject that engrossed all her thoughts.Anne used every argument she could think ofto persuade Fatima against the imprudenceof her desires, in wishing to pry into whatBlue Beard had so strictly forbidden, and alsoreminded her of the threats he had used ; butthey were all in vain, for her remonstrancea on¬ly served to raise Fatima’s curiosity the higher,and she determined to gratify it, whatever theresult might be.From the lateness of the hour, she knewthere was no danger of her being observed byany of tiie servants, therefore, in spite of allthat her sister could do, she seized one of thecandles, and hurried down the stairs to the fa-tabcloset. On reaching the door she stopped,and began to reason with herself on the pro¬priety of her conduct; but her anxiety to knowwhat the closet contained, and thinking, asBlue Beard was so very fond of her, that hewould easily forgive her disobeying him, she,with a trembling hand, applied the key to thelock, and opened the door.After unlocking the door, she remained afew moments undetermined whether to proceedor not, but her curiosity urged her forward j( 13 ) •and as she olsservod nothing to intimidate her,she entered with some little degree of resolu-tion. She had only advanced a few steps,when the most frightful scene met her view,and, struck with horror and dismay, she droptthe key of the closet. She was in the midstof blood ; and the heads, bodies, and the muti¬lated limbs of murdered ladies) lay scatteredon the floor. These ladies had all been mar¬ried to blue beard, and had suffered for theirimprudent curiosity.Blue Beard’s first wife was a bold-spiritedwoman, with whom he quarrelled soon aftermarriage ; and having in the bent of his an¬ger murdered her, he concealed the body inthis blue closet. The rest of his wives, who,like Fatima, could not refrain from indulgingtheir curiosity, he had killed for acting con¬trary to his express commands ; and the key,which was the gift of a fairy, had always be¬trayed their fatal disodedience.The terror of Fatima, whose blood waschilled within her, while her hair stood onend, was not diminished on discerning thesedreadful wmrtls on the wall, in large charac-ters—“Tift Reward of Disobedience andimprudent Curiosity /” She trembled violent¬ly ; but, on recovering a little, she summoned( U )sufncient resolution to snatch up tha hey, andleave this abode of horror and dismay. Al¬most without knowing what she did, from theagitated state of her mind, she closed the doorbehind her, and locked it.As she went up stairs, her imagination con¬jured up the ghosts of these murdered ladiesto her view, and, a faintness coming over her,she was obliged for a few moments to leanagainst the bannister, to regain strength e-noagh to reach her sister’s chamber, to whomshe related the whol® of her horrid adventure.On her sister inquiring, if she locked thedoor, Fatima produced the key, but it was ailcovered with blood, and they both turned palewith fear. They spent a great part of thenight in trying to clean off the blood from thekey, which was the only evidence of Fatima’simprudccne j but it was without effect; forthough they washed and scoured it with brick-dust and sand, no sooner was the blood remov¬ed from one side than it appeared on the oth¬er. Fatigued with their exertions, they atlast retired to bed ; but the wretched Fatima,who could not sleep, lay ruminating on theawful scene she had gone through, and devis¬ing means for escaping the vengeance of thecruel Blue Beard.C ™ )Fatinia rose at a late hour next day, and,; after breakfast, she consulted with her sisterhow she ought to proceed. As Blue Beardwas to be absent for some weeks, she thoughtof making her e«cape from the castle beforehis return ; hut as her brothers were expectedin an hour or two, she resolved to tell themwhat had taken place, and be guided by theiradvice.—A loud knock at the gate made heralmost leap for joy, and she cried,“ They erecome! they arc com.e!” but what was hocconsternation when Blue Beard hastily open¬ed the door, and entered ! It was impossi¬ble for Fatima to conceal her agitation, whileBlue Beard mentioned without seeming toobserve her uneasiness, that he had been metby a messenger, who was *n the way to thecastle to prevent his journey, aad therefore hispresence there would not now be necessary.Fatima pretended to be very happy at hissudden return, and said every thing she couldthink of to please him ; but Blue Beard, whoguessed what she had been about, requestedthe keys, in order, as he said, that he mightchange his dress. She went to her chamber,and soon returned with the keys, all exceptthe one belonging to tbo blue closat, and putthem into his hand. He took the keys(If')from her with seeming indifference, and af- jter glancing at them minutely, said, rathersternly, “ How is this, Fatima? I do notsee the key of the blue closet here ! Go andbring it to me instantly.”The poor girl, feeling the crisis of her fate :approaching, said,“ 1 will go and «earch forit,” and left the apartment in tears. She wentstraight to her sister’s chamber, whore theyagain tried every means, but in vain, to re¬move the blood from the key. She Continueda few minutes agitated and irresolute, but thevoice of Blue Beard calling for her, left notime for consideration, and she was forcedto return to the apartment where she had lefther husband, and reluctantly to give him thefatal key.On receiving the key, Blue Beard, afterexamining it, burst into a terrible rage, andsaid with great harshness,—“ Pray, madam, how came this blood tobe here ?”*• I am sure I do not know,” rep-lied shetrembling;, and turning; bale.“ What ! do you not know ?” Blue Beard,in a voice like thunder, which made poorFatima start with fear ; “hut 1 know well! Vonhave bees in the forbidden blue closet ! And( 17 )since you are so fond of prying into secrets,you shall take up your abode with the ladiesyou saw in that closet. Now, madam, expectno mercy, as nothing can alter your fate. Thepunishment you shall receive is only the just•award of your disboedience and imprudentcuriosity/’*Almost expiring with tenor, the tremblingFatima sunk upon her knees, and imploredhim in the most piteous manner to forgive her.While supplicating him to spare her life, shelooked so mournflly in his face, that it wouldhave melted any heart which was not harderthan stone. However, it had no effect on thecruel Blue Beard ; for he drew his dreadfulscimetar, and desired her to prepare for im¬mediate death.Blue Beard had raised his arm to perpe-t;ate the horrible deed, when a dreadfulshiick from her sister, who at that momententered the apartment, arrested his attention,Her sister entreated him to spare the life ofF; tiraa, but he was deaf to her intcrccssicn,and the only favour that the relentless tyrantwould grant to her entreaties, was a respiteof a quarter of an hour, that she might makeher peace with Heaven before he put her todeath.( is )Blue Beard, after he had promised to allowthis, in order to secure his viction during theshort space allotted her for prayer, and thathar screams, or groans, might not resell thedomestics, led, or rather dragged her up toa large hall, in the tep of the tower of thecastle, to which they were followed by her sis¬ter. He then told her to make the best useof the time, as «he might expect his returnthe moment it elapsed, and immediately leftthe place.When alone with her sister, Fatima felther dreadful situation, and again burst intotears. Only fifteen minutes between her andthe most cruel death, without the least chanceof escape; for Blue Beard had secured thedoor when he retired, and the staircase theysaw only led to the battlements. Fatima’sthoughts were now turned to her brothers,whom she expected that day, and she request¬ed her sister to ascend to the top of the tow¬er, to see if there was any appearance of them,for on them her whole expectation of deliver¬ance now rested ; ®r, if she saw any personapproaching, to beckon them to come to herassistance.Fatima’s, sister immediately ascended to thetop of the battlemeaits, where she stood tO'Ob-( 19 )serve if any one approached the castle, whilethe poor trembling girl below, every minute,cried out, “Sister Anne, my dear sister Anne,do you «ee any person approaching ye?”Her Sister always replied, “ There is nota human being in view, and I see nothingbut the sun and the gras*.”She was upon her knees bewailing her fate,when slue Beard, in a tremendous voice criedout, “ Are you ready ? the time is expiredand she heard the sound of his footsteps ap¬proaching.She again supplicated him to spare her life,but he refused; and he was proceeding toseize her, when she entreated five minuteslonger to iluish her prayers, blue beard, know-ing she was completely in his power, andwithout the least chance of escape, grantedher the five minutes she had requested, andtiien retired.Fatima again renewed her inquiries to hersister ; “ Do you see no one coming yet ?”Her sister repied, “ There is not a humanbeing within sight.”When the five minutes were elapsed, thetfoiee of blue beard was heard bawling out,“Are you ready yet ?”She again beseeched him to allow her only- . *V( 20 )two minutes more, and then addressed hersister, “ Dear Anne, do you see any onecomino; vet ?”c) J“ I see,” said her sister, “a cloud of dusfcrising a little to the left.”In breathless agitation, she cried, “ Doyou think it is my brother* ?”“ Alas ! no, my dearest Fatima,” returnedher sister, “ it is only a flock of sheep.”Again the voice of blue beaad was heard,and she begged for one minute longer. Shethen called out for the last time, “ SisterAnne, do you see no one coming yet?”Her sister quickly answered, “I see twomen on horseback, but they are still a greatway off.” . •The hope of deliverance made Fatima ex¬claim, in the ecstasy of the moment, “ ThankHeaven!, thank Heaven! I shall yet besaved, for it must be my two brothers!—mydearest sister, make every signal in yourpower to hasten them forward, 01 they willbe too late to prevent my fate.”Blue Beard’s patience being now exhaust¬ed, he burst open the door in a rage, and madea blow with his scimetar at the wretched Fa¬tima, with the intention of striking off herhead; but she sprang close to him and evaded(■21)it. Furious at being foiled in his aim, hethrew her from him, and then seizing her bythe hair of the head, vva» in the act of strik¬ing her a blow with his scimetar, which wouldhave terminated her existence, when the noiseof persons approaching, with hasty steps, ar¬rested the progress of his sanguinary arm.blue beard had not time to conjecture whothe intruders might be, when the door open¬ed, and two officers, with their swords drawn,rushed into the apartment•Struck with terror, the guilty wretch re¬leased his wife from his grasp, and withoutattempting to resist, he tried to effect Ins e-scape from the resentment of her brothers;but they pursued, and seized him befote hehad got above twenty paces from the place.After reproaching him with his cruelty, theydragged him back to the spot where he in¬tended to have murdered their sister; andthere, stabbing him to the heart with theirswords, he expired, uttering the most horridoaths and imprecations.Fatima, who had fallen to the ground atthe time blue beard quitted the hold of her,still lay in the same situation insensible; forthe appearance of her brothers, at the mom¬ent she expected certain death, had thrown( 22 )her into a faint, which continued during thewhole of the time they were engaged in des¬patching her husband,The two young officers now turned theirattention to their sister, whom they raised fromthe ground, but she could hardly be persuad¬ed of her safety, till they pointed to whereblue beard lay extended lifeless.Fatima, on recovering a little, tenderly em-bracsd her deliverers: and the appearance oftheir sister Anne, who had come down fromthe top of the battlements, added to theirhappiness.As all those horrid murders which hadbeen committed by blue beard were unknownto his domestics, on whose credulity he im¬posed by falsehoods, which they had no meansof detecting, Fatima and her brothers thoughtthe most prupent way to act, was to assemblethem together, and then disclose the wicked¬ness of their late master.By the directions of Fatima, her two bro¬thers conducted all the servants to the dread¬ful scene of her husband’s cruelties, and thenshewing them his dead body, related thewhole occurrences which had taken place.They 'dl said that his punishment was not a--dequate to what he deserved, and begged thatthey might be continued in the service of theirmistress. As blue beard had no relations,Fatima was sole heir to the whole of his im¬mense property, and mistress of the castle, inthe possession of which she was confirmed bythe laws of the country. She then sent no¬tice to all the families in the neighbourhoodof the death of her husband, and the horridproofs of his cruelty were laid open for twodays to all who chose to inspect them. Hewas then buried privately, along with all thebedies of the ladies he had murdered, andthe fatal closet underwent a complete repair,which removed every trace of his barbarity.Soon after this, Fatima gave a magnificententertainment to all her friends, where hap¬piness was seen in every face ; and on thisoccasion the poor, who were assembled formany miles round, partook most liberally ofher bounty. Though possessed of riches al¬most inexhaustible, Fatima disposed of themwith so much discretion, that she gained theesteem of every one who knew her. She be¬stowed handsome fortunes on her two bro¬thers ; and to her sister, wh® was married a-bout twelve months aftei, she gave a verylarge dowery.The beauty, riches, and amiable conduct( 2* )of Fatima, attracted a number of admirers,and among others, a young nobleman of veryhigh rank, who to a handsome person, addedevery quality calculated to make a good hus.band, and after « reasonable time spent incourtship, their marriage was celebrated withgreat rejoicings.THE END.ill

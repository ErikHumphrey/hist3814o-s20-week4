write,Store of wealth and beauty bright.She had left by a good grannum,Full five thpusand pounds per annum,'.Vhioh she held without controll;Thus she did in riches roll.1 ho’ she had vast store of riches,Which some persons much bewitches,Yet she bore a courteous mind,Not the least to pride inclin’d.Many noble persons courtedThtf iyoUfcgdatlyi ’tis reported,3But their labour prov’d in vain,They could not her favour gdtv.^ Tho’ she rtiide siich ti'ue reslstartce,Yet by Cupid’s true assistance,She was conquer’d after all.How it fcaS declare T shall.Being at a noble weddiiig,Near the famous town of Reddi'rlg,A young gedtleman shesiw, ° :!Who belonged to the law.As she view’d nis sweet behaviour,Every courteous carriage gave heeNew addittoinb to her grief;Forc’d she was to seek relief.Privately she then enquir’d,About him so rriuch admir'd,Both his naonvand where he dwelt.Such was the hot flames she felt.Then at night this youthful lady),Cali d her coach, which being ready.Homeward straight she did return.But her b^t in flames did burn.PART If.■ l-~>• 1 .TV?.’ '■ luqf. i -()Night and morning for a season,In her closet would she ReasonWith herself, and often said,Why has love my heart betray’d ?I that have so many slighted,Am at length so well requited,For my griefs are not a few lNow I find what love ban dcu4He that has tny heart in keeping,Tho’ l for his sake be weeping;Little knows what gtief 1 feel,But I’ll try it out with $^.3 yd j9YFor I will a challenge send,him,And appoint where I’jl attend him ;In a grove witho it delay,By the dawning, pf the day.He shall not the least discover,That I am a virgin lover.By the chaliengc which I s.md ;But for justice l contend.He has caused sad distraction,And I come for satisfaction,Which if he denies to give,One of us shall cease to live.Having thus her mind reveal’d, ' ■She her letter closed and sealed.Now when it came to his hand.The young man was at a stand.;In her letter she conjur’d him,For to meet, and well assurd him,Recompence he must, afford,Or dispute it with the sword.Having read the strange relation,He was in a consternation ;Thsn advising with his fiiend, r| ,He persuades him to attend.Be of courage and make ready,Faint heart never won fair lady,In regard it rhust be so,I along with you will go.5PART Ilf.Early on a summer’s morning,When bright Pheebns was adorningEvery bower with his beams,The fair lady came it seems.At the bottom of the mountain,Near a pleasant crystal fountain ;There she left her gilded coach,While the grove she did approsnh,Covered with her mask and walking.There she met her lover talkingWith a frienil that he had brought;Straight she ask’d him, who she sought.I am challenged bj' a gallant,Who resolves to try my talent;Who he is 1 cvnnot say,But I hope to shew him play.It is that I did invite you,You shall wed me or I’ll fight yon,Underneath those spreading trees;Therefore choose you which you please.You shall find I do not vapour,I have brought rnv trusty rapier,Therefore take your choice says she,Either fight or marry me.Said he, malam, pray what mean you ?In my life I never'saw you ;Pray unmask, your visage ahow,Then I’ll tell you Aye or No.I will not my face uncover,Till the marriage ties are over,6Therefore choose you which you will,Wed me, sir, or try your skill.Step within that pleasant bower,,With your friend one single hour,Strive your thoughts to reconcile,And I wiil wander here the while.While this charming lady waited,The young bachelors debated,What was best for to be done ;Quoth his friend, the hazard run.If my judgment may be trusted,Wed her first, you can’t be worsted,If she’s rich, you’ll rise to-fame,If she’s poor, why you’re the same.He consented to be married,In her coach they all were carried,To a church without delay,Where he weds the lady gay.The sveet pretty Cupids hovetf’d,Hound her eyes, her face was covirdWith a mask, he took her thus,Just for better or for worse.With a courteous kind behaviour^She presents his-friend a-fovotair, r..And withal dismiss’d hkn straight^That he might no longer waifo 1FART IV. .As the gilded coach stood realy,The young lover and his lady,Rode together till they cameTo her house of state and fame.7Which appeared like a castle,Where he might behold a parcelOf young coders tall a d straight,Just before her palace gate.Hand in hand they walked together,To a hall or parlour rather,Which was beautiful and fair,All alone she left him there.Two long hours there he waited,Her return at length he fretted,And began to grieve at last,For he had not broke his fast.Still he sat like one amazed,Hound a spacious room he gazed,Wrhich was richly beautify’d ;But, alas ! he lost his bride.There was peeping, laughing, sneering,All within the lawyer’s hearing :But his bride he ypuld not see;Would I w’as at home thought he.While his heart was melancholy,Said the Stewart brisk and jolly,Tell me friend, how ca ne you hare 3 <You have some design I fear.He reply’d dear loving master,You shall meet with no disaster,Through my means in any case,Madam brought me to this place.Then the Steward did retire,Saying that he would enquire,Whether it was true or no;Never was love hamp¥rgd[s^.8Now the lady who had fill’d him'A ith those fears, lull well beheld himFrom a window, where she drest,Pleased at the pleasant jest.When she had herself attired,In rich robes to be admired,.Site appeared in his sight.Like a moving angel bright.Sir, my servants have related,How you have some hours waitedIn my parlour, tell me whoIn my house you ever knew.Madam if 1 have offended,It is more than 1 Intended ;A young lady broyght me here,That is true said she my dear.I can be no longer bruinTo my joy and only jewel,Thou art mine and 1 am thine,Hand

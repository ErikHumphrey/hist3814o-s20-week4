THETHE AULD KIRK O' PERT.PRINTED FOR THE BOOKSELLERS.HERD’S GHAIST;OR, THEPERJURED LAIRD’S DOOM.A LEGEND OF THE AULD KIRK O’ PERT.TO WHICH IS ADDEDNANCY BEAN—A SKETCH.THE HERD’S GHAIST.Thf following Scottish ballad illustrates a traditionhaving reference to the parish of Pert, now united tothat of Logy, in the north-eastern part of Forfarshire;and also embodies some superstitions of the samelocality, with respect to the supposed power of con¬juring or laying ghosts. It is however becomingobsolete by the removal of many of the old families ofthe district, and ere long may possibly pass out ofmemory. By some of the older folks the tale is thusnarrated:—A simple herd-boy having excited the ireof the laird of Pert, the latter, a powerful man, flungthe unconscious victim of his anger among a cairn ofstones, and thereby killed him on the spot. The cir-cumstanecs having caused judicial inquiry, the laird,toaiculpate himself, charged one of his own hinds withthe perpetration of the murder, for which, in thosedays when “might was right,” the poor man washanged. The fact was however traditionally trans¬muted, and the particulars, as related in the ballad,obtained a general belief among the peasantry, viz.,that, till the conjurations of the miller, the boy hadwandered under the murky cloud of night, between thekirk of Pert, and an old ford in the river below theNorth-water bridge.The old kirk of Pert, so prominent in the ballad, is.sow a picturesque ruin upon the banks of the NoHb3Eslc, not unlike that of “auld haunted” Allowar on theDoon, eternised by Robert Burns. The locality hasotherwise many attractions, both historical and literary.A few paces south of the Upper North-water bridge,was born in a humble cottage, James Mill, the historianof British India, father of the late J. S. Mill, M. P., thecelebrated political economist; while the bridge itself,which was built by Superintendent Erslcine of Unit,was used as a resting place or prison, for the Cove¬nanters when on their way from the South of Scotlandto Dunnottar Castie, in 168d.When’er the gowden sun gade doun,An’ gloomie ev’nin’ fell;Frae a fireless flame of azure hue,By foot o’ Pert’s kirke bell;Ane winsome boy there wont to come,With slae black eyne an’ hair;His cheiks an’ line were deadfie pale,An’ head an’ feet wore bare.Thoch lang atween the kirke an’ furde,This sprite a-wanderin’ went,Nae livin’ either heard its tale,Or cause o’ mourning kent.But ae dark nichte *s ane miller chiel’Had 1 angst the road to gae,The lad kept rinnin’ by his side,Lamentin’ o’er his wae4An’ when they reach’d the kirseyard style,He cry'd—“ 0 list to me;An ’set ane harmless murdert boy,Frae lanelie wand’rin’ free! ”The sturdie miller aft heard tellThat sic a sprite was seen:Thoch laith to bide ane ghastlie ca’,At last he’s courage ta’en,An’ ’bout himsell wi’ hazell staff,He made aae roundlie score;Then said—“My lad, in name o’ Gude,*What doe ye wander for ?

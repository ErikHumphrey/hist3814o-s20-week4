No man needed to offer him cheefsand bread, after he curft he would not have it: forhe would blufh at bread and milk, when hungry,as a beggar doth at a bawbee. He got the name ofJohn Cheap the Chapman, by his felling twenty need¬les for a penny, and twa leather laces for a farthing.He fvvore no oaths but one, which was, Let menever fin ■!He gave bad counfel to none but children, toburn the bone-combs, that their mother might buyanother when he came again.He never fought with any but dogs, and thegood-wives* daughters in their dafling, and taat*?not dangerous.3The Hi/lory e/*, &c.FART I.The following Relation is taken from his ownmouth verbatim.I JOHN CHE AP, by chance, at feme certaintime, doubtlefs againft my will, was born at theHottom, near Haberteboy mill: My father was acots Highlandman, and my mother a Yorkfhirewench, but hontft, which caufes me to be of amongrel kind : I made myfelf a chapman when veryyoung, in great hopes of being rich when 1 becameold ; but fortune was fickle, and fo was 1; for I hadrot'been a chapman above two days, until I beganto conlider the danger of deep ditches, midden-dvvb?,biting dogs, and bogies in barns, bangfter wives andwet lacks : And what comfort is it, fays I, to ly iaa cow’s ouxter, the lerg-.h of a cold winter night ;to fit behind backs, tdl the kail be a’ ecktied up,and then to lickcolley’s leavings.My firh journey was through old Kilpatrick. Allthe day long I got no meat ncr money, until theevening, began to a fit for lodging, then everywife to get me >way, would either give me a cog-full-of'kail, or a piece of cake. Well, fays I to my¬felf, if this be the way, i fit all begin in the morn¬ing to afk for lodging, or any time when I amhungry. Thus i continued going from houfe tohouie, until my belly was like to burft, and mypockets could hold no more ; at laft I came to afarmer’s houfe, but thinking it not dark enough toprevail for lodging, I fat down upon a ftone at theend of the houfe, tilt day light would go away outof the weft ; and as I was getting up to go intothe houfe, out comes the goouwife, as I fuppofed,her to be, an<^ fat down at rtre end of the ftoneI being at the othek, there fhe began to «*ake off4 The Hi/lory ofher water with full force, which I bore with verymodeftly, till near an end ; then the made the windfollow with fuch force, as made (as I thought) thevery ftone I leaned upon to move, which made meburft out into laughter ; then up gets the wife, andruns for it; I followed hard after into the houfe,and as I enteied the house I heard the goodman,faying, Ay, ay, goodwife, whatJs the hafte, yourun fo ?No more pafled, until I addrefTed myfelf to thegoodman for quarters; which he anfwered, “ In-deed, lad, we hae nae beds but three, my wifeu and I, ourfells twa, and the twa bits o’ little aner,^ Willie and Jenny lie in ane, the twa lads, ourf* twa fervant men,,Willie Black and Tom lie inu anither, and auld Maggs, my mither, and the lafs,a Jean Tirram, lie thegither, and that fills them** a,.,, O but, fays I, goodman, there is fome ofthem fuller than others, you may let me lie withyour mother and the lafs; I fball lie heads andthraws wi* them, and keep on my breeks A goodkeep me, quo’ the ’af», frae a’ temptations to fin,although thou be but a callar,, heth i'll rather lie wi’Sannock Garner: Hute awa’, qun’ the auki wife, thepoor lad may lie on a battle of ftrae, beyond thefire : No, no, cries the goodwife, he’s no be herethe night, or I’fe no be here : Dear goodwife, (aidI, what ails you at me ?

It*' SiH HS ALI BABA: KX XXOR TUXNNAN INTERESTING TALE.H1MGLASGOW:HHHHNFS1STED FOR T11K 1300ICS FIXERS.4LI BABA:ORTHE FORTY THIEVES.—«=X300<3—In tlie country of Persia, there lived twobrothers, the sons of a poor man; the onewas named Cassim, and the other Ali Baba;Cassim, the elder, married a wife with aconsiderable fortune, and lived at his ease,in a handsome house, with plenty of ser¬vants ; but the wife of Ali Baba was aspoor as himself, they dwelt in a mean cot¬tage in the suburbs of the city, and he main¬tained his family by cutting’ wood in aneighbouring forest.One day when Ali Baba was in the forestand prepared to load his asses with thewood he had cut, he saw a troop of horse¬men approaching towards him. He hadoften heard of robbers who infested thatforest, and in great fright, he hastily climbeda large tree, which stood near the foot of a?cck, and hid hirnself among the branches.The horsemen soon galloped up to therock, where they all dismounted. Ali Babaeounted forty of them, and he could not133doubt, but they were thieves, by their ill-looking countenances. They each took aloaded portmanteau from his horse, and hewho seemed to he their captain, turning tothe rock, said open' sesame, and immediate¬ly a door opened in the rock, and all therobbers passed in, when the door shut of it¬self. In a short time the door openedagain, and the forty robbers came out, fol¬lowed by their captain, who said, shutsesame. The door instantly closed, and thetroop mounting their horses, were presentlyout ^ ‘ 1"time, and seeing that the robbers did notreturn, he ventured down, and approach¬ing close to the rock, said, Open Sesame,immediately the door flew open, and AliBaba beheld a spacious cavern, very light,and filled with all sorts of provisions, mer¬chandise, rich stuffs, and heaps of gold andsilver coin, which these robl>ers had takenfrom merchants and travellers. Ali Babathen went in search of his asses, and hav¬ing brought them to the rock, took as manybags of gold coin as they could carry,and put them on their backs, coveringthem w'ith some loose faggots of wood,and afterwards (not forgeting to say fehutSesame,) he drove his asses back to thecity, and 1 laving unloaded them in theremained in the tree a longistable belonging to his cottage, carriedthe hags into liis house, and spread thegold coin out upon the floor before his wife.His wife delighted with possessing somuch money, wanted to count it, butfinding it would take up too much time,she was resolved to measure it; and run¬ning to the house of Ali Baba’s brother,she entreated him to lend her a small mea¬sure. :» lisd.t yd hawolCassini’s wife was very proud and veryenvious: “ 1 wonder,” said she to herself,“ what sort of grain such poor people canhave to measure; but 1 am determined Iwill And out what they are doing.” So be-•fore she gave the measure, she artfully rub¬bed the bottom with some suet.Away ran Ali Baba’s wife, measured themoney, and. having helped her husband tobury it in the yard, she carried hack themeasure to her brother-in-law’s boose, with¬out perceiving that a piece of gold was leftsticking to the bottom of it.“Fine doings, indeed!” cried Cassim’swife to her husband, after examining themeasure, “ your brother there w ho pretendsto he so very poor, is richer than you are,for he does not count his money, but mea¬sures itCassim hearing these w^r1', and seeingthe piece of gold, grew as envious as hiswife, and hastened to his brother, threatenedto inform the Cadi of his wealth, if ho didnot confess to him how he came by it- AirBaba, without hesitation, told hinj the his¬tory of the robbers, and the secret of thcave, and offered him half his treasure; bthe envious Cassim disdained so poor rresolved to have fifty times more than tliaout of the robbers cave.Accordingly he rose early next i »rning,and set out with ten mules loaded with greatchests. He found the rock easily enoughby Ali Baba's description, and having saidOpen Sesame, he gain'ed admission into thecave: where he found more treasure than he' #even had expected to behold from his bro¬ther’s account of it. He immediately be¬gan to gather bags of gold, and pieces ofrich brocades, all which lie piled close to thedoor; but when he had got together asmuch, or even more than his ten mules couldpossibly carry, and wanted to get out toload them. The thoughts of his wonderfidriches had made him entirely forget the wordwhich caused the door to open. In vain hetried Bame, Fame, Lame, Tatame, and athousand others; the door remained as im¬moveable as the rock itself, notwithstandingCassim kicked and screamed, till he wasready to drop with fatigue and vexation.Presently he heard the sound of horses’ feet,i0which fe*» :'g'hth included to be the robbers,and be trembled iest he should now fail avictim to his thirst of riches.He resolved however to make one effortto escape; and when he heard Sesame pro¬nounced, and saw the door open, he sprungout, but was instantly put to death by theswords of the robbers.The thieves now held a council, but notone of them could possibly guess by whatmeans Cassim had got into the cave. Theysaw the heaps of treasure he had piled, readyto take away, but they did not miss whatAli Baba hiul secured belbre. At length,they agreed to cut Cassim’s body into fourquarters, and hang the pieces within thecave, that it might terrify any one fromfurther attempts, and also determined notto return themselves to the cave, for fearof being watched and discovered.When Cassim’s wife saw night come onand her husband not returned, she becamegreatly alarmed. She watched at her win¬dow till daybreak, and then went to tellAli Baba of her fears. Cassim liad notinformed him of his design of going to thecave, but Ali Baba now hearing of hisjourney thither, did not wait to be desired togo in search of him.He drove his asses to the forest withoutdelay, but was alarmed to see blood nearthe rock; and on entering the care, h«found the body of his unfortunate brothercut to pieces and hung up within the door.It was now to late to save him, but hetook down the quarters, and put them uponone of Ids asses, covering them with fag¬gots of wood, and weeping for the miser¬able end of his brother, he regained the city.The door of his brother’s house was open¬ed by Morgiana, an intelligent faithfulfemale slave, who Ali Baba knew was wor¬thy to he trusted with the secret, he there¬fore delivered the body to Morgiana, andwent himself to impart the sad news toCassim’s wife. The poor woman wassadly afflicted, and reproached herself withher foolish envy and curiosity as beingthe cause of her husband’s death; butAli Baba having convinced her of the ne¬cessity of being very discreet, she checkedher lamentations, and resolved to leaveevery tiling to the management of Mor¬gan i a.Morgiana having washed the body, has¬tened to an apothecary’s and asked inr someparticular medicine, saying it was for hermaster, Cassini, who was dangerously ilkShe took care to spread the report of Cas¬sim’s illness through the neighbourhood,and as they saw Ali Balia and his wife* going daily to the house of tlieir brother8In great affliction, they were not surprisedto hear shortly, that Cassim had died of hisdisorder.The next difficulty was to bury him with¬out discovery, but Morgiana was ready tocontrive a plan for that also. She put onher veil, and went to a distant part of thecity very early in the morning, where shefound a poor cobbler just opening his stall,she put a piece of gold into his hand, andtold him he should have another, if hewould suffer himself to be blindfolded andgo with her, carrying his tools with him.Mustapha the cobbler hesitated at first, butthe gold tempted him, and he consented ;when Morgiana, carefully covering hiseyes, so that he could not see a step ofthe way, led him to Cassim’s house; andtaking him to the room where the body waslying, removed the bandage from bis eyes,and bade him sew the mangled limbs to¬gether.Mustapha obeyed her orders, and havingreceived two pieces of gold, was led blind¬folded the same way back to his stall.Morgiana then covered the body with awinding sheet, sent for the undertaker tomake preparations for the funeral: andCassim was buried with all due solemnitythat very day.Ali iiaba now removed his few goods '9Idami all his gold coin that he had broughtfrom the cavern, to the house of his de¬ceased brother,, of which he took posses¬sion ; and Cassini’s widow received everykind attention both from All Baba and hiswife.After an interval of some months, thetroop of robbers again visited their retreatin the foirest, and were completely astonish-cd to find the body taken away from thesaid the captain, “and shall certainly beundone if we do not adopt speedy mea-ures to prevent our ruin. Which of you,my brave comi-ades, will undertake tosearch out the villian who is in possession ofdur secret ?”One of the boldest of the troop advanc¬ed, and offered himself, and was acceptedon the following conditions: namely, thatif he succeeded in his enterprise, he was tohe made second in command of the troop,hut that if he brought lalse intelligence, heThe hold robber readily agreed h> theconditions: and having disguised him¬self, he proceeded to the city. He arrivedthere about day-break, and found the cob¬bler Mustapha in his stall, which wasalways open before any shop in the town.was immediatly t</ be put to death.10ft Gnod morrow, friend," said the rob¬ber, as he passed the ' stall; u you risel)etiines, old as you are; 1 should thinkyou could scarcely see to work by thislig-ht. ”“ Indeed, sir,” replied the cobbler, “ oldas 1 am I do not want for good eye-sight,as you mast needs believe, when I tell youI sewed a dead body together the otherday where I had not so good a light as Ihave now.”u A dead body! exclaimed the robber,who had thus luckily met the very manwho could give him the information he wasin search of. “ However you do not wishto make me believe, that the people of yourcity do impossible things.”“ I tell you,” said Mustapha, in a loudand angry tone, “ I sewed a dead body to¬gether with my own hands.”“ Then I suppose you can tell me alsowhere you performed this wonderful busi¬ness.”Upon this Mustapha related every par¬ticular of his being led blindfolded to thehouse.“ Well, my friend,” said the robber,“ ’tis a fine story, I confess, but notvery easy to believe: however, if you willconvince me by shewing me the houseyou talk of I will give you four pieces11of gold to make amends for my un¬belief."u I think," said the cobbler, after con¬sidering awhile, “ that if you were to blind¬fold me, I would remember every turning wemade, but with my eyes open 1 am sure Iwould never find it out.”Accordingly the robber covered Musta-J)ha’s eyes with his hankerchief, who lednm through most of the principal streets,and stopping by Cassirn’s door, said “hereit is, 1 went no farther than this house.”The robber immediately marked thedoor with a piece of chalk; and givingMustapha his four pieces of gold, dismissohim.Shortly after the thief and Mustapha hadquitted the door, Morgiana coming frommarket, perceived the little mark of whitechalk on the door; and suspecting some¬thing was wrong, directly marked four doorson one side, and five on the other side of hermaster’s in exactly the same manner, with¬out telling any one of it.The robber meantime rejoined his troopand boasted greatly of his success. Hiscaptain and comrades praised his diligence,and being well armed, they proceeded tothe town in different disguises and inseparate parties of three and four to¬gether.• 12It wa$ agrcetl among them that theywere to meet in ic market place at the duskof the evening, and that the captain andthe robber who had discovered the house,were to go there first, to find out to whomit belonged. Accordingly, being arrived inthe streets, and having a lantern with\hem, they began to examine the doors,and found, to their confusion and astonish¬ment, that ten doors wrere marked exactlyalike. The robber, who was the captain’sguide, could not say one word in explan¬ation of this mystery; and when the dis¬appointed troop got back to the forest, hisenraged companions ordered him to be putto death. tAnother now offered himself upon thesame conditions as the former; and hav¬ing bribed Mustapha, and discovered thehouse he made a mark with dark red chalkupon the door in a part that was not in theleast conspicious, and carefully examinedtire surrounding doors, to be certain that nosuch mark was upon any one of them.lint nothing could escape the pryingeyes of Morgiana, scarcely had the robberdeparted when she discovered the red mark;and getting some red chalk, she markedseven doors on each side precisely in thesame place and in the same manner.The robber, valuing himself higldy upon13the precautions he had taken, triumphantlyconducted his captain to the spot, hut greatindeed was his confusion and dismay, whenhe found it irnpossible to say which, among1fifteen houses marked exactly alike, was theright one. The captain furious with hisdisappointment, returned again with thetroop to the forest; and the second robberwas also condemned to death.The captain having thus lost two of histroop, judged that their hands were moreactive than their heads in such service; andhe resolved to employ no other of them, butto go himself upon the business.Accordingly he repaired to the city, andaddressed himself to the cobbler Mustapha,who for six pieces of gold readily performedthe same service for him as he had done forthe two other strangers, and the captainmuch wiser than his men, did not amusehimself with setting a mark upon the door,but attentively considered the house, counteddie number of its,windows, and passed by itvery often to be certain that he should knowit again.lie then returned to the forest and orderedhis troop to go into the town, and buy nine¬teen mules and thirty-eight large jars, onefull of oil and the rest empty.In two or three days the jars were broughttiiui all tilings in readiness, and the captaiu14having put a man into each jar, properlyarmed, the jars heing rubbed on the outsidewith oil, and the covers having holes boredin them for the men to breathe through,oaded his nudes, and in the habit of an oilmerchant, entered the town in the dusk o/;the evening. He proceeded to the streetwhere Ali Baba dwelt, and found him sittingin the porch of his house. u Sir,” said heto Ali Baba, 111 have brought this oil agreat way to sell, and I am too late for thisday’s market, as I am a stranger in thistown, will you do me the favour to let meput my mides into your court-yard, anddirect me where I may lodge to night.Ali Baba, who was a good natural man,welcomed the pretended oil merchant verykindly, and offered him a bed in his ownhouse; and having ordered the mules to beunloaded in the yard, and properly fed, hoinvited his guest into supper. The captainhaving seen the jars placed ready in thayard, followed Ali Baba into the house, andifter supper, was shewn to the chamber whereiC was to sleep.It happened that Morgiana was obligedjo sit up later that night thin usual, to getready her master’s bathing linen for thefollowing morning; and while she was busyalxmt the fire, her lamp went out, and therewas no more oil in the house.Id15After considering what she could possiblyo for a light, she recollected the thirty-iight jars in the yard, and determined tolake a little oil out of one of them for heramp. She took her oil-pot in her hand,.nd approaching the first jar, the robberrithin said, “Is it time captain?” Anyither slave, perhaps, on hearing a man inin oil jar, would have screamed out; huthe prudent Morgiana instantly recollectedlerself and replied softly, No, not yet, lietill till I call you. She passed on to eachf the jars, receiving the same question andgiving the same answer, till she arrived athe last, which was full of oil.Morgiana was now convinced that thisvas a plot of the robbers to murder herraster Ali Baba; so she ran back to thedtchen, and brought out a large kettle,jvhich she filled with oil, and set it on aweat wood fire; and as soon as it l)oiled,ihe went and poured into the jars sufficientif the boiling oil to kill every man withinhem.Having done this, she put out her firemd lamp, and crept softly to her chamber.The captain of the robbers hearing everyfiling quiet in the house, and perceiving nojight any where, arose and went down intodie yard to assemble his men. Coming ftlike first jar, he felt the steams of the boil16oil; he ran hastily to the rest, and tixilevery one of his troop put to death in ijsame manner. Full of rag-e and despair!having failed in his design, he forced «lock of a door that led to a garden, and maxhis escape over the walls.On the following morning, Morgiajrelated to her master Ali Baba his wond'ful deliverance from the pretended oil mcliant and his gang of robbers. Ali Baat first could scarcely credit her tale;when he saw the robbers dead in the jahe could not sufficiently praise her couraand sagacity; and without letting any oelse into the secret, he and Morgiana, tinext night, buried the thirty-seven thievin a deep trench at the Iwttom of the gaden. The jars and the mides as he had ruse for them, were sent from time to tinto the diflerent markets and sold.While Ali Baba took these measuresprevent the public from knowing how 1came by his riches in so short a time, tfcaptain of the forty robbers returned ithe forest, in most inconceivable mortiffition ; and in the agitation, or ratherfusion, he was in at his success, soconfrar|to what he had promised himself, he entthe cave, not being able, all the way froithe town, to come to any resolution what tdo to Ali Baba.17The loneliness of the dark place seemedightful to him. Where are you, my braveids, cried he, old companions of my watch-ig-s, inroads, and labour? What can I do: ithout you ? Did I collect you to lose youy so base a fate, and so unworthy yourhurage? Had you died with your sabresi your hands, like brave men, my regretd been less! When shall I get so gal-nt a troop again ? And if I could, can Iidertake it without exposing so muchold and treasure to him, who hath alreadyriched himself out of it? I cannot, Iight not to think of it, before I have takenway his life. 1 will undertake that my-df, which 1 could not accomplish with soowerM assistance : and when I have takenare to secure this treasure from being pil-iged, I will provide for it new masters andaccessors after me, who shall preserve andugment it to all posterity. This resolutioneing taken, he was not at a loss how toxecute it; but, easy in his mind, andall of hopes, he slept all that night veryuietlv.When he waked early next morning as!ie had proposed, he dressed himself, agree-ply to the project he had in his head, andvent to the town, and took a lodging in achan. And as he expected what had hap¬pened at Ali Baba’s might make a greatILnoise in tiie town, he asked liL< host, by waof discourse, what news there were in the ciWUpon which the innkeeper told him a grelmany thing's, which did not concern him ijthe least. H e j udged by this, that the reasowhy Ali Baba kept this affair so secret wafor fear people should know where the treasure lay, and the means of coming at itand because he knew his life would be soughupon account of it. And this urged hithe more to neglect nothing to rid himsel|of so dangerous a personThe next thing that the captain haddo was to provide himself with a horse, bconvey a great many sorts of rich stuffs anfine linen to his lodging, which he did ba great many journeys to the forest, buwith all the necessary precautions imaginable to conceal the place whence he brouglthem. In order to dispose of the merchandizes, when he had amassed them togetherhe took a furnished shop, which happeneto be opposite to that which was Cassirms,which Ali Baba’s son had not long occu¬pied.He took upon him the name of CogiaHoussain, and as a new comer, was, accord¬ing to custom, extremely civil and complai¬sant to all the merchants his neighboursAnd as Ali Baba’s son was young and|handsome, and a man of good sense, andwas often obliged to converse with CogiaHoussain, he soon made them acquaintedwith him. He strove to cultivate his friend¬ship, more particularly when, two or threedays after he was settled, he recognized AliBaba, who came to see his son, and stoppedto talk with him as he was accustomed to do;and when he was gone, he learnt from hisson who he was. He increased his assidu¬ities, caressed him after the most engagingmanner, made him some small presents,and often asked him to dine and sup withhim : and treated him very handsomely.Ali Baba’s son did not care to lie undersuch obligation to Cogia Houssian withoutmakinof the like return ; but was so muchstraitened for want of room in his house,that he could not entertain him so well ashe wished: and therefore acquainted hisfather Ali Baha with his intention, and toldhim that it did not look well for him to re¬ceive such favours from Cogia Houssain.. thout inviting him again.Ali Baba, with great pleasure, took theI treat upon himself. Son, said he, to-morrow1 (Friday) which is a day that the shops of. such great merchants as Cogia Houssian; and yourself are shut, get him to take a’ walk with you after dinner, and as you( come back, pass by my door, and call in:[ It will look better to have it happen accident-20ally, than if you gave him a formal invitation.I will go and order Morgiana to provide a sup¬per.The next day, after dinner, Ali Baba’s sonand Cogia Houssian met by appointment, andtook thejr walk, and as they returned, Ali Ba¬ba’s son led Cogia Houssian through the streetwhere his father lived; and when they came tothe house, he stopped and knocked at the door.This, sir, said he, is my father’s house; who,upon the account I have given him of yourfriendship, charged me to procure him thehonour of your acquaintance: and I desire youto add this pleasure to those 1 am already indebted toyou for.The artful Cogia Houseian would not too hasti¬ly accept this invitation, but pretended he wasnot fond of going into company, and that he hadbusiness which demanded his presence at home.These excuses only made Ali Baba’s son themoj-e engor to take him to bis father’s bouse, andafter repeated solicitations, the merchant con¬sented to sup at Ali Baba’s the following even¬ing.A most excellent supper was provided, which Mor¬giana cooked in her best manner, as was her usualcustom, she carried in the first dish herself. Themoment she looked at Cogia Houssian, she knew himto be the pretendedoil-merchant. The prudent Mor-2!iana did not say a word to any one of thisiscovery, hut sent the other slave into theitchen, and waited at table herself; andbite Coma Houssian was drinking, shfsrceived he had a dagger under his coat.^hen sujtper was ende<l; and the desertnd wines on the table, Morgiana went awaynd dressed herself in the habit of a dancingirl: she next called Abdalla, a faith lidave, to play on his talior while she danced.As soon as she appeared at the parlouroor, her master, who was very fond of see-ig her dance, ordered her to come in andatertain the guest with some of her bestlincing. Cogia Houssian was not verydl satisfied with this cnt'"V?ninent, butas compelled, for fear of discovering him-lf, to seem pleased v.ai the dancing, whilej fact he wished Morgiana ‘ the devil, andis quite alarmed le.^ he ..ouhl ioze hiportunity of murdering P-ba a hitn’Morgiana danced several dances with thimost grace and agility; and ^awg a poinard from her girdle, she performimany surprising things with it, sometimesesenting the point to one, then at another,d then seeming to strike it into her ownsom. Suddenly she paused, and holding} poinard in the right hand, held her lefther master, as if begging some money;22 jupon which All Baha and his son eadi gaher a small piece of money. She thiturned to the pretended Cogia Houssic'|and when he was putting his hand into |purse, she plunged the poinard intoheart.Ali Baha and his son, frightened at taction, cried out aloud. Unhappy wretcexclaimed Ali Baba, what have you d<|to ruin me and my family? It was to pserve you, not to ruin you, answered Mgiana; fiir see here said she (opening CoHoussian’s garment, and shewing the difer), what an enemy you had entertaim,ook vr-xl at him, and you will find him t<|ith the pretended oil merchant, and Icaptain of the gang of forty robbers : rwhat would you have more to persuade jof his wicked design ? Before I saw hiI suspected him as soon as you told me Ihad such a guest. I saw him, and |find th my suspicion was not grouijessAli Baba, who immediately felt thejgation he had to Morgiana for savis life a second time, embraced her: M-iana, said he, 1 gave you your libeiand then promised you that my gratitshould not stop there, but that I would scomplete it. The time is come for mt||give you a proof of it, by making you23daughter-in-law. Then addressing1 himselfto his son, he said to him, I believe you,son, to be so dutiful a child, that you willnot refuse Morgiana for your wife. Yousee that Cogia Houssian sought your friend¬ship with a treacherous design to take awaymy life; and, if he had succeeded, there isno doubt but he would have sacriiiced youalso to his revenge. Consider, that bymarrying Morgiana, you marry the supportof my family, and your ow n.The son, far from shewing any dislike,readily consented to the marriage; not onlybecause he would not disobey his father, butthat his inclination prompted him to it.After this, they thought of burying thecaptain of the robbers with his comrades,and did it so privately that nobody knewany thing of it till a great many yearsafter, when not any one had any concernn the publication of tins remarkable his-oiy.A few days afterwards, Ali Baoa cele¬brated the marriage of his son and Morgiana,|ath a sumptuous entertainment; and everyline who knew Morgiana, said she wasworthy of her good fortune, and highlyijommended her master’s generosity towards•ier.During a twelve-month Ali Baba forboreo go near the forest, but at length hiscuriosity excited him to make another jour¬ney. When he came to the cave, he sav»110“ footsteps of either men or horses; amhaving- said Open Sesame, he went in, amjudged by the state of tilings deposited iythe cavern, that no one had been there sinothe pretended Cogia Houssian had rernoyeithe merchandise to his shop, in ihe cityAli Baba took as much gold home as hihorse could carry; and afterwards he carrielhis son to the cave, and taught him thsecret. This secret they handed down ttheir posterity, and, using their good fortunwith moderation, they lived in honour ansplendour, and served with dignity some cthe highest offices of the state.

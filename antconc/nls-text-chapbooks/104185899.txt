\o. 2.THEFACTOR'S GARLAND.FART I.Behold here’s a ditty, the truth and uo jest.Concerning a young gentleman in the east,’Who, by his great gaming, came to poverty,And afterwards went many a voyage to sea.Being well educate, and one of great wit,Three merchants in London they all thought it fit ‘.To make him their Captain and Factor also,And for them to Turkey a voyage he did go.And walking along the streets there he found,A poor dead man’s carcase lying on the ground,lie asked the reason why he there did lie,Then one of the natives did make this reply :—That man was a Christian while he drew breath.The duty’s unpaid, he lies above the earth.Why, what are the duties? the Factor he criedpIt is fifty pounds, sir, the Turk he replied,That is a great sum, quoth the Factor, indeed!But to see him He there makes my heart for to bleed ;So then by the Factor the money was paid,And uuder the earth the dead carcase was laid.9When having gone further, by chance he did spy,A beautiful creature just going to die,A young ■waiting-maid, who strangled must be,For nothing but striking a Turkish lady.To think of her dying, with dread he was fill’d.Then rivers of tears, like waters distill’d.Like streams of a fountain, from her eyes ran downHer red rosy cheeks, and from thence to the ground.Hearing what her crime was, he, to end the strife,Said, What must I give for this poor creature’s life ?The answer was turned, an hundred pound.The which for her pardon he freely paid down.He said. Fairest creature, thy weeping refrain,And be of good comfort, thou shalt not be slain ;Beliold, I have purchas’d thy pardon, will yeBe willing to go to fair England with me ?She said, Sir, I thank you, who freed me from death,I’m bound to obey you so long’s I have breath.And if you are willing, to fair England I’ll go,And due respect to you till death I will show.PART II.He brought her to London, and there it is said,He set up housekeeping, and made her his maidFor to wait upon him, and finding her just,With the keys of his riches he did her entrust.At last this young Factor was hired once more,To cross the proud waves and billows that roar ;And into that country his course was to steer.Which by this maid’s father was govern’d we hear.Being a hot country, this maid did prepareTo get fine light robes in that country to wear,He bought a silk waist-coat, the which it is toldHis servant maid flowered with silver and gold.She said to him, Master, I do understand.You are going Factor unto such a land ;And if you that Prince’s court enter in,Be sure let this fine flowered garment be seen.He said, to that Prince’s court I must go,The meaning of your words I long for to know,Sir I will not tell you, some reason you’ll find,With that he replied, I’ll fulfill thy mind.Then away he sailed, and came to the shore,This Factor he came to the Emperor’s door ;For it was the usual custom of that place,To present some noble gifts unto his grace.His gift was accepted, and as he stood by,On his flowered garment the Prince cast an eye,Which made him colour, and thus he did say,Who flowered that garment ? Now tell me I pray.If it please your Grace my last voyage was to TurkeyWhere I saw a creature that strangled must beAnd to save her life, gave an hundred pounds,And carried her with me to fair London town.There she’s my housekeeper while I'm in this land :And when of my coming she did understand,She flowered this robe, and gave strict charge to meTo let it be seen by your Majesty.The prince cried, Behold! friends, this robe which IIs of the same flower and spot I do swear, [wear4%Thy maid wrought them both, she’s my daughter dear,I have not heard from her till now these three year.To pay a visit to some neighbouring princeI sent her in ship, and have ne’er seen her since ;And I was afraid the sea had proved her grave,But I heard to Turkey she was taken a slave.For the loss of my child, who I thought was kill’d,A well full of tears in my court has been spill’d ;My princess, her mother, could for her not rest.Her loss drew millions of sighs from her breast.Thy ship shall he richly loaded with speed.And I’ll send a ship for her convoy indeed ;Because of thy love, thou sav’d my child’s life.Bring her alive to me, I’ll make her thy wife :And if thou should’st not live to bring her to me,Whoe’er brings her home bis bride she shall be ;And twenty thousand a year you shall have,That ventur’d my dear child’s life for to save.The ship being loaded, their anchor was weighing,And ho with his convoy came over the main.To fair London city, and home he did go,And gave this young princess these tickings to know.PART III.He said, Noble lady, 1 have good news to tell,The old prince, your father, and mother’s both well,And your royal parents this thing have design’d,In the bond of wedlock we both should be join’d ;Perhaps, noble lady, you would not agree,To marry a poor man, especially me.5Sir, were you a beegar, I would be your wife,Because, wJVen just dying, you sawed my life.I ne’er .-hall forget that token of love,Of all men living I prize thee above ;Since it is so ordered, I’m well pleased I vow,And glad my dear father these things do allow ;Bray sell off your goods that you have on store.And give all your money to those that are poor.And let us be jogging with speed e’er the main.For 1 Long to see my dear parents again.This tiling was soon done, and they sailed awayIn the- ship that her father sent for her convoy :But mark what was acted on the ocean wide.To deprive the Factor of his royal bride.The Captain who conveyed them over the deepOne night as the Factor was la^id in Iris sleep.Being under sail, over-board did him throw.Saying, now I shall have this young creature I know.There happ’ned to be a small island at hand,To which the Factor swam as I understand ;And there I shall leave him a while for to mourn.And unto the ship again will return.Next morning, as soon as daylight did peep,He wak’d the young princess out of her sleep,And saitl. Noble lady, the Factor’s not here,He’s fall’n overboard and drowned I fear.To bear the sad. news, then her eyes they did flow':He said. Noble lady, since now it is so.There’s none here can help it, do not troubled be.For thou in short space veur dear parents shall see.GAnd when that they came to the desired port,This princess came weeping to her father’s court,Who gladly received her with joy and great mirth, jSaying, where is the man that freed you from deathThe captain replied, As he lay asleep,He fell overboard, and was drowned in the deep ;Your Grace said, the man your child home should bringWould have her, I hope you’ll perform this thing.Yes, that was my promise, the Monarch replied ;What say’st thou, daughter, wilt thou be his bride ? :She said, Yes, dear father, but first, if you please,For him that sav’d my life I’ll mourn forty days.Then into close mourning this Lady she went,For the loss of her good friend, in tears to lament.And there I will leave her in tears for a while,And turn to the Factor who was left on the Isle.PART IV.In this desert Island the Factor he lay,In floods of tears weeping two nights and a day!At length on the ocean appear’d to his view,A little old man paddling in a canoe.The Factor call'd to him, which caus’d him to stay,And drawing near to him, the old man he did say,Friend how cam’st thou hither ? with eyes that did flow,He told him the secret and where he would go.The old man said to him, If there thou dost lie,With grief and great hunger in short thou wilt die.What wilt thou give me, to that court I’ll thee guide,I have nothing to give you, the Factor replied.' thou wilt promise, and be true to me,o give me the first babe that is born to thee,rhen thirty months old, to that court I’ll thee bring,will not release thee without that very thing.he Factor consider’d that thing would cause grief,pd without it for him there was no relief,ie cried, Life is sweet, and my life for to save,wry me to that place, and your will you shall have.) soon’s he was carried to the court, and when!e came to the gates, he saw his lady then,ooking out of her window, who seeing him there,rom sorrow transported to joy they were.e unto the court then with joy was receiv’d,’here his lady met him, who for him had griev’d,nd said, My dear jewel, my joy, and my dear,! where have you tarried ?

Robertson, No. 4, Horfe Wynd.1797.O P THEVIS.Nations falling, the' Islands fleeing away, andTHOUGHTS,EVENTS & APPEARANCESPRESENT TIMES, i£c.You have, I hear, defired I fliouldfend you the pamphlet, entitled The Signs ofthe Times ; It is not at hand with me at pre-fent, but you will foon find it in Edin¬burgh.Though I think I have never wrote you be¬fore, your enquiry about the obfervers of thetimes, givfes me to hope, that your mind isnot altogether enchanted uuth the charms ofGrecian and Roman poets, fages, and ora¬tors, which, however much their fublimethoughts and flowery ftile enlarge the ge¬nius, exalt the fpeech, and accomplilh youto fpeak in public, ftill confider, that thetrue ftudy of the heart fliould be, acquaint-A- 2C 4 )ance with God, bis works of creation andprovidence, comparing them with his holyoracles, by which the mind will come to fee,that the events of the times are only fulfil¬ling what he hath already foretold, and all thefigns or fignals that are hanging out to attradlthe enquiry of mankind in public appear¬ances, have their true motto in facred write.Whatever Deifts, or the unthinking partof mankind, may alledge othervvife, by a juftacquaintance, and continued examination ofGod’s word and works, the Chriftian will ac¬quire a pleafure and compofure of heart, a-midft the reeling confuiion of events whichperplex and torment the unthinking world,and even diftracft the grovelling fenfualift.The author of “ The Signs of the Times,”has given many wonderful and infiructiveproofs of his having compared prefent events,accomplifhed and accomplifhing, with theword of God, and the connection he thewsappear very finking. In reading his views,my attention was awakened to confider, whatevents at prefent appeared fulfilling particu¬lar parts of the Revelation of the New Tef-( 5 )tament, and have been led to mark the fol¬lowing obfervations, which, I could wifri you,and all who read or hear the word of God, toconfider. As I have never feen any of themin print, I fhall begin withREVELATION, xvi. 17.Where you will obferve it written, thatthe feventh angel poured out his vial intothe air, when a great voice came out of thetemple in heaven, faying, “ It is done,” whichI take to be, the reign of Antichrift is at anend, the oppreflion of the true church is at.an end.This is followed- in the 18th verfe,with voices, and thunders, and lightnings,which, I take, to relate to the cries and plead¬ings againft popery and abfolute powerthroughout Europe, and efpecially in France,before the late Revolution; and the thun-derings and lightnings to be the ftrugglesand battles with fire-arms, bringing aboutand accomplilhing that great earthquake orrevolution, which in many circumftances,excels all other Ihakings or commotions thathave been fince mankind were upon earth.C 6 ),, If an intelligent mind confider what prin¬ciples of civil and religious power are over¬turned by it, I mean defpotifm and fuper-llition ; how long thele had endured, howftrong they were fupported, and how danger¬ous it was to oppofe them, they will beclearly convinced, as it is faid, that the likenever happened before in any country.In the 19th verfe, the great city is faid to bedivided into three parts. The great cityhere fpoken of, appears to me to be no otherthan the whole eftablifhed Roman church, asthe true church is often compared to a city,and the metaphor is very exprellive, as thelearned have obferved, and a falfe church in. this has the fame metaphor of the true, as thechurch of Rome in this book it is often cal¬led, a city appearing in all its eftablilhed ex¬tent, as fupported and confirmed by law.Before the French revolution, popery ap¬pears in the conne&ion of the countrieswhere it w^as firft eflablifhed by law, as anunited body or city. View in the map ofEurope, the connexion of the popifh coun¬tries, from the borders of Ruffia and Tur-A 3key to Cape St. Vincent, and one may feethem all joined lefs or more; but, even inthe map, if France and French conquefts,are cut out, the countries where popery is atprefent eftablilhed will fall into three pieces,viz. Spain and Portugal on the weft, Rome,Naples, and the States of Italy on the foutb,Germany, Hungary, and Poland on thenorth and eaft; this fulfils very evidentlythe firft fentence of the 19th verfe.In the next fentence, it is faid, “ and“ the cities of the nations fell"thefecities of the nations, I take alfo to bechurches, or what is called the eftablifh-ed churches, one of thefe the moft appa¬rently agreeable to fcripture of any othereftabliftied church. In Europe it is alreadyfallen, I mean in the prelbyterian church inHolland ; as I have always thought prefby-tery neareft to chriftiah fimplicity. In A-merica, religious eftablilhments are alfo abo-liflied.An eftabliftied church, in many cir-cumftances and conliderations, appears ra¬ther to be a city of the nations than the trueC 8 )church of Chrift ; becaufe, the holy commu¬nion of the eflablifhed churches, are moreconformed to the fpirit and principles ofthe nation, than the fpiric of grace and theAmple principles ofchriftianity. Teachers andpaftors are admitted into the churches efta-blidied by law, by the leading powers of thenations, and according to the rules of nation¬al policy, and not called by the flock ofChrift, as the only judges who know hisvoice and will not follow ftrangers. Theminifters in eftablilhed churches are fupport-ed by the nations and not by the milk of thechriftian flock; though the labourers have alegal right to their hire, yet I fee no otherreafon for any gofpel minifter havingan efta¬blilhed tiend, or falary, but a greed of filthylucre.To fpeak of tiends is Jewilh, where aa whole tribe, or twelve, were employed ; inthe chriflian difpenfation all is plain and fim-ple ; one perfon in proper conveniency mayteach and adminifter all the gofpel ordinan¬ces to one thoufand, at leaft ; three or fivehundred can come to one minifter, how un¬juft, that he Ihould live to the tenth incotneC 9 )of all thefe. Befides, Chrift Jefus whofekingdom is not of this world, hath ftronglyenjoined, that his ambafiadors excel only infpiritual accomplifhments, and not in carnalIhow. I have feen in my fmall acquaintancewith the world, that as riches and grandeurincreafed, felf fenfuality and pride came in¬to dominion, both in hearts and families,while felf-denial, humility, and chriftian cha¬rity, were fcarce refpe&ed, and duty becamethe fervant of tafte. How unlike the greatAuthor of chriflianity are his ambafladors!What difference can we behold in a gen¬tleman of the church and thofe of the na¬tion ? In thefe and many other refpe&s, ifroom and time would permit to fliow, efta-blifhed churches appear to be the cities ofthe nations here alluded to by the apaftle ; Imay add, all circumftances confidered, thereare evidences that the effablifhed churchesin Britain and Ireland cannot fland long.The common people, who like fmall Honesin a building, fupport and connedt the great,are falling into diffenting parties, where theyfind the dodtrine and exercifes of chriftianitymore lively, and the government more fcrip-tural. The eflabliflied clergy are ftill be-( 1° )coming more proud, ignorant, lifelefs, andfenfual, which being contrary to chriftianity,cannot mifs to bring down any fabric raifcdto fupport it. Befides, many of the greatand leading men in the nation look uponreligion as nothing, only as far as fubfervientto civil intereft; and are beginning to thinkthe burden of fupporting thefe cities of the na¬tions far greater than all the benefit they pro¬duce to fociety. So they, viz. the eftablilhedchurches, I mean fo far as relates to tempo¬rals, are more fnpported by the views of ru¬lers than the rules of Chrift. Whenever theyfee their infignificancy and forfake them,then they mud: fall, while the true churchof Chrift (hall ftand firm on himfelf, as its in¬fallible rock ; this is the holy city, the newJerufalem, which fhall more clearly appear,when the cities of the nations are fallen, asthey did before they were built; and, thoughI believe many citizens of the new Jerufa¬lem hath dwelt in eftablilhed churches, thofecities of the nations, and been employed andprivileged by them, yet they found manyembarrafiments to pleafe the King of Zion,and the kings of the nations; they faw how.impoffible it was to pleafe God and Mam¬mon.The laft fentence of this 19th verfe, afterIhewing the great city divided into threeparts, and the cities of the nations falling,brings in great Babylon thus divided, to re¬ceive the cup of the wine of the fiercenefs ofthe wrath of God. We are facredly inform¬ed, that divifion tends to defolation ; all thefupporters of myftical Babylon muft furelybe tormented, to fee their city divided,their wealth plundered, and themfelves ab¬horred.Again, the 20th verfe feems remarkablyto point at the ifles of Britain and Ireland.The firft fentence fays, “ And every ifland‘‘ fled aw^y.” All agree that the prophe¬cies of this book of the Revelation relatesparticularly to Chriflendom and Europe;more efpecially as Britain and Ireland arethe mofl: exalted, brge, and confpicuousiflands in Europe, and tbe mofl; powerfuland wealthy iflands in Chriftendom. As totheir fleeing away, I am incapable to def-cribe grammatical criticifms, but I take it to*( 12 )denote their rulers or inhabitants being over¬come, in a caufe to which thej had engag¬ed their whole power, wifdom and wealth,and as a difcomfited army flying back. Howfar this obfervation correfponds with prefentevents and appearances, let the intelligentobferver confider.Again, the apoftle in the lafl: fentence ofthe fame 20th verfe, informs us, by his hie-roglyfic figures, that when every ifland fledaway the mountains were not found. Bymountains I think may naturally be meant,men either of high and rifing principles, orpowers, or both, whether in church or ftate,but very cold and barren, as to public bene¬fit to fociety; thefe lhall either lofe theirhaughty fpirit or power, and fo be renderedunnoticeable. Leaving thefe general hintsand obfervations on the xviii chapter, to yourimprovement, and fuch as may read them, Ifliall next write you my thoughts onCHAPTER xx. Verse i.Where the apoflle appears, as obfervingin vifion, an angel coming down from hea-ven, having the key of the bottorriids pitand a great chain in his hand. This angelJ view, as lome fpiritual light, coming intothe hearts or minds of mankind, (hewingthem the boltomlefs pit of deep deceit, bywhich they have been kept in civil and reli¬gious bondage and darknefs. This greatchain, appears to me to intimate fome greatunion among the lower clafles, particularlyin France ; as chains for binding, not for or¬nament, are made of common and coarfermetals, fo the lower callings and occupations,uniting by the fame angelic light, becomelike a chain to bind what really doth or mayfeem to hurt or deftroy them.In the 2d verfe, the ufe of this chain is e-videnced; where it is faid, that he laid holdon the dragon, that old ferpenr, the deviland fatan, and bound .him a thoufand years.This, I think, is to limit evil powers, princi¬ples, and practices that have been perniciousto mankind, hurting and deftroying themand their privileges, by fury and cruelty.Like the dragon, deceiving them by fubtile-ty; like the ferpent, in poifoning their mindsand fenfes. The fpiritual evils, reprefented( *4 )by thefe names of dragon, old ferpent, deviland fatan, being difcovered, bound, and im-prifoned by the agreeable connexion andprudence of all orders of mankind, fball nothave the liberty to adi the part they haveformerly done, according to the rules of thepowers of darknefs ; but all degrees of menforfaking proud and felfiih principles, fliallflrive who (hall become mod eitcniively ufe-ful, and bed ferve each other, feeking thegood of the whole, (hall find mod good tothemfelves. By fuch wifdom and power asthis, the powers of darknefs appear to bebound and fealed up in their own dungeon,for an appointed feafon, which appears be¬ginning in the prefent and henceforth aera;1 am perfwaded that the real principles ofmoral evil will become fo clear, that lawsnot formed to bind it up, both in civil andreligious concerns, will become unpopularand fo be repalled. Rulers that rule not forthe univerfal good, but to ferve their prideand carnal pleafure, will be defpifed and re¬moved, and fuch as appear to be mod fer-viceable will be mod edeemed, as our blelf-ed Saviour told his difciples, “ Whoever“ would be greated among you, let him (hew( i5 )“ himfelf moft ferviceable.” In tiiis obfer-vance of his maxims, will the glory of thelatter days, or the reign of our Saviour, moltappear.In the 5th verfe, the apodle in the famevifion, informs us, that he faw thrones, andthey that fat upon them ; and judgmentwas given unto them. It hath flruck me,that much of the events in France, are ful¬filling what is foretold in the book of the Re¬velation, by the apodle John. Whetherthefe words in the vifion, may refer to theDirectory eilablifhed in France by their newconditution or not, I fhall not afcertain ; on¬ly they are here faid to be thrones in theplural number, fo are the Directory’s feats.And a plurality are faid to fit on them, theyare not faid to make laws, but as it were toexecute the laws that are in being : judg¬ment is here faid to be given then.What I have already confidered, I taketo be fulfilled, in events that relate to thecarnal and civil concerns of mankind. Butnow the apoftle appears, in the fecond fen-tence of this 2d verfe, to behold fpiritual glo-B 2( 16 )ries fpringing up, related in the figure, a re-lurredion of the fouls of the martyrs; whichcan only imply the true life and knowledgeof chriftianity, according to the holy fcrip-tures, and a converfation of holy fincerityand fimplicity, -quite free from and oppofiteto popery. Neither worfhipping the bead,in profeffing popery by a mark on the fore¬head, nor his image in whatever form it mayappear among proteftants, fuch as the poli¬tical unfcriptural worfhip and government ofvarious parties.On their reftrained communion and rea-dinefs to excommunicate ; their fuperfiitiousregard to ceremonies and authority of formerperfons, or church counfel; or even in per-fonal felf-conceit, cenforioufnefs, and cruelperfecuting defires ; nor receiving the markof popery in their right hand, by giving ei¬ther power or property to affift and fupportthe beafi, or his image. Thofe that are di¬rected by fuch a fpirit, are equal in heart tomartyrs; are joined to the Lord, and will bemore refpeCted by the true church thanthofe that excel them in every other accom-plifhment of more natural wifdoni. CarnalC 17 )ciergymen and carelefs profeflbrs, as well asinfidels, have had no right feeling of this re¬ceiving fpirit; they are void of thofe exalt¬ing principles that lead to reign with Ghrifi.The events that feem to be coming for¬ward, incline me to conclude, that rulingprinciples, everv refpefling this wotld, willchange fides. From what hath been.felt informer ages both by Jews, heathens, andchriftians, w hoever fought moll the welfare ofmankind, have been moll wickedly perfe-cuted and dellroyed by them. Whoeverappeared to excel in virtue or holinefs, be¬came the butt of maliee; as the hi (lory of e-very age will verify. Eut it appears, in thislafl age or millenium, perfons will becomepopular as the experience of their ufefulnefsfliall recommend them, and will lofe theirinfluence when they lofe their virtue, andthofe will be fet by themfdvcs whofe narrowmind feek only felf.I think, it therefore needful, to advife theyoung, and efpecially young fludents whoare purfuing their learning at an univerfity,to drive, not for thefe excellencies which' B 3( 18 )pleafe the carnal fancy, but how they fiiallobtain and be enabled to recomment themod pure and durable knowledge. Everydevote mind may raife his gratitude, andblefs God, that the mift of popery no moredarkens the country; that we fee the holyoracles fulfilled in the riling and falling ofthe great Antichrift; all the dazzling glareof that adorned whore, in the moral world,is now finking in the fea of divine judg¬ments, and fliall arife no more : And youngUndents, inftead of looking forward to all theindulging ple-afures of fome emolument a-mong eftablifhed churches, or becoming no¬ticed by the rulers of the nation, fliould fettheir eye to fpread the true knowledge ofreligion, among Jews, papifts, Mahometans,and pagans; fliould fearch the feriptures forthe true knowledge of the glorious excellen¬cies of redeeming love, and to feel the powerof the glad tidings of peace on earth andgood-will towards men; rejoicing that Godis in Chrift reconciling the world to himfelf,and not imputing their trefpafics unto them.The blefled tendernefs of confcience, ac¬cording to God’s word, I foon hope will be( 19 )no more burdened by teds of party; where ¬by men on pretence of covenanting withGod, I am afraid, are only driving to con¬firm and collect profelytes to names anddictin&ions. The church of Chrift will ap¬pear mod beautiful when dript of all that isedeemed among men, which is an abomina¬tion in the fight of God.The courfe of a few years hath producedgreat things, and great events feem neartheir birth. When the chridian fees thecarnal world in perplexity, he' needs not betroubled amidd thefe alarms. In their pa¬tience, let thole who trud in God throughthe Saviour, poflefs their fouls and lift upheads, for their redemption draweth nigh.But, let the carnal clergymen tremble, whohave in a lordly manner, oppreffed the heri¬tage of the Lord, broken in pieces his peo¬ple, and offended his little ones, becaufe theyhad the civil power on their fide. How willyou appear, when your cities fall, and thenations fhake you4pff wiiSi abhorrence, andChrid Jefus the true head of the churchhimfelf, whofe commiflion you have defpif-ed, in not afiiding to the utmod, to have the( 20 )gofpel preached to every creature, fo thatJews and heathens might hear the joyfulfound ? Remember, if grace be not given toyou who will not help to make it known a-mong pagan tribes, greater and more end'lefs mifery is coming upon you the profefiedchriftian leaders, than the molt wretched in¬fidel among Jews, pagans, or Mahometans.Let every fincere believer look and watchwith prayer, for his great Lord coming, whohath all power in heaven and in earth, whowill purge his fandihiary wbth the fpirit ofjudgment, and with the fpirit of burning,and take out of his church and from amonghi5 people every thing that offends, whenall the vefifels of the church fhall be holyyea, holinefs fhall be engraven on the verybells of the bories in the new Jerufalem, andthere fhall be nothing to hurt, far lefs to def-troy, in all God’s holy mountain.The eftablifhed clergy appear at prefent,apprehenfive their cities are in great danger;looking with jealoufy upon thofe falling a-feroad, they more vehemently than any otherdifcription of men, cry out againft the crimesof Franceand the danger of Frencl>principles.Strange, that fuch as condemned the errorsof popery, fhould now make it the moft hei¬nous evil to overturn it, the reafon is obvious;the axe is levelling at the root of ecclefiafticaleftablifhments, and all the nefts that are builtupon the branches are trembling, which can¬not mifs to raife a great noice. and hurry a-mong the well-feathered inhabitants, whohave dwelt with eafe upon it. Rejoice overher ye followers of Chrift, and efpecially hisminifters, when God’s judgments are madeknown upon Babylon, come out from her andreform from her lins, leaft her plagues over¬take you, which I fear will reach fome ofGod’s people, who have not the prudence toforce the evil and avoid it, but pafs on infimplicity and fo be punilhed.Though I rejoice in the overthrow of po¬pery and the irtcreafe of liberty, let none takeme as an advocate for the crimes of France.! The infidelity, fabbath-breakmg, violations ofj property, and other cruel outrages, are hein¬ous evils in the fight of God and every feriousdifcei'ning mind ; but all circumdances con-lidered, France can be more excufed than. we. Are not infidels readier to receive the( 22 )true faith than felf-conceited Arminians? Is itto be thoughtcriminallv ftrange, that a nationlong over-burdenedvvithfuperftitious holidays,Ihould in ignorant hurry and anger, ftiake offthe appointed times of Divine worfhip withthofe of human device. But, I fear if theFrench were to turn the reproach againftmany of us who are moft forward to criminatethem, what a formal fhame would many ofpur church-femces appear; and our fabbathsonly a day of unmeaning idlenefs and carnalentertainment if not immoral exercife. Letus be thankful to God, fmall appearance ofnational cruelty hath for a long time appear¬ed at home ; but cafting our eyes abroad andviewing, W'hat a cruel time of flave-trade wehave authorifed ! what wars we have kindledand continued to ferve pride, and policy LAre we not cruel and unfeeling as men, notto fay as chriftians? When God hath been ex¬ecuting his judgments in France, w7e look withhorror on the fcene, not on the guilt of pro¬voking to it. In fuch dreadful earthquakesas hath fhaken the w'hole nation of France,it cannot furprife us, to fee the jud boundsof property fhaken into difcord. That wemay in time be prepared againft fach convul-/* C 23 )iions as appear to fhake and overturn theprefent condition and order of Hates and king¬doms, with all the connected interefts depen¬dant on them, let us inftead of being thefriends of party, civil or religious, ftudy ju¬dicious friendfhip, which is the true image ofthe univerfal God, and our great duty to theuniverfe. Let us be ready to know, as wellwhen we offend others as when others offendus, and drive to fee our own faults as largeas we fee thofe even of our greateft enemy’s,and be as forward with lincere repentanceand humility, to feek forgivenefs of thofe wehave wickedly offended, as we could withthem who have offended us, with true peni¬tence to a Ik our forgivenefs; thus fuch gra¬cious fpirits as are enabled to overcome angerand conquer paffion, rooting out all princi¬ples of revenge, flaying enmity with love,obtain the moft acceptable and enduring vic¬tory, and may only be efteemed to triumphin reality.Thus have I fent you fome of my felecl ob-fervations on the fulfilling of fcripture, theftate and appearances of the prefent times,with fome confiderations of duty concerning( 24 )them. If you aim only at the glory of Godand your duty conne&ed therewith, for theuniverfal love of mankind, I have no fear ofyour being brought to much lofs by the fallof eftablifhed churches, or what I take to be,as formerly mentioned, the cities of the na¬tions.Now may the God of peace, that broughtagain from the dead, our Lord Jefus Chrift,that great fhepherd of the (beep, throughthe blood of the everlafting covenant, makeyou perfect in every good work, to do hiswill; working in you that which is well-plea-fing in hisfight, through JefusChrift, to whombe glory, for ever and ever. Amen.I remain, Dear Brother,Yours &.c, J. P.THE END.

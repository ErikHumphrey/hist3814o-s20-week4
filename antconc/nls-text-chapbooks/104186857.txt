He tqok thickbrose to his breakfast, and baps and alethrough the day, and when the coalssold dear, when the wind was cauld,bought an oven farl, and twa Dunbarweathers or a Glasgow Magistrate whichfish-wives ca* a westlin-herrin.His mither, auld Mary, plagued himay in the morning, got up when thehens keckled, ringed the ribs, blew hersnotter-box, primed her nose, kindled,he tobacco pipe, and at every puff,breathed out fretting against her hardfortune, and lanely single life. O but awidow be a poor name, but l live in awilderness in this Jang Lonen, tpony aman gangs by my door, but few looksin to poor auld Mary, hoch hey, will In^ver win out o’ this weary’d life ! Wa*Sawny man, wa’ Sawny man, wilt thouna rise the dav ; the sun’s up. and a’ thenibours round about; Willie ant! Charlieis to the hill an hour syne, and half gatehame again.

Do you mind, mither, thatday 1 gaed to the Pans, 1 came in byauld your kintrywoman's, theFife-wife, it cam out o' the town yecame frae, the wife that says, u Be-gd-laddie,“ I gaed there, and she fcasnain, and her cioughter kent me ; shewas unco kind, and made me f;st, fatbrose out o‘ the lee-side o' ha kail pat,there was baith beef and paunchesin‘t; ode they snaell‘d like ony haggis,and shin‘d a‘ like the gold laced waist¬coat, figs I suppet till I was like to riveo‘ them, and had a rift o‘ them themorn a' day: when I came out she spierdfor your mither, and l said ye was-gaily.And she looked to me, and leugh ay,and gripet my shakle-bane, and said,I wad be a sturdy fallow yet. —I look'd ay at her, and thought I likedher, and thinks o’nt aye sinsyne, sheleugh and bade me seek out a coal-driv¬er for her, for she didna like to carry afish creel.Mither. Forsooth Snwny, I’ll giemy twa lugs for a lav‘rock’s egg, if shebinna in love with thee, and that willbe a bargain.Sawny.

I thank youco’ Sawny, she’s meat heal, and ay wor¬king some ; how’s a* at hame? is Kateand the laddie we i.Mat.

I think some of the fishersan her may gree about it.Mat. A fisner laddie, hech the fishershas a better look out wi’ them, thefishers wad rather hae a pickle goodbaits to their hooks, and twa threebladders to their lines, than put up withsuch as her, 2 stinking pridefu* jade;a!tho‘ I bore her ay scraping and priuingkeeps her face ay as a Flanders baby,and nae less than ribbons and rings, andher shoon made of red clouts; and deilstick pride, when our auld goodam ranbarefoot, and our gutchers gade withbare-hips. Gie her a man, ill thief stapa gouk in her arse first that it may crycuckoo whene’er she speaks o't; shecan do naething but scour ladies’ piss-pots, and keep clean the ti/lie whirliesthat hangsaboon the fire; heth she's o’ergently brought up to be a poor man’spenny worth.Eegli how, co’ Sawny, and it’s een agreat pity, for she’s a weei far’d lustyhizzy, I had great kindness for her.Mat. Weei I wat, she's no lingletail’d, she may be a caff-bed to a goodfallow ; but an thou had seen me ather age ; 1 was a sturdy kimmer ; therewas nae ane about a* the Ilyne or Dub¬by-side, could lay curpen to creelwi’ me ; the fitnt a fallow in a’ Fife butI wad a laid him on the braid o’ hisback, and a’ his gear upmost, I was achicken to chatter wi’ indeed laddie ;I had a pair of cheeks like a packman'sarse, and a dank like a» ox.Sawny. Nae doubt, co’ Sawny, butye had a pair o’ beefy buttocks, foryour cheeks hing like leather bags tothis very day. But I’ll tell you whatam gaun to say to ye, do ye think that'?

Tak you laddie; tak you; afaith sbe'll tak you, for she wad a tanei a poor button thing of a half blindtaylor, wartna me, a poor bliei‘d scab-hit like creature it was, I seen the dayI wad a carried it in my pouch.

A weel then l‘ll venture onher as she is, for my mither's pleased,i and ye're pleased, and l‘m pleased, and; if she be pleased wode am sure to gether, an the taylor has nae bridled her,or tane a trying trotty p' her.Mat.

It’s burnthim it’s burnt him alive j ay, ay, mybairn he’s gone.But about the break of day, his windbroke like the bursting of a bladder;O happy deliverance, cried Mary hisraither, tho‘ dirt bodes luck, and foulfarts files the blankets, I wish ne’er warbe among us. The next thing that didSawny good, was three mutchkins ofmilk made ;n thin brose, and a fine pic-I kle pepper in them, yet he had asaugh-| ing in his lugs like a saw-mill, and everyl thing ran round about with him a‘ thati day. Yet his mither got him out ofI the bed on o' the muckle chair, a pairof blankets about his shoulders, a codat his back, and a hot brick at his soles,to gar him true he was nae weel, and1 thereat he sat like a lying-in wife, crack-Iing like a Hollander, and ate twa deadherrin and a cufe, telling a’ the outsand ins about his bridal, and whan it w asto be, for he had gotten every body’sconsent but the bride’s about it.Mith. But Sawny man, that's theI main thing, ye maun hae that too.18Sawny.

But Sawny man, what wayis thou gaun to (Jo, will you mak a paypenny wedding, or twa three gudenibours, a peck o‘ meal baken with acheese, and a barrel of ale, will that do ?Sawny. Na, na, anther, I 11 tak a cheap¬er gate nor ony of them, 1*11 gar half acrown and half a-mutchkin, or a rake ofcoals do it a‘, than a body has nae maira-do, but piss and go to bed syne.Mither.

Ah, tell na me mither, of theministers ; they're ay for their ain handsas weel as ither fouks, an if a poor beg¬gar bof*y had a bit wean to christen, a.deil a doit they'll feike them o‘t.Mither. flute awa man, there's naebody has weans but what has siller topay the christning of them: or if theybe that poor, they sud get nae weans,an they w’adna be fash'd syne.Sawny. Ha, ha, mither, the poor19i[oukss are like the lice; ay when theymeet they marry and maks mae o‘ them.And I think the ministers might christentheir bits o* weans for naetning, the wa¬ter is no sae scant; they're weel paidfor their preaching, they might veryweel baith marry and chiisten a' thepoor fouks to the bargain by the wayof mags.Mither. Ay ay my man Sawny, mar-iriage is a sweet thing for young folkand the.bed undefiled.Sawny. What the vengeance mither,Ido ye think that a body is to file theubed every night an they do it ance.Mither.

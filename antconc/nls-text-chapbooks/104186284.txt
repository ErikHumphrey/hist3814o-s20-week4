renown’d,Lie blaugLter'tl o« their native ground.Thy hospitable roofs no moreinvite the stranger to the door:In smoky ruins sunk they lie,The monuments of cruelty.The wretched owner sees afarHis all become the prey of war,Rethinks him of his babes and wife.Then smites his breast and curses life.Thy swains are famish’d on tire rocks,•W here once they fed their wanton flocks;'It. y ravish'd virgins shriek in vain!Tby infants perish on the plairf.SSrWhat boots it therein every clime,'Through the wide-spreading waste of time,Thy martial glory, crown'd with praise.Still shone with undimiufsh <3 blaze ?Thy towering spirit now is broke.Thy neck is bended to'the yoke :What foreign arms could never quell,By-ci v il rage? anti rancour fell.The rural pipe and merry lay -No more shall cheer the happy day tNo social scenes of gay delightBeguile the dreary winter night :No strains, but those of sorrow, flow,And nought is heard hot sounds of wo,W hile tliepale phantoms of the slainGlide nightly o’er the silent plain.Oh banefull cause ! oh, fatal morn,Accursed to ages yet unborn I3The sons against their fathers stooJ,The parent shed his children’s blood :Vet, when the rage of battle ceas’d,The victor’s soul was not appeas d ;The naked and forlorn must fee!Devouring flames and murdering steel.The pious mother, doom'd to death,Forsaken, wanders o'er the heath:The hleak wind whistles o’er her head,Her helpless orphans cry for bread.Bereft of shelter, food, and friend,She views the shades of night descend,And, stretch’d beneath th" inclement skiesWeeps o’er her tender babes, and dies.Whilst the warm blood bedews my veins.And unimpair’d remembrance reigns,Resentment of my country’s fateWithin my filial Fireast shall beatAnd, spite of her insulting foe,My sympathizing verse shall flow.Mourn, hapless Caledoina, mournThy banish’d peace, thy laurels torn IGEORDIE WHELPS’ TESTAMENT.WAE worth the day that I came here,To lay my fangs on Jamie’s gear 1For 1

sark.4-Wlien that was done, by slight and migi.'t'I bitch’d youi^ Jamie frae his riglit,And without ony fear or dread.I took his house out-owre his head.Pack’d up his plenishing sae braw,And to a

greet.For ilka day wi’ skaith I meet,And I maun hame to my ain craft:The thoughts o’ this hae put me daft.But yet, ere sorrow break my heart,And Satan come to claim his part,To punish me for dreary

wish’d him home with speed,fearing they were all betray’d indeed.Abounds T cried Foster,“ never fear,For Brunswick’s army is not near ;And if they dare come, onr valour we ll show,And give them a total overthrow.’But Derwentwater-soon he foundThat they were all enclos’d around.Alack !” he cried,“ for this cowardly strife,How many brave men -shall lose their fife !’*Old Madkintosth he shook his head,W l;en he saw his Highland lads Ire dead ;And he wept—not for the loss of those,But for the success of their proud foes.Then Mackintosh unto Wills he came,Saying,” I’ve been a soldier in my time,And ere a Scot of mine shall yield,We’ll all lie dead upon the field.”Then go your ways,” he made reply ;Either surrender, or you shall die,Go back to yonrown men in the town:What can you do when

dead;From his fair body they took the head ;But Mackintosh and his friends are fled,And they’ll set the hat on another head.And whether they are gone beyond the sea,Or if they abide in this country,Though our king would give ten thousand pound,Old Mackintosh will scorn to he found.osfxf M

THE LIFEMERITORIOUS TRANSACTIONS,OFJOHN KNOX,THE GREAT SCOTTISHREFORJHER.GLASGOW :PRINTED FOR THE BOOKSELLERS.61.. i jTHELIFE OFJOHN KNOX.At the Reformation one half of the lands of Scot¬land were the property of the church. David I.had made over almost the whole of those belongingto the crown, and his example was imitated, notonly by many of his successors, but by all ordersof men, with whom the founding a monastery, orendowing a church, was thought to be a sufficientatonement for the breach of every command inthe decalogue.Besides the influence derived from the natureand extent of their property, generally let on lease,on easy terms, to the younger sons and dependantsof great families, the weight the clergy had in Par¬liament was very considerable. The number of tem¬poral barons being extremely limited, and the lesserbarons and representatives of boroughs looking uponit as a hardship to attend, combined with the modeof choosing the Lords of the Articles. Its proceed¬ings in a great measure were left under their di¬rection and control.The Lords of the Articles were a Committeewhose business it was to prepare and digest all mat-t ers that were to be laid before Parliament. Everymotion for a new law was made in this committee,and approved or rejected by the members of it;what they approved was formed into a bill, andpresented to Parliament; what they rejected couldnot be introduced into the house. This committee4owed the extraordinary powers vested in it to themilitary genius of the ancient nohles, and in (hisway not only directed all the proceedings of Parlia¬ment, but possessed a negative before debate. Itconsisted of eight temporal and eight spiritual lords,of eight representatives of boroughs, and of eightgreat officers of the crown, and when its composi¬tion is considered, it will easily he seen how muchinfluence it would add to the already too great novverof the clergy.Their character also was held sacred ; neitherwere they subject to the same laws, nor tried bythe same judges as the laity, a remarkable instanceof which occurred on the trial of the murderers ofCardinal Beaton, one of whom was a priest. Hewas claimed by a delegate from the clerical courts,and exempted from the judgement of Parliamenton that account.By their reputation for learning, they almostwholly engrossed the high offices of emolument andtrust in the civil government; but even (his wasnot for acting in their capacity of confessors, theymade use of all these motives which operate sopowerfully on the human mind, to promote the in¬terest of the church, so that few' were allowed toleave the world without bestowing on her somemarks of their liberality, and where credulity failedto produce this effect, they called in the aid of law.(When a person died intestate, by the 22d Statuteof William the Lion, the disposal of his effects wasvested in the bishop of the diocese, after paying hisfuneral charges and debts, and distributing amonghis kindred the sums to which they were respec¬tively entitled, it being presumed that no Christianwould have chosen to leave the world without des¬tining some of his substance to pious purposes.)Their courts had likewise the cognisance of all tes¬tamentary deeds and matrimonial contracts, andto these engines of power, and often in their handsof oppression, they super-added the sentence of ex-communication, which besides depriving the un¬happy victim on whom it fell of all Christian pri¬vileges, cut him off from every right as a man orcitizen. To these, and other causes of a similarnature, may be ascribed the power of the Popishchurch; and to these, also, combined with the cel¬ibacy to which by the rule of their church they wererestricted, may be attributed the dissolute and li-centions lives of the clergy, which in the end des¬troyed that reputation for sanctity, the people hadbeen accustomed to attach to their character.According to the accounts of the reformers, con¬firmed by several popish writers, the manners of theScottish clergy were indecent in the extreme. Car¬dinal Beaton celebrated the marriage of his eldestdaughter with the son of the Earl of Crawford,with an almost regal magnificence, and maintaineda criminal correspondence with her mother to theend of his days. The other prelates were not moreexemplary than their primate, and the contrast be¬tween their lives, and those of the reformers, failednot to make a considerable impression on the mindsof the people. Instead of disguising their vices thePopish clergy affected to despise censure; insteadof endeavouring to colour over the absurdity of theestablished doctrines, or found them on Scripture,they left them to the authority of the church anddecrees of the councils; the only apology they haveever been able, even to the present day, to offer forthe monstrous absurdity of their system The du¬ty of preaching was left to the lowest and most il¬literate of the monks.The following anecdote will give a lively idea oftheir mode of preaching:—“The prior of theBlack Friars at Newcastle, in a sermon at St An¬drews, asserted that the Paternoster should be saidto God only, and not the saints. This doctrine notmeeting the approbation of the learned of that city,they appointed a Gray Friar to refute it, who choosefor his text, “ Blessed are the poor in spiritwhichlie illustrated in this manner. Seeing we say,good day, father, to any old man in the street, wemay call a saint pater, who is older than any alive ;and seeing they are in heaven, we may say to anyof them, “ Our father who art in heaven seeingthey are holy, we may say, “ hallowed be thy name;”and, since they are in the kingdom of heaven, mayadd, “ thy kingdom comeand as their will isGod’s will, “ thy will be done ; ” but when he cometo “ give us this day our daily bread,’’ he was muchat a loss confessing it was not in the power of thesaints to give us our daily bread; “ yet they maypray to God for us,’’ he said, “ that he may giveus our daily bread.’’ The rest of his commentarybeing not more satisfactory, set his audience alaughing and the children on the streets calling af¬ter him, Friar Paternoster, he was so much ashamedthat he left the cityThe only device by which they attempted tobring back the people to their allegiance was equal¬ly unfortunate and imprudent; they had recourseto false miracles, which the vigilance of the refor-7mers detected and exposed to ridicule. The bare¬faced impositions that were practised by the monkson the credulous, are almost inconceivable.—Amongother customs of those times, it was common forthem to travel to Rome and come home laden withrelics, blessed by his holiness, dispensations for sin,by which they wdieedled the credulous out of theirmoney. One of these, on a holiday, endeavouringto vend his wares to the country people, amongother things shewed them a bell with a rent in it,possessing the virtue of discovering the truth orfallacy of an oath ; for, as he pretended, if any oneswore truly, with his hand on the bell, he couldeasily remove it, without any change; but if theoath was false, his hand would stick to it, and thebell rent asunder. A farmer, rather more shrewdthan the rest of his auditors, suspecting the truthof this assertion, asked liberty to take an oath inthe presence of those assembled, about an affairwhich nearly concerned him. The monk could notrefuse; and the farmer addressing the crowd, said,“ Friends, before I sw'ear, you see the rent, how-large it is, and that 1 have nothing on my fingersto make them stick to the bell.’7 Then laying hishand on it, he took this oath.—“ I swear, in thepresence of the living God, and before these goodpeople, that the pope of Rome is Antichrist, andthat all the rabble of his clergy, cardinals, archbis¬hops, bishops, priests, monks, with all the rest ofthe crew, are locust, come from hell, to delude thepeople, and to withdraw them from God; moreover,I promise they will all return to hell;” and liftingbis band he added. “ See, friends, 1 have lift¬ed my hand freely from the bell, and the rent8is no larger, this sheweth that I have sworn thetruth.”The cause of reformed religion, was powerfullysupported hy the ambition of the Queen-dowager.(Mary of Guise) After the death of James V. herhusband, the Earl of Arran, was appointed Re¬gent of the kingdom during the minority of herdaughter; and from that situation she wished to ex¬clude him, that she might enjoy the first honoursof the state alone, and promote the designs of herbrothers upon Scotland. For this purpose she ap¬plied to the favourers of the Reformation, as beingthe most numerous of the Regent’s enemies, andforming a respectable body in the state; and al¬though her promises of protection were insincere,’they, in a very considerable degree, abated the furyof persecution.John Knox, who contributed so much, both hyprecept and example, to work out the Reformationfiom Popery; was the descendant of an ancientfamily, and born at Gifford, near Haddington, in1505. On finishing his education at the grammarschool, he was removed to St. Andrew’s, to com¬plete his studies under the celebrated John Mair,by whose instructions he made such progress thathe received orders before the time prescribed hy therules of the church. After this, he quitted schol¬astic learning, so much in reputation at that period,and applied himself with diligence to the readingof the fathers of the church, particularly St Angus-line, from which, attending the preaching of oneThomas Euiliam, a Black Friar, and the conversa¬tion of Mr George \Yishart, a celebrated reformer,who camo from England in 1545 with the cominis*9sinners sent by Henry VIII. to conclude a treatywith the Earl of Arran, after the death of JamesV. he attained a more than ordinary degree of scrip¬tural knowledge, and entirely renounced the RomanCatholic religion.On leaving St Andrew’s, Mr Knox acted as tu¬tor to the sons of Douglas of Longniddry, andCockburn of Ormiston, whom, besides the differentbranches of common education, he carefully instruc¬ted in the principles of the reformed religion, havingcomposed a catechism for their use, besides readinglectures to them on various portions of the scriptures.In this practice he continued till Easter 1547,when werried out by ihe repeated persecutions ofCardinal Beaton, he left Longniddry for St. An¬drew’s, resolved to visit Germany, the state of Eng¬land proving unfavourable to bis views. Againsttaking this step, however, he was persuaded by thegentlemen whose children he had the charge, to re¬main in St. Andrews, the castle of that place beingin the hands of the reformers.Here he continued to teach his pupils in the us¬ual manner, but his lectures were now attended bya number of people belonging to the town, whoearnestly intreated him to preach in public. Thistask he at first declined, but afterwards accepted acall from the pulpit, and in his very first sermondiscovered such zeal, learning, and intrepidity, asevinced the prudence of their choice, and how em¬inently qualified he was for the discharge of thoseduties. This success caused such alarm among thePopish clergy, that a letter was sent to the sub¬prior by the abbot of Paisley, natural brother of theRegent, who had been nominated to the archbisli-l10opric reproving him for his negligence, in allowingsuch doctrines to he taught without opposition. Ameeting of the clergy was held in consequence, andevery scheme they could devise put in practice tohurt Mr Knox’s usefulness; hut, in a public dis¬putation, he replied to all their arguments with somuch acuteness as completely to silence them, andgained many proselytes, who made profession of theirfaith by partaking of the communion openly, whichhe was the first to administer in the manner practisedat present.This success was not of long duration, for a bodyof French troops was sent to besiege the castle, andit was compelled to surrender on the 23d July,when he, along with the garrison, was sent prison¬er to France, and confined in the gallies till theyear 1549. On obtaining his liberty he retired toEngland, where he preached sometime at Berwick,afterwards at Newcastle and London, and was atlast chosen one of the itinerants appointed by Ed¬ward VI. to preach the Protestant doctrine throughEngland. Upon the death of that prince, on the6th July, 1553, he went to Geneva, where here-sided when he was chosen by the English churchat Frankfort, on the 24th September, 1554, tobe their pastor, a situation he accepted by the ad¬vice of the celebrated John Calvin, but which hedid not long enjoy, for having opposed the intro¬duction of the English liturgy, and refused to cele¬brate the communion according to the forms pre¬scribed by it, he was deprived of his office; and,such wTas the malice of his enemies, that, takingadvantage of a passage in his “ Admonition toEngland,” wherein he compares the Emperor to11Nero, and the Queen of England to Jezebel, theyaccused him to the magistrates of treason. Thesegentlemen perceiving the spirit by which his ac¬cusers were actuated, found means to apprise himof his danger; and on the 26th march, 1555, heleft Frankfort for Geneva, from whence he proceededto Dieppe, and shortly afterwards to Scotland, wherehe arrived in the month of August.On his arrival he found the reformers much in¬creased in number, and after assisting them to rec¬tify some errors which had crept into their practice,accompanied John Erskine of Dun to his seat inthe Mearns, where he continued a month, preachingto the principle people in that country. He after¬wards resided at Calder-house, the residence of SirJames Sandilands, where he was attended by anumber, of personages of the first rank; and, a-mong others, by the prior of St Andrew’s after¬wards earl of Moray. During the winter he visi¬ted Edinburgh ; preached in many places of Ayr¬shire ; and in the beginning of 1556, at the re¬quest of the earl of Glencairn, administered thesacrament of the Lord’s Supper to his lordship’sfamily, and a number of friends, at his seat of Fin¬lay ston.In this way did Mr Knox continue preaching,sometimes in one place, and sometimes in another,when his success excited so much attention that thePopish clergy summoned him to appear before them,on the 15th of May, in the church of the BlackFriars in Edinburgh. He did appear, but attend¬ed by such a number of followers that the clergydeemed it prudent to desist from their intendedprosecution; and that same day he addressed amuch greater audience than ever he had done onany prior occasion, and continued to do so for tendays.The earl of Glencairn, one of his firmest friends,nrevailed on the earl Marshal, and Mr HenryDrummond, to attend one of Mr Knox’s sermons,they were so highly gratified with it that they per¬suaded him to address a letter to the Queen, in thehope she also might be induced to hear the doctrineof (he reformers. In this letter, contending forihe truth of what he taught, he says, “ Albeit,Madam, that the messengers of God are not sentthis day with visible miracles, because they teachno other doctrine than that which is confirmed withmiracles from the beginning of the world, yet willnot he (who hath promised to take charge over hispoor and little flock to the end) suffer the contemptof their ambassage to escape punishment and ven¬geance, for the truth itself hath said, ‘ he that hear-eth you heareth one, and he that contemneth youcontemneth one.’ I do not speak unto you. Ma¬dam, as Pasquillus doth to the Pope and his carnalcardinals, in the behalf of such as dare not uttertheir names, but I come in the name of Christ Jes¬us ; affirming, that the religion ye maintain isdamnable idolatry, which I offer myself to prove,by the most evident testimony of God’s Scriptures ;and in this quarrel I present myself against all thePapists in the realm, desiring no other armour butGod’s holy word, and the liberty of my tongue.’It was delivered to the Queen by the earl of Glen¬cairn, and by her to the bishop of Glasgow7, (ne¬phew7 of Cardinal Beaton) with this observation,“ Please you, my lord, to read a pasquil,’’ which13coming to the ears of Mr Knox, was the occasionof his making a number of additions when the let¬ter was printed afterwards at Geneva.At this time he received letters from the Eng¬lish church at Geneva, which had separated fromthe one at Frankfort, commanding him, “ in God’sname, as he was their chosen pastor, to repair tothem for their comfort.” Having preached in al¬most every congregation he had formerly visited,and sent his wife and mother-in law before him toDieppe, he sailed from Scotland in the month ofJuly for Geneva. No sooner had he left the king¬dom than the bishops summoned him to answer acharge of heresy; and, on his non-appearance,burnt him in efhgy at the cross of Edinburgh. A-gainst this sentence, in 1558, he published his“ Appellation,” addressed to the “ Nobility andEstates of Scotland.” In this composition, whichhas been much admired, after appealing “ to a law-| ful and general council,” and requiring of them that! defence which, as princes of the people, they werehound to give him, he adds, “ these things I re-1 quire I of your honours to be granted unto me,viz. that the doctrine which our adversaries con¬demn for heresy may be tried by the plain and sim¬ple word of God; that the just defences be admit-i ted to us that sustain the battle against this pes-i tilent battle of Antichrist; and that they be re-| moved from judgment in our cause, seeing that outaccusation is not intended against any one particu-ii lar person, but against that whole kingdom whirlwe doubt not to prove to be a power usurped againstQ God, against his commandments, and against thef ordinance of Christ Jesus, established in his church14by bis chief apostles ; yea, we doubt not to provethe kingdom of the Pope to be the kingdom andpower of Antichrist, and therefore, my lords, I can¬not cease, in the name of Christ Jesus, to requireof you that the matter may come to examination,and that ye, the estates of the I'ealm, by your au¬thority, compel such as will be called bishops, notonly to desist from their cruel murdering of such as dostudy to promote God’s glory, in detecting and dis¬closing the damnable impiety of that man of sin theRoman Antichrist; but, also, that ye compel themto answer to such crimes as shall be laid to theirclwge, for not righteously instructing the flockcommitted to their care.In March, 1557, sensible of his importance, aletter, subscribed Glencairn, Erskine, Lorn, andJames Stuart, was transmitted to Mr Knox atGeneva, entreating him to return home. Havingcommunicated its contents to his congregation, forwhich he provided another minister, and taking theadvice of John Calvin, and other ministers, he setout for Scotland.Addressing himself to the lords who had invitedhis return, Mr Knox expostulates with them on ;their rash conduct, as having a tendency to cause :both them aud him to be evil spoken of.—-,f Foreither,” said he, “ it shall appear that I was mar¬vellous vain, being so solicited, where no necessityrequired, or else that such as were my movers there¬to lacked the ripeness of judgment in their first vo¬cation.” Along with this letter he sent one to thewhole nobility, and others to particular gentlemen,advising them in what manner they ought to pro¬ceed. On their receipt a new consultation was held,15ami a bond subscribed at Edinburgh on the 13thDecember, 1557, whereby they agreed to “ for¬sake and renounce the congregation of Satan, withall the superstitious abominations and idolatry there¬of.” From this period those subscribing, and theiradherents, were known by the title of the Congre¬gation. Previous to this agreement, however, anumber of letters were sent oft’ to Mr Knox, andto John Calvin, that he might use his influence inpersuading him to return.This year (1558,) the Queen Regent, throughthe concurrence of the Protestant party in Parlia¬ment, obtained an act to be passed, conferring thematrimonial crown on the Dauphin, the husbandof her daughter, the unfortunate Mary. They hadbeen induced to forward her views in this favouritescheme, that they might obtain from her an ex¬emption from that tyranny with which the ancientlaws armed the ecclesiastics against them, and en¬joy the free exercise of their religion. No sooner,however, had she obtained the gratification of herwishes, than the accomplishment of a new scheme,the placing her daughter on the throne of Eng¬land, and to which she had been prompted by theambition of her brothers, the princes of the houseof Lorraine, at that time in the plenitude of theirpower at the Court of France, rendered an unionwith the Catholics necessary. It was vain to ex¬pect the assistance of the Scots Protestants to de¬throne Elizabeth, whom all Europe considered asthe most powerful defender of the Reformed faith.She therefore began to treat them with coldness andcontempt, and not only approved the decrees of aconvocation of the Popish clergy, in which the priu-10ciples of the Reformation were condemned, but atthe same time issued a proclamation enjoining theobservance of Easter according to the ritual of theRomish church.Alarmed at these proceedings, and still more atan order summoning all the Reformed clergy in thekingdom, to attend a court of justice at Stirling, onthe 10th May, 1559, the earl of Glencairn, andHugh Campbell of Louden, were deputed to waiton her and intercede in their behalf. On urgingtheir peaceable demeanour, and the purity of theirdoctrine, she said, “ In despite of you, and yourministers both, they shall he banished out of Scot¬land, albeit they preached as true as ever did St.Paul.” And on pleading her former promises ofprotection, she replied, “ The promises of princesought not to he too carefully remembered, nor theperformance of them exacted unless it suits theirconvenience.”Perth, in the meantime, having embraced theReformed religion, added to the rage which agita¬ted the Queen against the Protestants, and shecommanded the provost (Patrick Ruthven,) to sup¬press all their assemblies. The answer of this gen¬tleman deserves to he recorded for its manly free¬dom. “ I have power over their bodies and es¬tates,” said he, “ and these I will take care shalldo no hurt; but have no dominion over their con¬sciences.” The day of trial now approached, andthe town of Dundee, and the gentlemen of Angusand Mearns, in comformity of an old custom whichprevailed in Scotland, resolved to accompany theirpastors to the place of trial. Intimidated by theirnumbers, though unarmed, she prevailed on John17Erskine of Dun, a person of great influence amongthem, to stop them from advancing nearer to Stir¬ling, while she, on her part, promised to take nofurther steps towards the intended trial. This pro¬position was listened to with pleasure, the preachersand some of the leaders remained at Perth, andthe multitude quietly dispersed to their respectivehomes.Notwithstanding this promise, on the 10th May,the queen proceeded to the trial of the persons sum¬moned ; and, on their failing to appear, sentenceof outlawry was pronounced upon them. This openand avowed breach of faith added greatly to thepuhlic irritation, and the Protestants boldly pre¬pared for their defence. Mr Erskine having joinedhis associates at Perth, his representation of theQueen’s irreconcilable hatred so inflamed the peo¬ple, that scarcely the authority of the magistrates,or the exhortations of their preachers, could preventthem from proceeding to acts of violence.At this juncture, Mr Knox landed in Scotlandfrom France, and, after residing two days in Edin¬burgh, joined his brethren in Perth, that he mightaid them in their cause, and give his confession a-long with theirs. On the 11th, the day after thesentence of outlawry was pronounced, he made avehement discourse against idolatry, and while theminds of the people were yet in a state of agitation,from the impression made upon them by his ser¬mon, a priest prepared to celebrate mass, whichmade a youth observe, “ This is intolerable, thatwhen God in his word hath plainly condemnedidolatry we shall stand and see it used in despite.”The irritated priest struck him a blow' on the ear,18and the youth in revenge threw a Stone at him,which broke an image of one of the saints. Thiswas the signal of tumult, and ere two days hadelapsed, all the churches and convents about Perthwere destroyed. Such was the anger of the Queenon receiving this intelligence, that she avowed toreduce Perth to ashes, and ordered M. D'Ossal,the commander of a corps of French auxiliaries, atthat time in the service of Scotland, instantly tomarch, and carry her threats into execution. Bothparties, however, were desirous of accommodation,and a treaty was concluded, in which it was stipu¬lated that the two armies should he disbanded, thegates of Perth set open to the queen, hut that noneof her French soldiers should approach within threemiles of that city, and that a Parliament shouldbe immediately held to settle the remaining differ¬ences.No sooner were the Protestant forces disbanded,than the Queen violated every article of the treaty.In consequence of which the earl of Argyle, andthe prior of St Andrew’s, who had been her com¬missioners for settling the peace, with some othergentlemen, openly left her. Having warned theconfederates of her intention to destroy St Andrew’sand Cupar, a considerable army was soon assembled,which assaulted Crail, broke down the altars andimages, and proceeded thence to St Andrew’s, wherethey levelled the Franciscan and Dominician mon¬asteries to the ground. The Queen immediatelygave orders to occupy Cupar, with the intention ofattacking them at St Andrew’s, but in this she wasanticipated, an army equal to her own having oc¬cupied the place two days before. Finding herselftoo weak to encounter them in the held, she hadagain recourse to negotiation ; hut mindful of herformer duplicity, the Protestants would only agreeto a truce for eight days, by which the Duke ofChatelherault and D’Ossal became bound to tran¬sport all the French soldiers to the other side of theFrith, and send commissioners to St Andrew’s withfull powers to conclude a formal treaty of peace.Several days elapsed without any person appear¬ing on the part of the queen, and suspecting somenew plan to entrap them, the Protestants, afterconcerting measures to expel the French garrison| from Perth, wrote to her Majesty, complaining thatI the terms of the first treaty were still unfulfilled,and begging her to withdraw her troops from thatcity in conformity with its stipulations. Their let¬ters remaining unnoticed, they laid siege to Perth,which surrendered, after a feeble resistance, on thei 26th June, 1559.Being informed that the Queen resolved to seizeStirling, and cut off the communication between thereformers on the opposite sides of the Frith, by ai rapid march they frustrated her plans, and in threei days, after they had made themselves masters off-Perth, the victorious reformers entered Edinburgh.The Queen on their approach retired to Dunbar,—ivhereshe amused them with hopes of an accommod-.ation, in the expectation of being joined with rein¬forcements from France. Intelligence, in themeantime, was received of the death of the Frenchiking, which, while it was favourable to the cause ofdie reformers, rendered their leaders more negligentind secure. Numbers of them left the city on theirprivate affairs, their followers were obliged to dis-iiat20perse for want of money, and those who did remainwere without discipline or restraint. The Queenreceiving advice of tliis, hy means of herspies, march¬ed with all the forces she could muster directly toEdinburgh, and possessed herself, on the 25th ofJuly, of Leith. She consented, however, to atruce, to continue till the 5th January, 1560, bywhich liberty of conscience was secured; Poperywas not to be established again where it had beensuppressed, the reformers were not to be hinderedfrom preaching wherever they might happen to be,and no garrison was to be stationed within the city.These terms were preserved till she received theexpected reinforcements, when she fortified Leith,from which all the efforts of the reformers were un¬able to dislodge her troops. A mutiny also break¬ing out among their soldiers for want of pay, anilhaving been defeated in two skirmishes with theFrench troops, it was resolved, by a majority of thelords of the congregation, to retire to Stirling. Thisrash step was productive of great terror and confu¬sion, and contrary to the advice of Knox ; who, not¬withstanding, followed the fortunes of his friends,animating and reviving them by his discourses, andexhorting them to constancy in the good cause.At a meeting held shortly after their arrival atStirling, it was resolved, to despatch William Mait¬land, who had lately deserted the Queen’s party toEngland, to imploxe the assistance of Queen Eliz¬abeth, and a treaty was at last concluded, by whicha body of troops wras sent to their assistance. Thesebeing joined by most of the Scottish nobility, a peacewas established on the 8th July, 1560, by whichI21llie reformed religion was fully established in Scot¬land.On the abolition of Popery, the form of churchgoverment establishment in Scotland was, upon themodel of the church at Geneva, warmly recommend¬ed to his countx’ymen by Knox, as being farthestremoved from all similarity to the Romish church ;and at his suggestion, likewise, the country wasdivided into twelve districts, for the more effectual¬ly propagating the doctrines of the Reformation, otwhich Edinburgh was assigned to his care. Knox,assisted by his brethren afterwards composed a con¬fession of Faith, and compiled the first books ofdiscipline for the government of the church. Thesewere ratified by a convention of Estates, held in thebeginning of the following year (1571), and an actpassed prohibiting mass and abolishing the author¬ity of the Pope.On the return of Mary, daughter of Mary ofGuise, from France, and so well known afterwardsthroughtout all Europe for her beauty, her accom¬plishments, and her misfortunes, after the death ofher husband Francis II. the celebration of mass inthe chapel royal excited a great tumult, many cry¬ing out, “ The idolatrous papist shall die the death,according to God’s law;” and John Knox, in asermon preached the Sunday following after show¬ing the judgments inflicted on nations for idolatry,added, “ one mass is more fearful to me than if tenthousand armed enemies were landed in any partot the realm, of purpose to suppress the whole reli¬gion.” In consequence of this language he wassent for by the queen, who accused him of endeav¬ouring to excite her subjects to rebellion, of having22written against her lawful authority, and of beingthe cause of great sedition. To this he answered,among other things, “ that if to teach the word ofGod in sincerity, if to rehute idolatry, and to willa people to worship God according to his word, heto raise subjects against their princes, then cannotI be excused; for it hath pleased God in his mercyto make me one amongst many to disclose unto thisrealm the vanity of the papistical religion.—Andtouching that hook, that seemeth so highly to offendyour majesty, it is most certain that if I wrote it Iam content that all the learned of the land shouldjudge of it. My hope is, that, so long as ye defilenot your hands with the blood of the saints of God,that neither 1 nor that hook shall either hurt youor your authority; for, in very deed. Madam, thatbook was written most especially against that wic¬ked Mary of England.’’ To a question by theQueen, if subjects, having power, may resist theirprinces ? He boldly answered they might, “ ifprinces do exceed their bounds.” The followingpart of the dialogue will give a good idea of (hecharacter of Knox, and the freedom of his speech :Speaking of the church, the Queen observed, " hutye are not the church of Rome, for I think it isthe true church of God.” “ Your will, Madam,”said he, “ is no reason; neither doth your thoughtmake that Roman harlot to he the immaculatespouse of Jesus Christ. And wonder not. Ma¬dam, that I call Rome-an harlot, for that churchis altogether polluted with all kinds of spiritualfornication, as well in doctrine as in matters.” Hehad afterwards two other conferences with the queen.iat the last of which she burst into tears, cryingi lout, “ Never prince was used as I am.”Knox’s situation became very critical in April,I 1571, when Kircaldy received the Hamiltons, with; their forces, into the castle. Their inveteracyi| against him was so great, that his friends wereobliged to watch his house during the night. Theyproposed forming a guard for the protection of hisperson when he went abroad; hut the governor ofthe castle forbade this, as implying a suspicion ofhim, and offered to send Melvil, one of his officers,j to conduct him to and from church. “ He wold|, gif the woulf the wedder to keip,” says Bannatyne.I Induced by the importunity of the citizens, Kir-: caldy applied to the Duke and his party for a special| protection to Knox; but they refused to pledgeI their word for his safety, because “ there were manyi rascals and others among them who loved him not,ij that might do him harm without their knowledge.”Intimations were often given him of threatenings! against his life; and one evening, a musket hall wasI fired in at his window, and lodged in the roof of the| apartment in which he was sitting. It happenedK that he sat at the time in a different part of theI room from that in which he had been accustomed totake his seat, otherwise the hall, from its direction,must have struck him. Alarmed by these circum¬stances, a deputation of the citizens, accompaniedby his colleague, waited upon him, and renewed ai request which they had formerly made, that hewould remove from Edinburgh, to a place where hislife would be in greater safety, until the Queen’sparty should evacuate the town. But he refusedto yield to them, apprehending that his enemies24wijhed to intimidate him into flight, that theymight carry on their designs more quietly, and thenaccuse him of cowardice. Being unable to per¬suade him by any other means, they at last had re¬course to an argument which prevailed. Upon thishe consented, “ sore against his will,” to removefrom the city.In May, 1571, at the desire of his friends, andfor greater security, he left that city for St And¬rew’s, where he remained until the August follow¬ing. The cause that forced him to change liis res¬idence having ceased to operate, at the express de¬sire of his congregation he again returned, but couldnot long continue to preside over it, on account ofthe exhausted state of his health ; and on the 9thNovember, abmitted Mr James Lawson, formerlyprofesssor of philosophy at Aberdeen, to be hissuccessor.From this time till the 24fh of tire same month,when he expired, about eleven o’clock at night, inthe 67 th year of his age; his principal employmentwras reading the Scriptures and conversing with hisfriends ; and over his remains, which were accom¬panied to the churchyard by the Earl of Morton,the Regent, and a number of other noblemen, andpeople of all ranks, his lordship pronounced the fol¬lowing eulogium : “ Here lies a man, who in his ’life never feared the face of man ; who hath beenoften threatened with dag and dagger, but yet hathended his days in peace and honour.”FINIS.

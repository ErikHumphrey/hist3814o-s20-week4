THE EIFEMERITORIOUS TRANSACTIONS^o?JOHN KNOX.THE GREAT SCOTTISHREFORMER,V ‘ --Ax the Reformation one half of the lands of Scot¬land were the property of the church. David I.had made over almost the whole of those belongingto the crown, and his example was imitated, notonly by many of bis successors, but by all ordersof men, with whom the founding a monastery, orendowing a church, was thought to be a sufficientatonement for the breach of every command inthe decalogue.Besides the influence derived from the natureand extent of their property, generally let on lease,on easy terms, to the younger sons and dependantsof great families, the weight the clergy had in Par¬liament was very considerable. The number of tem¬poral barons being extre.nely limited, and the lesserbarons and representatives of boroughs looking uponI it as a hardship to attend, combined with (be modeof choosing (he Lords of ihe Articles. Its proceed¬ings in a great measure were left under their di¬rection and control.I he Lords of the Articles were a C ommitteev hose business it was to prepare and diges. all mat-; : rs that were to be laid before Parliament. Everymotion for a new law was made in this committee,a id approved or rejected by the members of it;what they approved was formed into a bill, andI esented to Parliament; what they rejected couldj.ot be introduced into the house. This committeeowed llie extraordinary powers vested in it to themilitary genius of the ancient noldes, and in thisway not only directed all the proceedings of Parlia¬ment, but possessed a negative before debate. Itconsisted of eight temporal and'eight spiritual lords,of eight representatives of boroughs, and of eightgreat officers of the crown, and when its composi¬tion is considered, it will easily he seen how muchinfluence it would add to the already too great powerof the clergy.I heir character also was held sacred ; neitherwere they subject to the same laws, nor tried bythe same judges as the laity, a remarkable instanceof which occurred on (he trial of the murderers ofCardinal Beaton, one of whom was a priest. Hewas claimed by a delegate from the clerical courts,and exempted from the judgement of Parliamenton that account.By their reputation for learning, they almostwholly engrossed the high offices of emolument andtrust in the civil government; but even this wasnot for acting in their capacity of confessors, theymade use of all these motives which operate sopowerfully on the human mind, to promote the in¬terest of the church, so that few were allowed toleave the world without bestowing on her somemarks of their liberality, and where credulity failedto produce this effect, they called in the aid of law.(When a person died intestate, by the 22d Statuteof \\ illiam the Lion, the disposal of his effects wasvested in the bishop of the diocese, after paying hisfuneral charges and debts, and distributing amonghis kindred the sums to which they were respec¬tively entitled, it being presumed that no Christianwould have chosen to leave the world without des¬tining some of his substance to pious purposes.)Their courts had likewise the cognisance of all tes¬tamentary deeds and matrimonial contracts, andto these engines of power, and often in their handsof oppression, they super-a ided the sentence of :-communication, which besides depriving thehappy victim on whom it fell of all Chri tian pii-vileges, cut hirn off from every right as a man orcitizen. 'Lo these, and other causes of a similarnature, may be ascribed the power of the Popishchurch; and to these, also, combined with the cel¬ibacy to which by the rule of their church they wererestricted, may be attributed the dissolute and li¬centious Jives of the clergy, which in the end des¬troyed that reputation for sanctity, the people hadbeen accustomed to attach to their character.According to the accounts of the reformers, con¬firmed by several popish writers, the manners of theScottish clergy were indecent in the extreme. Car¬dinal Beaton celebrated the marriage of his eldestdaughter with the son of the Earl of Crawford,iwilh an almost regal magnificence, and maintaineda criminal correspondence with her mother to theend of nis days. The other prelates were not moreexemplary than their primate, and the contrast be¬tween their lives, and those of the reformers, failedinot to make a considerable impression on the mindsbf the people. Instead of disguising their vices thePopish clergy affected to despise censure; insteadjf endeavouring to colour over the absurdity of thejstablished doctrines, or found them on Scripture,they left them to the authority of the church anddecrees of the councils ; the only apology they have6ever been able, even to the present day, to offer torthe monstrous absurdity of their system ihe du¬ty of preaching was left to the lowest and most il¬literate of the monks.The following anecdote will give a lively idea oftheir mode of preaching:—“The prior of theBlack Friars at Newcastle, in a sermon at St An¬drews, asserted that the Paternoster should be saidto God only, and not the saints. This doctrine notmeeting the approbation of tbe learned of that city,they appointed a Gray Friar te refute it, who choosefor his text, “ Blessed are the poor in spiritwhichhe illustrated in this manner. Seeing wa say,gc d day, father, to any old man in the street, wemay call a saint pater, who is older than any alive ;and seeing they are in heaven, we may say to anyof them, “ Our father who art in heaven seeingtheyare holy, we may say, “ hallowed be thyname;”and, since they are in the kingdom ol heaven, mayadd, “ thy kingdom comeand as their will isGod’s will, “ thy will be .done but when lie cornsto “ give us this day our daily bread,’’ he was muchat a loss confessing it was not in the power ot thesaints to give us our daily bread; “ yet they maypray to God for us,’’ he said, “ that he may giveus our daily bread.’’ Ihe rest of his commentarybeing not more satisfactory, set his audience alaughing and the children on the streets calling al¬ter him. Friar Paternoster, he was so much ashamedthat he left the cityThe only device by which they attempted tobring back the people to their allegiance was equal¬ly unfortunate and imprudent; they had recourseto false miracles, which tno vigilance or the reiur-7, <mee detected and exposed to ridicule. The bare¬faced impositions that were practised by the monkson tie credulous, are almost inconceivable.—Amongother customs of those times, it was common forthen to travel to Rome and come home laden withrelics, blessed by his holiness, dispensations for sin,by which they wheedled the credulous out of theirmoney. One of these, on a holiday, endeavouringto vend his wares to the country people, amongother things shewed them a bell with a rent in it,possessing the virtue of discovering the truth orfallacy of an oath ; for, as he pretended, if any oneswore truly, with his hand on the bell, he couldeasily remove it, without any change; hut if theoath was false, his hand would stick to it, and thebell rent asunder. A farmer, rather more shrewdthan the rest of his auditors, suspecting the truthof this assertion, asked liberty to take an oath inthe presence of those assembled, about an affairwhich nearly concerned him. 'I he monk could notrefuse; and the farmer addressing the crowd, said,“ Friends, before 1 swear, you see the rent, howlarge it is, and that 1 have nothing on my fingersto make them stick to the hell.” I hen laying hishand on it, he took this oath.—“ I swear, in thepresence of the living God, and before these goodpeople, that the pope of Rome is Antichrist, andthat all the rabble of his clergy, cardinals, archbis¬hops, bishops, priests, monks, with all the rest ofthe crew, are locust, come fronp hell, to delude thepeople, and to withdraw them from God; moreover,I promise they will all return to helland liftinghis hand he added. “ See, friends, 1 have lik¬ed my hand freely from the bell, and the rent8is no larger, this sheweth that I have swon thetruth.”'1 he cause of reformed religion, was powerfullysupported by the ambition of the Queen-dowrger.(Mary of Guise) After the death of James V. herhusband, the Earl of Arran, was appointed Re¬gent of the kingdom during the minority of herdaughter ; and from that situation she wished to ex¬clude him, that she might enjoy the first honoursof the state alone, and promote the designs of herbrothers upon Scotland. For this purpose she ap¬plied to the favourers of the Reformation, as beingthe most numerous of the Regent s enemies, andforming a respectable body in the state; and al¬though her promises of protection were insincere,’they, in a very considerable degree, abated the furyof persecution.John Knox, who contributed so much, both byprecept and example, to work out the Reformationfrom Popery; was the descendant of an ancientfamily, and born at Gifford, near Haddington, in' 1505. On finishing his education at the grammarschool, he was removed to St. Andrew’s, to com¬plete his studies under the celebrated John Mair,by whose instructions he made such progress thathe received orders before the time prescribed by therules of the church. After this, he quitted schol¬astic learning, so much in reputation at that period,ard applied himself with diligence to the readingof the fathers of the church, particularly St Angus-line, from which, attending the preaching of oneThomas Euillam, a Black Friar, and the conversa¬tion of Mr George \\ ishart, a celebrated reformer,who camo from England in 1545 with the commis-9sinners sent by Henry VIII. to con cl ml e a treatywith the Earl of Arran, after the death of JamesV. he attained a more than ordinary decree of scrip¬tural knowledge, and entirely renounced the RomanCatholic religion.On leaving St Andrew’s, Mr Knox acted as tu¬tor to the sans of Douglas of Longniddry, andCockhurn of Ormiston, whom, besides the differentbranches of common education, he carefully instruc¬ted in the principles of the reformed religion, havingcomposed a catechism for their use, besides readinglectures to them on various portions of the scriptures.In this practice he continued till Easter 1.547,when werried out by the repeated persecutions ofCardinal Beaton, he left Longniddry for St. An¬drew’s, resolved to visit Germany, the state of Eng¬land proving unfavourable to his views. Againsttaking this step, however, he was persuaded by thegentlemen whose children he had the charge, to re¬main in St. Andrews, the castle of that place beingin the hands of the reformers.Here he continued to teach his pupils in the us¬ual manner, hut his lectures were now attended bya number of people belonging to the town, whoearnestly intreated him ter preach in public. Thistask he at first declined, but afterwards accepted acall from the pulpit, and in-his very first sermondiscovered such zeal, learning, and intrepidity, asevinced the prudence of their choice, and how em¬inently qualified he was for the discharge of thornduties. This success caused such alarm am mg thePopish clergy, that a letter was sent to the sub-prior by the abbot of Paisley, natural brother of thoRegent, who had been nominated to the archbish-10oprie reproving him. for his negligence, in allowingsuch doctrines to he taught without opposition. Ameeting of the clergy was held in consequence, andevery scheme they could devise put in practice tohurt Mr Knox’s usefulness; hut, in a public dis¬putation, he replied to all their arguments with so,much acuteness as completely to silence them, and]gained many proselytes, who made prefession of their-faith by partaking of live communion openly, whichhe was the first to administer in the manner practised;at present.This success was not of long duration, for a hodyof French troops was sent to besiege the castle, andit was compelled to surrender on the 23d July,when he, along with the garrison, was sent prison¬er to France, and confined in the gailies till theyear 1549. On obtaining his liberty he retired toEngland, where he preached sometime at Berwick,afterwards at Newcastle and London, and was atlast chosen one of the itinerants appointed by Ed¬ward VI. to preach the Protestant doctrine throughEngland. Upon the death of that prince, on theCth July, 1553, he went to Geneva, where here-sided when he was chosen by the English churchat Frankfort, on the 24th September, 1554, tohe their pastor, a situation he accepted by the ad¬vice of the celebrated John Calvin, but which hedid not long enjoy, for having opposed the intro¬duction of the English liturgy, and refused to cele¬brate the communion according to the forms pre¬scribed by it, ho was deprived of his office; and,such was the malice of his enemies, that, takingadvantage of a passage in his “ Admonition toEngland,” wherein he compares the Emperor ta11Nero, and the Queen of England to Jesebel, theyaccused him to the magistrates of treason. Thosegentlemen perceiving the spirit by which his ac¬cusers were actuated, found means to apprise himof his danger; and on the 2Gth march, 155b, heleft Frankfort for Geneva, from whence he proceededto Dieppe, and shortly afterwards to Scotland, whorehe arrived in the month of August.On his arrival he found the reformers much in¬creased in number, and after assisting them to reotify some errors which had crept into their practice,accompanied John Erskine of Dun to his seat inthe Mearns, where he continued a month, preachingto the principle people in that country. He after¬wards resided at Calder-house, the residence of SirJames Sandilands, where he was attended by anumber, of personages of the first rank; and, a-mong others, by the prior of St Andrew’s after¬wards earl of Moray. During the winter he visi¬ted Edinburgh ; preached in many places of Ayr¬shire ; and in the beginning of 1556, at the re¬quest of the earl of Glencairn, administered tbssacrament of the Lord’s Supper to his lordship’sfamily, and a number of friends, at his seat of Fiu-layston.In this way did Mr Knox continue preaching,sometimes in one place, and sometime; in anoihsr,when his success excited so much attention that thePopish clergy summoned him to appear before them,on the 15th of May, in the church of the BlackFriars in Edinburgh. He did appear, hut attend¬ed by such a number of followers lhat'the clergydeemed it prudent to desist from their intendedprosecution; and tha-t same day hs addressed a12much greater audience tlian ever he had .done onany prior oocasion, aad continued to do so for leivdays.The earl of Glencairn, one of his firmest friends,prevailed on the said Marshal, and Mr HenryDrummond, to attend one of Mr Knox’s sermons, :they were so highly gratified with it ihat they per¬suaded him to address a letter to the Queen, in thehope, she also might he induced to hear the doctrine 'of the reformers. In this letter, contending forthe truth of what he taught, he says, ** Albeit,Madam, that the messengers of God are not sentthis day with visible miracles, because they teachno other doctrine than that which is confirmed v.ithmiracles from the beginning of the world, yet willnot lie (who hath promised to take charge over hispoor and little flock to the end) suffer the contemptof their ambassage to escape punishment and ven¬geance, for the truth itself hath said, f he thathear-eth you heareth one, and he that contemneth youcontemneth one.’ I do not speak unto you. Ma¬dam, as Pasquillus doth to the Pope and his carnalcardinals, in the behalf of such as dare not utter■ir names, but I come in the name of Christ Jes¬us ; affirming, that the religion ye maintain is' ■ tunable idolatry, which I offer myself to prove,by the most evident testimony of God’s Scriptures;and in this quarrel I present myself against all thePapists in the realm, desiring no other armour butGod’s Indy word, and the liberty of my tongue.;t was delivered to the Queen by the earl of Glen-cairn, and by her to the bishop of Glasgow, (ne¬phew of Cardinal Beaton) with this observation,“ Please you, my lord, to, read a pasquil,’’ which13coming to the ears of Mr Knoi, was the ooca ion«f his making a number of additions when tlie let¬ter was printed afterwards at Geneva.At this time he received letters from the Eng¬lish church at Geneva, which had separated fromthe one at Frankfort, commanding him, “ in God sname, as he was their chosen pastor, to repair tothem for their comfort.” Having preached in al¬most every congregation he had formerly visited,and sent his wife and mother-in law before him toDieppe, he sailed from Scotland in the month ofJuly for Geneva. No sooner had lie left the king-j doin than the bishops summoned him to answer aeharge of heresy; and, on his non-appearance,burnt him in effigy at the cross of Edinburgh. A-gainst this sentence, in 1558, he published Ins“ Appellation,” addressed to the “ Nobility andEstates of Scotland.” In this composition, whichhas been much admired, after appealing “ to a law-fid and general council,” and requiring of them thatdefence which, as princes of the people, they werebound to give him, he adds, “ these things I re¬quire I of your honours to be granted unto me,viz. that the doctrine which our adversaries con¬demn for heresy may be tried by the plain and sim¬ple word of God ; that the just defences he admit¬ted to us that sustain the battle against this pes¬tilent battle of Antichrist; and that they be re¬moved from judgment in our cmse, seeing that muaccusation is not intended against any one particu¬lar person, hut against that whole kingdom windwe doubt not to prove to be a power usurped againstGod, against his commandments, and against theordinance of Christ Jesus, established in his church14by his chief apostles; yea, we doubt not to provethe kingdom of the Pope to be the kingdom anapower of Antichrist, and therefore, my lords, I can¬not cease, in the name of Christ Jesus, to requireiof you that the matter may come to examination^and that ye, the estates of the realm, hy your au¬thority, compel such as will be called bishops, noionly to desist from their cruel murdering of such as ddstudy to promote God’s glory, in detecting and dis¬closing the damnable impiety of that man of sin theRoman Antichrist; but, also, that ye compel then#to answer to such crimes as shall be laid to theircharge, for not righteously instructing the flockcommitted to their care.In March, 1557, sensible of his importance, aletter, subscribed Glencairn, Erskine, Lorn, and;James Stuart, was transmitted to Air Knox atGeneva, entreating him to return home. Havingcommunicated its contents to his congregation, forwhich he provided another minister, and taking thaadvice of John Calvin, and other ministers, he setout for Scotland.Addressing himself to the lords who had invitedhis return, Mr Knox expostulates with them ontheir rash conduct, as having a tendency to causeboth them and him to be evil spoken of.—" Foreither,” said he, “ it shall appear that I was mar¬vellous vain, being so solicited,^ where no necessityrequired, or else that such as were my movers there¬to lacked the ripeness of judgment in their first vo¬cation.” Along with this letter he sent one to thawhole nobility, and others to particular gentlemen,advising them in what manner they ought to pro¬ceed. On their receipt a new consultation was held,and a bond subscribed at EdinburgS on the 13lhDecember, 1557, whereby they agreed to “ f.r-laka and renounce the congregation of Satan, withail the superstitious abominations and idolatry there¬of.” From this period those subscribing, and theiradherents, were known by the title of the Congre¬gation. Previous to this agreement, however, anumber of letters were sent otf to Mr Knox, aridto John Calvin, that he might u?e his influence inpersuading him to return.This year (1558.) the Queen Kegent, throughthe concurrence of the Protestant party in Parlia¬ment, obtained an act to be passed, conferring thematrimonial crown on the Dauphin, the husbandof her daughter, the unfortun ite Mary. They hadbeen induced to forward her views in this favouritescheme, that they might obtain from her an ex¬emption from that tyranny with which the ancientlaws armed the ecclesiastics against them, and en¬joy the free exercise of their religion. No sooner,however, had she obtained the gratification of herwishes, than the accomplishment of a new scheme,the placing her daughter on the throne of Eng¬land, and to which she had been prompted by theambition of her brothers, the princes of the lioii'eof Lorraine, at that lime in the plenitude of theirpower at the Court of France, rendered an unionwith the Catholics necessary. It was vain to ex¬pect the assistance of the Scots Protestants to de¬throne Elizabeth, whom all Europe considered asthe most powerful defender of the Reformed faith.She therefore began to treat them with coldness andcontempt, and not only approved the decrees of a«onvocation of the Popish clergy, in which the priti-16ci[>las of the Reformation were condemned, but atthe same time is*(ied a proclamation enjoining the'observance of Easter according to the ritual of theRomish church.Alarmed at these proceedings, and still more atan order summoning all the Reformed clergy in thekingdom, to attend a court of justice at Stirling, onthe 10th May, 1559, the earl of Glencairn, and.Hugh Campbell of Louden, were deputed to waiton her and intercede in their behalf, On urgingtheir peaceable demeanour, and the purity of theirdoctrine, she said, “ In despite of you, and yourministers both, they shall be banished out of Scot¬land, albeit they preached as true as ever did St.Paul.” And on pleading her former promises ofprotection, she replied, “ The promises of princesought not to be too carefully remembered, nor theperformance of them exacted unless it suits theirconvenience. ”Perth, in the meantime, having embraced tkoReformed religion, added to :he rage which agita¬ted the Queen against the Protestants, and she-commanded the provost (Patrick Ruthven,) to sup¬press all their assemblies. 1 lie answer of this gen¬tleman deserves to be recorded for its manly free¬dom, “ I have power over their bodies and es¬tates,” said he, “ and these I will take care shalldo no hurt; but have no dominion over their con¬sciences.” The day of trial now approached, andthe town of Dundee, and the gentlemen of Angusand Mearns, in comformity of an old custom whichprevailed in Scotland, resolved to accompany theirpastors to the place of trial. Intimidated by theirnumbers, though unarmed, she prevailed on John17Srsk'me of Dan, a person of great influence anjon*-hem, to stop them from advancing nearer to Stir-ing, while she, on her part, promised to take nolirther steps towards the intended trial. 'J his pro¬position was listened to with pleasure, the preachersnd some of the leaders remained at Perth, andIhe multitude quietly dispersed to their respectiveomes.Notwithstanding this promise, on the 10th May,13 queen proceeded to the trial of the persons sum-mned; and, on their failing to appear, sentencef outlawry was pronounced upon them. This opennd avowed breach ^)f faith added greatly to theublic irritation, and the Protestants boldly pre-ared for their defence. Mr Erskine having joinedis associates at Perth, his representation of theJneen’s irreconcilable hatred so inflamed the peo-e, that scarcely the authority of the magistrates,r the exhortations of their preachers, could preventlem from proceeding to acts of violence.At this juncture, Mr Knox landed in Scotland•om France, and, after residing two days in Edin-ur^h, joined his brethren in Perth, that he mightid them in their cause, and give his confession a->ng with theirs. On the 11th, the day after themtence of outlawry was pronounced, he made a, ehemenl discourse against idolatry, and while thelinds of the people were yet in a state of agitation,om the impression made upon them by his ser-,on, a priest prepared to celebrate mass, whichade a youth observe, “ 'Ihis is intolerable, thathen God in his word hath plainly condemned^latry we shall stand and see it used in despite.”like irritated priest struck him a blow on the eai\18and the youth in revenge threw a stone at him,which broke an image of one of the saints. This\Nas the signal of tumult, and ere two days hadeiapsed, all the churches and convents about Perthwere destroyed. Such was the anger of the Queenon receiving this intelligence, that she avowed toreduce Perth to ashes, and ordered M. D'Ossal,the commander of a corps of French auxiliaries, atthat time in the service of Scotland, instantly tomarch, and carry her threats into execution. Bothparties, however, were desirous of accommodation,and a treaty was concluded, in which it was stipu¬lated that, the two armies should be disbanded, thegates of Perth set open to the queen, but that noneof her French soldiers should approach within throemiles of that city, and that a Parliament should!be immediately held to settle the remaining differ¬ences.No sooner were the Protestant forces disbanded,than the Queen violated every article of the treaty.iIn consequence of which the earl of Argyle, anCHthe prior of St Andrew’s, who had been her com¬missioners for settling the peace, with some othergentlemen, openly left her. Having warned theconfederates of her intention to destroy St Andrew’s1and Cupar, a considerable army was soon assembled, 1which assaulted Crail, broke down the altars andimages, and proceeded thence to St Andrew’s, where •they levelled the Franciscan and Dominician moa-“asteries to the ground. The Queen immediately 1gave orders to occupy Cupar, with the intention ui ‘attacking them at St Andrew’s, hut in this she was'anticipated, an army equal to her own having oo-11oupied the place two days befoie. Findin‘r here*!] ft-iltoo weak to encounter them in the field, she hadattain recourse to negotiation ; but mindful of herformer duplicity, the Protestants would only agreeto a truce for eight days, by which the Duke ofChatelherault and D’Ossal became bound to tran¬sport all the French soldiers to the other side of theFrith, and send commissioners to St Andrew’s withfull powers to conclude a formal treaty of peace.Several days elapsed without any person appear¬ing on the part of the queen, and suspecting someiiew plan to entrap them, the Protestants, afterconcerting measures to expel the French garrisonfrom Perth, wrote to her Majesty, complaining thatthe terms of the first treaty were still unfulfilled,arid begging hef to withdraw her troops from thatcity in conformity with its stipul .lions. Their let¬ters remaining unnoticed, they laid siege to Perth,which surrendered, after a feeble resistance, on the2Glh June, 1559.Being informed that the Queen resolved to seizeStirling, and cat off the communication between thereformers on the opposite sides of the Frith, by arapid march they frustrated her plans, and in threedays, after they had made themselves masters ofPerth, the victorious reformers entered^Edinburgh.The Queen on their approach retired to Dunbar,—•where she amused them with hopes of an accommod¬ation, in the expectation of being joined with reiu-aforcements from France. Intelligence, in thetfinoantime, was received of the death of the FrenchBLing, which, while it was favourable to the cause ofjkhc reformers, rendered theirleaders more negligent(and secure. Numbers of them left the city on theirHprivate affairs, their followers were obliged to dis-20perse for want of money, and (hose who did pemaiwere without discipline or restraint. The Queenreceiving advice of this, by means of her spies, march< d with alt the forces she could muster directly toEdinburgh, and possessed herself, on the 25th ofJuly, of Leith. She consented, however, to atruce, to continue tilt the 5th January, 15U0, bywhich liberty of conscience was secured; Poperywas not to be established again where it had beensuppressed, the reformers were not to be hindered?from preaching wherever they might happen to be,and no garrison was to be stationed within the city.These terms were preserved till she received theexpected reinforcements, when she fortified Leiih,from which all the efforts of the reformers were un¬able to dislodge her troops. A mutiny also break¬ing out among their soldiers for want of pay, andhaving been defeated in two skirmishes with theFrench troops, it was resolved, hy a majority of thelords of the congregation, to retire to Stirling. Thisrash step was productive of great terror and confu- <sion, and contrary to the advice of Knox ; who, not¬withstanding, fdlowed the fortunes of his friends,animating and reviving ’hem by his discourses, andexhorting them to constancy in the good cause.At a meeting held shortly after their arrival atStirling, it was resolved, to despatch William Mait¬land, who had lately deserted the Queen’s party toEngland, to implore the assistance of Queen Eliz¬abeth, and a treaty was at last concluded, hy which |a body of troops was sent to their assistance. Thesebeingjoined by most of the Scottish nobility, apeacewacs established on the 8th July, 1560, hy which»e reformed religion was fully established in Soot-uid.On the abolition of Popery, the form of churchoverment establishment in Scotland was, upon thetodelof the church at Geneva, warmly recointnend-d to his countrymen by Knox, as being farthestimoved from all similarity to the Romish church ;ad at his suggestion, likewise, the country wasivided into twelve districts, for the more effectual-r propagating the doctrines of the Reformation, othlch Edinburgh was assigned to his care Knox,isisted by his brethren afterwards composed a con-ssion of Faith, and compiled the first books ofsciplinefor the governmentof the church. j he;eeie ratified by a convention of Estates, held in theiginning of the following year (1571), and an actissed prohibiting mass and abolishing the author-y of the Pope.On the return of JV^ry, daughter of Mary ofuise, from trance, and so well known afterwardsTQughtout all Europe for her beauty, her accom-ishments, and her misfortunes, af:er the death of:r husband Francis II. the celebration of mass ine chapel royal excited a great tumult, many e y-g out, “ ihe idolatrous papist shrdl die the death,cording to God’s law;” and John Knox, in armpn pleached the Sunday following afier show-g the judgments inflicted on nations for idolatry,ded, “ ne mass is more fearful to me than if tenousand armed enemies were landed in any partthe realm, of purpose to suppress the whole reli-on.” In consequence of this language he wasat for by the queen, who accused him of endrav-ripg to excite her subjects to rebellion, of having22writ Lem against her lawful authority, and of bsin;the cause of great sedition. To this he answeredamong other things, “ that if to teach the word qGod in sincerity, if to rehute idolatry, and to wi!a people to worship God according to Ins word, hto raise subjects agdnst their princes, then eamuiI he excused; for it. haih pleased God in his mereto make me one amongst many to disclose unto th:realm the vanity of the papistical religion.—An]touching that book, thatseemeih so highly to ofFenlyour majesty, it is most certain that if L wrote it ;am content that all the learned of the land shoufijudge of it. My hope is, that, so long as ye detilinut your hands with the blood of the saints of Godthat neither 1 nor that book tdiall either hurt yotor your authority; for, in very deed, Madam, thaibook was written most especially against that wicjked Mary of England.’’ To a question by thiQueen, if subjects, having power, may resist tliti'princes ? Ire hoidlj answered they migbt, “ iprinces do exceed their bounds.” The followingpart of the dialogue will give a good idea of (Incharacter of Knox, and the freedom of bis speech :Speaking of the church, the Queen observed, “ bu;ye are not the church of Rome, for I think it ithe true church of God. ” “ 1'our will, Madam,"said he, 11 is no reason; neither doth your thoughtmake that Roman harlot to be the immaculattspouse of Jesus Christ. And won er not, Midam, that I call Rome an harlot, for that chnrdis altogether p.dinted with all kinds of spirituifornication, as wall in doctrine as in matters.”had afterwards two other conferences with the quel®?,t the hwt of which sha burst into tears, cryingut, “ Netar prince was used as I am.”Knox’s situation became very critical in April,571, when Kircaldy received the Hamiltons, withheir forces, into the castle. Their inveteracytgainst him was so great, that his friends wereibliged to watch his house during the night. They•roposed forming a guard for the protection of his(arson when he went abroad; but the governor of■he castle forbade this, as implying a suspicion ofrim, and offered to send Melvil, one of his officers,:n conduct him to and from church. “ He woldrif the woulf the we lder to keip,” says Bannatyne..nduced by the importunity of the citizens, Kir-laldy applied to the Duke and his party for a specialirotection to Knox; but they refused to p'edretheir word for his safety, because “ there were manyrascals and others among them who loved him not,that might do him harm without their knowledge.”Intimatiois were often given him of threateningsagainst his life; and one evening, amu*ket ball wasfired in at his window, and lodged in the roof of theapartment in which he was sitting. It happenedithat he sat at the time in a different part of theroom from that in which he had been accustomed totake his seat, otherwise the hall, from its direction,must have struck him. Alarmed by these circum¬stances, a deputation of the citizens, accompaniedby his colleague, waited upon him, and renewed arequest which they had formerly m id^, that hewould remove from Edinburgh, to a place where hislife would be in greater safety, until the Queen’sparty should evacuate the town. But he refusedto yield to them, apprehending that his enemies24 1Vri hed to intimidate him into flight, that (hermight carry on their designs more quietly, and thenaccuse him of cowardice.

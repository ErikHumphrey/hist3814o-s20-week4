Canaan lived a man of righteousness,Whom the great God in love was pleas’d to blessWith twelvesweet sons, one Joseph called byname.Whose worthiness we’ll to the world proclaim.Being endued with blessings from above,He gained the favour of his father’s love,Now while his brothers hated him, behold !He dream’d a dream, which unto them he told;Saying, “As we were binding in the fieldOur sheaves of wheat, it was to me revealedThat mine arose upright, and yours around,Stood making low obedience to the ground.”These words of his, they did anger breed;They say, must you reign over us indeed ?The like of this was never known beforeThus for his dreams they hated him the move.4His Second Dream.Soon after this as Joseph sleeping lay,Free from the toils and troubles of the day,He dreamed a second dream, and told the sameUnto his brothers, as to them he came;Saying, in sleep appeared before my eyes,The sun, the moon, the seven stars likewise,All making their obedience unto me,With meek and humble humility.He told it likewise to his father dear,Who chid him, saying, what is this I hear?Must I, thy mother, and thy brothers too,Be all obliged to bow the knee to you,Low on the earth, as if you reigned and ruled :’Tis very hard that aged parents shouldA meek and lowly veneration payTo you who ought to honour and obey.5He is put into the Pit.This very paragvah will clearly showHow they did seek young Joseph’s overthrow,H is father sent him to the rural plain,Where with their flocks his brothers did remain.When afar off young Joseph they espied,Behold, here comes the dreamer now, they criedLet us conclude to take his life away,And cast him in a pit without delay,Then see how all his dreams will come to pass :But Reuben, Reuben pitied him, alas !And hid him in the pit, there to remain,Till he might safe conduct him h«me again.What mortal man is able to express,Poor Joseph’s grief when in the wildernessHe lay confined ? no doubt hn present fearsCaused his youthful eyes to flow with tears.6He is sold into Egypt.While in the pit young Joseph lay confined,They sat them down to eat, and ere they dinedSome Ishmaelites from Egypt passed by;Then Judah made his brothers this reply,*' What shall it profit to us now, I pray,If we should take this precious life away ?”They all consented to the same with speed,For loth they were to see their brother bleed.Then from the lonesome pit the child they drew,And sold him to those trading merchants, whoA se^re of silver pieces for him paid.And then to Egypt he was soon conveyed.When Reuben found him sot, how did he grieveThe rest contrive their father to deceive,By staining Joseph’s coat with purple blood,Which caused poor Joseph many a weeping flood.When Joseph to the land of Egypt came,One Potiphar a man of noted fame,Bought him with silver and preferred him straightMaking him steward of his whole estate.On whom his mistress cast her wanton eyes,And he reproved her, and said, be wise,And cast, henceforth, these idle thoughts away How can I do that wicked thing, 1 pray ?Now finding her entreaties would not do,She went to seize him, but away he flew,Leaving his garment in her hand also:Now from that time she proved his mortal foe:She said, my lord, (when he returned at niaht),Thy Hebrew servant strove with all his might,To mock thy lady, but was ne’er the near,I cried, he fled, and left his garment here.7Tempted by Potiphai’s \fyife.sCast into the Dungeon.No sooner had she made this false reportOf Joseph’s coming in so vile a sort,But Potiphar immediately he flewInto a sad and cruel passion too,And cast him into prison where he layTill the chief butler and the baker, theyBy Pharaoh’s strict command were sent to beConfined from their former liberty.The baker and the butler both, we findWith dreams one night were much disturbed inmind,When they to Joseph did themselves apply,He told them what their dreams did signify;One he restores unto his former place,The other, he must die in sad disgrace;The butler must his former place supply,The baker by the laws be doomed to die.9He is made Lord of the Land.Still Joseph lay confined in prison fast.Until two tedious years were gone and past.At length Pharoah dreamed, but none in the landCould his dream interpret or understand. »Then the chief butler to the king did say,“ I needs must own my faults this day:In prison lies a Hebrew servant there.Who will the truth of all your dreams declare:Then from a prison to a palace straight,Joseph was brought, and Pharoah did relateHis dreams, and did full satisfaction find,Which eased the grief and anguish of his mind :He gave such satisfaction to the king.That from his royal hand he drew a ring,And gave it Joseph, saying, “ Thou shalt beNext to myself in royal dignity.”10His Brethern going to buy Corn.Behold the dreams of Pharoah did fortell,A mighty famine, which at length befell;Joseph in Egypt was head ruler over all;t But when his brothers came, and seemed to fallBefore him, straight his dreams came in his mind,Yet he spoke rough, and seemed most unkind :You’re spies said he, they answered, no,We are true men, my lord, pray say not so,Sons ol one man, we twelve in number were,The youngest now under his father’s careRemains at home, the other he is not.He knew them, yet his anger seemed hot,And for three days they were in prison cast,Confined they lay, yet Joseph came at last,And laid upon them all a strict command,To bring their young brother out of hand.11The Cap in Benjamin’s Sack.When they had eaten up their slender store,Jacob he needs must send them down for more;But knowing that his youngest son must go,His eyes with melting tears did overflow'.With presents then they did return again,And Joseph doth them kindly entertain.When he his brother Benjamin beheld,His bowels yearned, his heart with joy was filled ;But here’s a grief which did them all surround.The nightly lord, his silver cup was foundOn Benjamin; this made them sore afraid,That for that crime they would be captives made<Then to the house of Joseph they returned,Judah he pleaded, till his bowels yearned,To be a captive in his brother’s room,Lest he should see his father's threatened doom.12Joseph DVcIaivtli liiinself.‘ My lord hear thy servant now I pray.Our father, when we brought the child awayExpressed such grief and sorrow for his sake,That if he stay, his aged heart will break:Seeing his tears, which fell like showers of rain,1 promised then he should return again.Therefore, my lord, pray let him go, for I>\rn loth to live to sec my father die”Joseph from tears could now no longer hold;He said, “ I am your brother whom you soldTo Egypt, when on me your anger fell;And is my father yet alive and well.”Then on each other’s neck they wept amain.Their cries were heard, from tears could not refrainO fetch my father hither, Joseph cried,That for the' family I may provide.”ISJaeob's Jeurney into Egypt.The sons of Jacob Pharoah did command,1 o take both food and waggons from the landOf Lgypt, to fetch their father straight,They did, and poor old Jacob’s joy was great;He said, still as his spirits did revive,It is enough, Joseph is yet alive,I he son for whom I mourned, therefore I\Vill go and see him now before I die.then on his joujney still he doth proceed,And in the land of Goshen, there indeedJoseph did meet him, whom he straight did bringInto the royal pressnce of the king.When Jacob before king Pi-.aroah stoodHis age one hundred and thirty years, a goodOld man was he; Pharoah gave to his race,I he land of Goshen for a dwelling place.14Joseph visits his Father.When Joseph knew his pious father layOn his sick bed, to him he hastes away,Joseph he brought Manasseh and Ephraim,Placed before his father’s eyes now dim,At sight of them, cries Jacob, who are these,My sons, says Joseph from between my knees.When near, he kissed them, & with sweet embraceAdmires his GOD to his Joseph’s face.These boys of thine which were in Egypt born,They shall be mine, not orphans or ^ol!orn’r.-nManasseh he blest, commends him to his GOD,Bids him to mark the steps that Abraham trod,Displeased was Joseph to see his elder sonPut by, and the younger the blessing won,But Jacob replied, son, 1 know it well.For Ephraim shall unto great nations swell.. 15Jacob Blesseth his Son.Jacob he calls his first born, Reuben, near,Weak as the water from the fountain clear;Simeon and L®vi, men of cruelty,They smote a.man, and caused him so to die.Judah’s bright sceptre shan’t from him departTill Shilo come rejoicing every heart.Zebulun’s a small port where tall ships may pass,Issacher well resembles the couchant ass.Dan as a jndge will do his people right.Gad by a troop at last will win the fight;Asher his bre^d is fat, and of a dainty sort,Naphtali’s a hind loosed for the hunter’s sport.Joseph’s a bough laden with pleasent fruit,Near to a well, whose branches sap recruit:Benjamin like a ravenous wolf doth slay,Devours his prey, then bears the spoil away.Filial affection’s to old Jacob good,When Canaan’s land lay destitute of food,Then Joseph kind his aged father ted,When thousands daily starved for want of breadHis love expressed with mind sedate and calm,Then with rich spices did his corpse embalm ;When breathless lay upon a bed of down,He treats blest Jacob, father of renown ;Falls on his clay and with a kind embrace.Salutes the late most venerable faceOf Pious Jocob, now growing stiff and cold.It must be so when life is charged to mould,Plenty of tears did from his eye balls flow.To show mankind he did his duty know,That nought’s too much to pay a parent dear,From children that the awful GOD do fear.If)-Joseph’s love to his Father.17Jacob’s Funeral.When seventeen long years Jacob haJ dwelt,Behold, the fatal hand of death he felt:To Joseph he commits the special careOf his great funeral, and tells him whereHe would be laid, whiah was fulfilled at large.According to the tenor of his charge;For having yielded up his vital breath,He dropped into the frozen arms of death.Numbers of mourning coaches out of handPrepared were; thus to his native landHe was conveyed a sleeping place to have,Nenr to the borders of his lather’s grave.Upright he was, and just in all his ways;Pray now observe the number of his days,He was, when he dropt off this earthly stage,One hundred and forty-seven years of age.THELIFE OF St. PALL.Saint Paul, though not one of the twelve, yet for hisgreat eminence in the ministerv of the gospel, had the hon¬our to l)e styled an apostle, particularly above all the rjstthat were not of the number, and hath justly the nextplace to St. Peter alloted to him, both in regard theywere so conversant in their lives, and inseparable in theirdeaths. He was horn at Tarsus, not only of Jewish pa¬rents. hut originally descended from an ancient Jewishfamily of the tribe of Benjamin in Judea, where he had hiseducation, which was a flourishing Academy, whose scho¬lars (as Strabo testifies) excelled tlioso of Alexandria, andeven Athens itself. In the schools of this city, he wasbrought up from his childhood, and became an excellentproficient in all the polite learning of the ancieents, yet atthe came time he was brought up to a manual trabe, aseven the most learned of their Rabbins were, for enahhagthem to get a livelihood if occasion required it, it being amsxim (especially amongst the Jews), that he who teach-eth not his son a trade, teacheth him to be a thief; forlearning of old was not made an instrument to get a main¬tenance by, but for the better polishing the mind ; so thatthe learned among the Jews were frequently denominatedihs Drusius observes) from some one or other handycrafttrade, as Rabbie Judah, the baker; Rabbie Jochanan, theShoemaker, &c.Having at Tarsus attained to a great perfection in thellibera! arts and sciences. He was sent to Jerusalem to be(instructed in the knowledge of the laws; and for the bet-iter accomplished him in that study, was put under the(tuition of Raban Gamaliel the son of Simon, (the sameprobably that took up our Saviour in his arm). He wasan eminent doctor of the law, one of the families of theschools at Jerusalem, and a person of principal note andlauthority in the Jewish Sanhedrim, in which that graveand prudent speech, before mentioned in the Life of St.•Peter, which he made in behalf of the apostles, and their(doctrine took great effect. At the feet of this great doc-itor St. Paul was brought up, as he himself testifies; andiby his instructions he soon advanced to that degree, thatdie gained himself a reputation above all his fellow scholars.(Moreover he was a strict professor of the sect of the pha-irisees, which of all others amongst the Jews, was the se¬verest and most magisteral; and the professors thereof,generally great applauders of themselves for their sanctity,despising and censuring all others as reprobates, and un¬worthy of their society, and presuming (as Josephus writes)to govern even princes themselves. With the fiery geniusof this sect, our apostle was too deeply infected, whichmade him a most zealous Persecuter of the Saints, so thatwhen the blood of the Martyr Stephen was shed, I (saithihe with sorrow after his conversion) was standing by, con-isented to his death, arid kept the Raiment of them thati slew him. Nay, of all the Apparators, and Inquisitors!employed by the Sanhedrim, to execute their Warrants;upon those upstart Heretics, as they called them, whopreached against the law of Moses, and the tradition ofthe Fathers ; he was the Man that strove to be the forward-est. In this zeal to execute his office, as he was on hisj way to Damascus, with some others of his fellow officers,t breathing out vengeance and destruction against the poorChristians, there was on a sudden a most glorious lightshot full upon him, and the rest that were with him, sothat they fell to the ground in great amazement, and at the' same time a voice from heaven was directed to him, sav¬ing. “ Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?" to whichi us amazed as te was answered, Lord who art thou ? thevoice replying, that it was Jesus whom he persecuted,and that it was hard for him to kick against the pricks,He again desired further instructions, Lord, said he, whatwilt thou have me to do? upon which he was bid to rise,and go to Damascus, and there expect what should befurther revealed to him; rising from the ground he foundhis sight gone. In this plight being led to Damascus, hewas there three days fasting, and probably then he sawthat celestial vision mentioned by him, wherein he heardand saw things past utterance, and those divine revel¬ations, which gave him occasion to say, that the gospel hepreached, he was not taught by man, but had it revealedto him by Jesus Christ. The three days being expired,Ananias, a devout man, and one of the seventy disciplescame to him, according to the command he bad receivedfrom our Lord, who appeared to him, to go and enquirefor one Saul of Tarsus, and having laid his hands on him,told him his message, upon which his sight was restoredto him, and the gift of the Holy Ghost conferred on him ;presently after he was baptized, and made a member ofthe church, to the great joy of the rest of the disciples,that he should become not only a professor, but a preacherof that faith, which he so lately was a bitter persecutor of.His stay at this time at Damacus was not long, for beingwarned away by a vision from heaven, he took a journeyinto Arabia, where he preached the gospel for three years,and then returned to Damascus, where the unconvertedJews eagerly sought his ruin, endeavouring to seize him,but he escaped through the help of the disciples, and therest of his friends who were zealous for his safety.Thus far we have made an entrance into the life andacts of this great apostle, with which there is scarcely anything equally memorable in history, nor could the furtherprosecution thereof have been omitted, but that all the tra¬vels of this apostle in the pursuance of his minintry, fromthe time of his conversion to the last of his being at Rome,with the most principal transactions, and the severest ac¬cidents that happened to him therein, are already relatedin the exposition of the map of the voyages of the apostles,and more particularly those of St. Piul, in which, foravoiding needless repetitions, the sequel of his life may not21unfitly be referred. We shall therefore make seme en¬quiry into the time and occasion of the several epistleswrote to the several churches ; as also unto the time andmanner of his death, and so proceed to the lives of therest of the apostles.When he went from Athens to Corinth, it is said hewrote his first epistle to the Thessalonians, which he sentSilas and fimothy, who returned during his stay, and be¬fore his departure he wrote his second epistle to them, toexcuse his not coming to them as he promised in his first.Not long after at Ephesus, he is said to write his epistleto the Galatians; and before he left Ephesus, he wrote hisfirst epistle to the Corinthians. Moreover, he sent fromthence b* Apollos and Silas to Titus, whom be left in thatIsland to propagate the faith, and had made him bishopthereof, in which he gives him advice for the better exe¬cution of his episcopal office. At Macedonia, whetherhe went from Ephesus, having by Titus received an ac¬count of the church of Corinth’s present state of affairs, hesent by him at his return, when he was accompanied bySt. Luke, his second epistle to the Corinthians; and aboutthe same time he wrote his first epistle to Timothy, whomhe had left at Ephesus. From Corinth he went for Ma-cedon, whether he sent his Epistle to the Romans, byPhoboe, a deaconess of the Church of Cenchrea, not farfrom Corinth. Going thence to Rome, he sent his Epistleto the Phillippians by Epaproditus, who had been sentfrom them with relief, not knowing to what st eights hemight he reduced by bis imprisonment at Rome. In thenext place, he sends by 1 ychicus bis epistle to the Ephe¬sians. Not long after, (if not, about the same time), hewrote his epistle to the Colossians, and sent it by Epa-phias his fellow-prisoner for some time at Rome. As forhis second epistle to I imothy, there is some dispute aboutthe time of his writing it; ordy it seems probable by au¬thentic authors, tl.at it was writ after the PI il ppians andEphesians. As for the epistle to the Hebrews, it is natknown when, or from whence, written, and rather conjec¬tured than certainly known to have been St. Pauls. Ter-tulliah judgeth it to he written by Barnabas; but the mostreceived opinion is, that it was St. Pauls but written byhim in Hebrew, and so sent to the Jews, and for tke bet¬ter publishing it to the Gentiles, translated into Greek,some say by St, Luke, but others probably by St. Clement,for the style of whose epistle to the Corinthians is observedby Ephesians and Pt. J< rum to come very near the style ofthis epistle, and to contain a purer vein of Greek than isfound in the rest of St. Paul's epistles.Our apostle having been now two years a prisoner atRome, is at length set free, and soon after departs to visitother parts of the world, for the further divulging the gos¬pel, but into what particular parts is variously conjectured ;some think into Greece, and some parts of Asia, where hehad not yet been ; others will have it that he went pleach¬ing, as well into the Eastern as Western parts of theworld ; for in his epistle to the Corinthians it is said, thatPaul being a pieacher both Eastward and Westward,taught righteousness to the whole world, and went to theutmost hounds of the West. That he went in'o Spain,may he gathered both from his own words, as intimatingso to do, ami also from the testimony of other authors, asTheodoret, who writes, that he not only went into Spainto preach, but brought the gospel into the isles of the sea,and particularly into our island of Britian; and more par¬ticularly in another place, he reckons up the Gauls andthe Britains amongst those j eople to whom the apostles,and espically the tent maker, as he calls him, had divulgedthe Christian faithFarther mention of St. Paul we find none till his nextand last coming to Rome, which is said to be about the8th and 9th years of Nero’s reign ; and he came in thefittest time to suffer martyrdom he could have chosen; forwhereas at other times, his privilege of being a Romancitizen gained him those civilities which common moralitycould not deny him, he had to do with a person with whomthe crime of being a Christian weighed down all apologiesthat could he alledged; a person whom lewdness and de¬bauchery had made seven times more a Pagan than anycustom or education could have done. What his accusa¬tion, cannot he certainly determined, whether it was hisbeing an associate with St. Peter in the fall of Simon Ma¬gus, or his conversion of Poppaea Sabina, one of tbc Em-if)ei'*is c»nrutiine», lir which he w#s curbed in the «*refrlot hi« insatiate appetite. Neither can it he resolved howi long he, remained in prison, what the certain time of' hia'suffering was, and whether (according to the custom) hewas fir't scourged ; on'y Ih r n ons spi aks of two pillars inthe church of St. Maty, beyond tbe bridge in Koine towhich both he and St. Peter wore bound, when they were•courged.It is affirmed that St. Paul and St. Peter suffered uponthe same day, though different kinds nf death. Otherswill have it that they suffered on the same day of theyear, but at a year’s distance t atid others affirm that St.Paul suffered several years after St. Petet ; hut all agree,that Paul, as a Homan, had the favour to he beheaded,and not crucified. His execution was at the Aqua; Sal¬via, 3 miles from Rome; and he is said to have convertedthe three soldiers that guarded him thither, who also suf¬fered for the faith. Some of the fathers add, that upon hisdeath, there flowed from his veins a liquor more like milkthan blood, the sight whereof (saith St. Crysostom) con¬verted the executioner.He was buried about two miles from Rome, in the waycalled Via Ostiensis, where Lucina, a noble Roman matronnot long after settled a farm for the maintenance of thechurch. Here he lay but indifferently, (as we may well(•uppose) entombed for several ages, that is, till the reigniof Constantine the Great, who in the year of our Lord,1318, at the request of Sylvester, that Bishop of Rome,ibuilt a very sumptuous church, supported with a hundred'stately pillars, and beautified with a most rare and exquisite• workmanship, and after all, richly gifted and endowed bythe emperor himself Yet was all this thought too meanan honour for so great an apostle by the emperor Valen-tinian, who sent an order to his Prsefect Salustinus, totake that, church down, and to erect in its room one morelarge and statelier, which, at the instance of the Pope Leo,was richly adorned, and endowed by the Empress Placi-dia, and doubtless, hath received great additions eversince, from age to age.Thus was brought up, became converted, and a preacherof the gospel, and thus was pwt death and buried, thisCS ^CMpr<*at apostle of the Bentiles, superior in learning and na¬tural parts, end uot inferior in zeal to any of the rest ofthe apostles.We cannot close more fitly, perhaps, than by extractingfew lines from the powerful summing up by tbe poetoung.“ What am I? and from whence?—I nothing know,But what I am: and since I am, concludeSomething eternal: had there e’er been nought,Nought still bad been : eternal there must be.But what eternal?—Why not human race?And Adam’s ancestors without an end.''That’s hard to be conceiv’d. Yet grant it true,Whence earth and these bright orbs?—Eternal too?Grant matter was eternal, still these orbsWould want some othei father;—much designIs seen in all their motions, all their makes:Design implies intelligence, and art;That can’t he from themselves, or toan; that artMan scarce can comprehend, could man bestow?Who motion, foreign to the smallest grain,Shot through vast masses of enormous weight?Who hade brute matter's restive lump assumeSuch various forms, and gave it wings to fly ?Has matter innate motion ? then each atom,Asserting its indisputable rightTo dance, would form an universe of du>t:Has matter none? Then whence these glorious formsAnd boundless flights, from shapeless, and repos d ?Has matter mo'e than motion?—las it thought,Judgment, and genius?—is it deeply learn’dIn mathematics? Has it fram’d such laws,Which hut to guess a Newton made immortal?—If so, how each sage atom laughs at me,\\ ho thinks a clod inferior to a man !If art to form, and counsel to conduct,And that with greater far than human skill,Besides not in each block—a Godhead reigns—And if a God there is, that God how great!”THE END.

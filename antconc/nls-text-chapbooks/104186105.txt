Col., Cam.,Which means, in proper spelling,Trinity College, Cambridge,There resided oneHarry Dorrington ;A youth excellingIn all the learning commonly providedFor those who chose that classic stationFor finishing their education:That is, he understood computingThe odds at any match,Or race;Was a dead hand at pigeon-shooting;Could kick up rows, knock down the watchPlay the truant, and the rake at random,Drink, tie cravats, and drive a tandem.Remonstrance, fine, or rustication,Instead of working reformation,Only made his lapses greater ;Until warned, the next offencefehould have this certain consequence Expulsion from his college.One need not be a necromancer,To judge, that with so wild a wight,The next offence occurred next night,When our incurable came rollingHome as the midnight chimes were tolling,And rang the college bell No answer;The second peal was vain ;The third made the street echo its alarm,When, to his great delight, he heard4That sordid janitor, old Ben,Rousing and growling in his den;“ Who’s there? I suppose young harum searum.’“ 'Tis I, my worthy Ben—’tis Harry.”“ Ay, I thought so, and there you’ll tarry;’Tis past the hour, I’ve closed the gate,You know my orders ; you’re too late;I shall lose my place if I undo the door.”“ And I,” young hopeful interposed,“ Shall be expelled, if you refuse.”Ben began to snore.“ I’m wet,” cries Harry, “ to the skin,Hip ! holloa, Ben ! don’t he a ninny,Beneath the gate I’ve thrust a guinea,So tumble out and let me in.”“ Humph,” growled the greedy old curmudgeon,Half overjoyed, and half in dudgeon,“ There now, you may pass,But make no fuss,On tiptoe walk, and hold your prate.”“Look on the stones, old surly,”Cries Harry, as he passed the gate;“I’ve dropp’d a shilling; take the light.You’ll find it just outside—good night.”Behold the Porter, in his shirt,Chiding the rain which never stopt,Roping and groping in the dirt,And all without success;But that need hardly to be wondered atBecause no shilling had been dropt.So, tired, he gave o’er the search at last,Regain’d the door, and found it fast;With sundry growls and groans he rang—Once, twice, thrice;When, mingled with giggling, heard the tones of HeMimicking old Ben :—“ Whose there ?It is really a disgrace to ring so loud;It’s past the hour; I’ve closed the gate;You know my orders—you’re too late ;You would not have me lose my place ? ”“ Pshaw, Mr. Dorrington, rememberThis is the middle of November;I’m stripp’d—’tis raining cats and dogs.”“Hush! hush!” quoth Hal, “I’m fast asleep,”And then he snored as loud and deepAs a whole company ot hogs.‘‘But harkee, Ben, I’ll grant admittanceAt the same rate I paid myself.”“ Nay, master, leave me half the pittance, ’Cried the avaricious elf.“ No, no all or none; a full acquittance:The terms are somewhat high, I own, ^But it was you who fixed the price—not I.So, finding all his haggling vain,Ben, with a grin and groan of pain.Drew out the guinea and restored it.“ Surely you’ll give me,”—cried the outwitted Porter,When again admitted,“ Something, now you’ve done your joking,For all this trouble, time, and soaking.“ Oh! surely, surely,” Harry cries;“ Since, as you urge, I broke your rest,You are half drowned, and quite undrest,I’ll give you—leave to go to bed.”° Axon.the milkmaid and the banker.A milkmaid, with a very pretty face,Who lived at Acton,Had a black cow, the ugliest in the place,A crooked back’d one;A beast as dangerous, too, as she was frightful,Vicious and spiteful,And so confirm’d a truant, that she boundedOver the hedges daily, and got pounded.’Twas all vain to tie her with a tether,For then both cord and cow eloped together.Arm’d with oaken bough, (what folly!It should have been of birch, or thorn, or holly,)Patty, one day, was driving home the beast,Which had, as usual, slipp’d its anchor,When on the road she met a certain banker,Who stopp’d to give his eyes a feastBy gazing on her features crimson’d highBy a long cow-chase in July.“ Are you from Acton, pretty lass,” he cried:“ Yes,” with a courtsey, she replied.“ Why, then, you know the laundress, Sally Wrench?“ She is my cousin, sir, and next door neighbonr.“ That’s lucky—I’ve a message for the wench,Which needs despatch, and you may save my labour;Give her this kiss, my dear, and say I sent it,But mind you owe me one—I’ve only lent it."“ She shall know,” cried the girl, as she brandish’d her bough,“ Of the loving intentions you bore me;But as to the kiss, as there’s haste you’ll allow,That you’d better run forward and give it my cow;For she, at the rate she is scampering now,Will reach Acton some minutes before me."Anon.THE CLOWN AND THE COUNSELLOR.A Counsel in the Common Pleas,Who was esteem’d a mighty wit.Upon the strength of a chance hitAmid a thousand flippancies,And his occasional bad jokesIn bullying, bantering, browbeating,Ridiculing, and maltreatingWomen or other timid folks.In a late cause, resolved to hoaxA clownish Yorkshire farmer—oneWho, by his uncouth look and gait,Appear’d expressly meant by Fate,For being quizz'd and played upon.So having tipped the wink to thoseIn the back rows,Who kept their laughter bottled downUntil our wag should draw the cork,He smiled jocosely on the clown,And went to work.“Well, Farmer Numskull, how go calves at York ? ’“ Why—not, Sir, as they do wi’ yon,But on four legs instead of two.”“ Officer !” cried the legal elf,Piqued at the laugh against himself,“ Do, pray, keep silence down below there.Now look at me, clown, and attend,Have I not seen you somewhere, friend?”—“ Yees—very like—I often go there.”“ Our rustic’s waggish—quite laconic,”The Counsel cried, with grin sardonic;—“ I wish I’d known this prodigy,This genius of the clods, when I,On circuit, was at York residing.—Now, Farmer, do for once speak true.Mind, you’re on oath, so tell me, youWho doubtless think yourself so. clever,Are there as many fools as everIn the West Hiding?”“ Why, no, Sir, no; we’ve got our share,Cut not so many as when you were there,”Axok.DANIEL versus DISHCLOUT.from Stevens’ Lecture on Heads, and delivered by Mr. Matthews, atvarious Provincial Theatres.'We shall now consider the law, as our laws are very conjlerable, both in bulk and number, according as the Sta¬ges declare, “ considerandi, considerando, consklerandum fd are not to be meddled with by those that don’t under-md them. Law always expressing itself with true gram-iatieal precision, never confounding moods, cases, or gen-trs; except, indeed, when a woman happens to be slain,jen the verdict is always brought in manslaughter. The(sence of the law is altercation, for the law can altercate,ilminate, deprecate, irritate, and go on at any rate. Nowie quintessence of the law has, according to its name, fivehrts:—the first is the beginning, or ineipiendum; the(scond, the uncertainty, or dubitendum; the third delay, orjazzleendum; fourthly, replication without endum; and,jfthly, nostrum and horeudum. All which are exemplified11 the following case:—i Daniel against Dishclout—Daniel was groom in theume family wherein Dishclout was cook-maid; and Danielleturning borne one day fuddled, he stooped down to take aop out of the dripping-pan; Dishelout pushed him into the] (ripping-pan, which spoiled his clothes, and he was advisedo bring his action against the cook-maid, the pleadings of(hich were as follows:—The first person who spoke was Mr.ierjeant Snuffle; he began by saying, “Since I have the■ mnour to be pitched upon to open this case to your Lord-hip, I shall not impertinently presume to take up any ofyour Lordship’s time by a round-about circumlocutory■Banner of speaking or talking, quite foreign to the purpose,and not any way relating to the matter in hand! I shfiiwill, I design to show what damages my client has sustaifchereupon, whereupon, and thereupon. Now, my Lord,Hoclient being a servant in the same family with Dishclout, nnot being at board wages, imagined he had a right to.pifee simple of the dripping pan ; therefore he made an attalinent on the sop with his right hand, which the defenqttreplevied with her left hand, tripped us up, and tumblecM'into the dripping pan. Now, in Broughton’s Reports, SIversus Smallwood, it is said that primus strocus sine jcabsolutus est provokus; now, who gave the primus stroc 'who gave the first offence ? Why, the cook; she brouthe dripping-pan there; for, my Lord, though we will allif we had not been there tve could not have been thre< down there; yet, my Lord, if the dripping-pan had not bthere for us to have tumbled down into, we could not h;tumbled down into the dripping-pan.”The next counsel on the same side began with, “1Lord, he who makes use of many words to no purpose, Inot much to say for himself; therefore I shall come to iEoint at once, and immediately I shall come to the poily client was in liquor; the liquor in him having servedejectment upon his understanding, common sense was nonsuit'and he was a man beside himself, as Dr. Biblibus declares,:his Dissertation upon Bumpers. In the 130th folio volumethe Abridgment of the Statutes, page 1286, he says, thatdrunken man is homo duplicans, or a double man, not orbecause he sees things double, but also because he is not !he should be, perfecto ipse he, but is, as he should not ldefeclo tipse he."The counsel on the other side rose up gracefully, playilwith his ruffles prettily, and tossing the tyes of his wig abo-emphatically. He began with, “ My Lud. and you gentl imen of the jury, I humbly do conceive I have the authorvto declare, that I am counsel in this case for the defendamtherefore, my Lud, I shall not flourish away in words ; woreare no more than filagree work. Some people may thinthem an embellishment, but to me it is a matter of astonislment how any one can be so impertinent to the detriment «all rudiment; but, my Lud, this is not to be looked tthrough the medium of right and wrong; for the law knowno medium, and right and wrong are but its shadows. Novin the first place, they have called my client’s premiseskitchen. Now, a kitchen is nobody’s premises; a kitchen inot a warehouse nor a washhouse; a brewhouse nor a bakehouse; an outhouse nor an innhouse, nor a dwelling houseany house; no, my Lud, ’tis absolutely and bona fide,ther more nor less than a kitchen; or, as the law more, ;sically expresses, a kitchen is, camera necessaria pro ususkeree, cum saucepannis, stcio pannis, scullero, dressero, coal-y, stovis smokejacko, pro rostandum, boilandum, fn/andum, et. m puddings, mixandum, pro turtle sovpes, calve's head hashi-, cum calipee et calipashibus. But we shall not avail cur¬ves of an alibi, but admit of the existence of a cook-maid;< v, my Lud, we shall take it upon a new ground, and beg■ ew trial, for as they have curtailed our name, from plainry into Moll, I hope the Court will not allow of this; forhey were to allow of mistakes, what would the law do?n-when the law don’t find mistakes, it is the business offlaw to make them.” Therefore the Court allowed themliberty of a new trial; for the law is our liberty, and it isnfipy for us that we have the liberty to go to law.THE GOUTY MERCHANT.In Broad-Street Buildings, on a winter night,Snug by his parlour fire, a gouty wightSat all alone with one hand rubbingHis leg roll’d up in fleecy hose,While t’other held beneath his noseThe Public Ledger, in whose columns grubbing,He noted all the sales of hops,Ships, shops, and slops,Gum, galls, and groceries, ginger, gin,Tar, tallow, turmeric, turpentine, and tin ;—When lo 1 a decent personage in blackEnter’d, and most politely said,—“ Your footman, sir, has gone his nightly trackTo the King’s Head,And left your door ajar, which IObserv’d in passing by.And thought it neighbourly to give you notice.”“ Ten thousand thanks—how very few get,In time of danger,Such kind attentions from a stranger!Assuredly that fellow’s throat isDoom’d to a final drop at Newgate;He know’s, too, the unconscionable elf,That there’s no soul at home except myself.”“Indeed !” replied the stranger, looking grave;“ Then he’s a double knave:He knows that rogues and thieves by scoresNightly beset unguarded doors;And see how easily might oneOf these domestic foes,Even beneath j-onr very nose,Perform his knavish tricks,—Enter your room as I have done,Blow out your candles—thus—and thus—Pocket your silver candlesticks,And walk oft'—thus.So said—so done—he made no more remark,Nor waited for replies,But march’d off with his prize,Leaving the gouty merchant in the dark.THE TOE.Once on a time—no matter when—Whether of recent date, or long ago,—A Potentate, the pride of British men,Pelt direful twinges in his royal toe;And quick consulted his physiciansUpon the cause of the complaint,Which certainly was bad enough to rex a saint,Or make a lady faint.Ay, or a Parson swear, if giv’n to wrathful ebullitions,Not that I mean to say, this truly greatAnd all-accomplish’d PotentateDid ever swear—far be it from my tongueTo do such mildness and such virtue wrong;Oh, no ! he merely said in accents mild,(Nay, some assert that, while he spoke, he smiled,)So very patiently he bore the pain,“ Dear Doctor I am very ill,The very d l’s in me, I believe;My toe! my toe!—exert your utmost skill,And find out something that will quick relieve,For, oh! the gout has seized my toe again.”The doctor, as in duty bound, look'd sad,And stooping low,Peep’d at the toe,Then felt the pulse of his right royal master;“ Indeed,” said he, “ your Majesty is bad,And pain, we know, will drive a wise man mad,But your complaint is not the gout.”—“ Indeed!”—“ Oh ! no; I’ve found it out.And speedily I will apply a plaster.Meanwhile, with your permission,I’ll show the cause of all your pain,And trust it never can occur again,If you’ll be guided by your old physician.Your shoes have been too tight—too tight by half,So that you’ve quite compress’d your royal toes,And giv’n a wrong directionTo the corneous substance call’d the nail;Now, as your toes support so large a calf,’Tis evident upon reflection,That the corneous substance inward grows,And must be rooted out, or else we fail—The fact is, sire!That men of goodly size and certain agesMust not aspireTo pass for youths in ladies’ eyes,—It ne’er will do—therefore, be wise,And leave such dandy tricks to boys and pages.”Anon.LOVE SICK WILLY.•One Willy Wright who kept a store,But nothing kept therein,Save earthen jugs, and some few kegsOf whisky, ale, and gin—Grew sick, and often would exclaim,“ O how my poor heart burns 1 ”And every week the poor man lived,He had a weakly turn.Now, when they saw him thus decline,Some said that death must come;Some wondered what the ail could be,Some said his ail was rum!At last the very cause was knownOf every pang he felt;Remote, at one end of the town,Miss Martha Townsend dwelt.rll vtjett21 “ ,bjaa_ io'bwoaI,fciiii)A portly, love-resisting dame,Contemptuous, proud, and haughty;But yet, tho’ “fat, and forty,” too,She was not two-and-forty.And Willy long had sought and sighed,To gain this pretty maid;“ I have no trade,” said he, “ so, sure,My love can’t be betrayed.”To Martha, then, he trembling went,And said, “ My dear, ’tis true,Though I have nothing in my store,I’ve love iu store for you.“And if thou wilt, thou may’st become—”But here his tongue was tied;And then she bridled up, and said,She ne’er would be his bride.Then, turning Willie out of doors,She said, “ Go, go along;I hate the man who’s always Wright,Yet always doing wrong.”“I leave you, then,” said be: “farewell 1Of peace I’m now bereft;If I am always right and wrong,You must be right—and left.”So then he closed his little store.Shut up his door and blind;And settled his accounts, and died,And left no Will behind. M.RICHARD AND BETTY AT HICKLETON FAIR.As I waur ganging out last Sat’day neet to buy half-apound o’ bakon, who shon’d I meet but my old sweet-heart,Betty Hunt, un she said, ‘‘Aye, Richard, be that thou,” un Isaid, “ Ees, sure it be," un she said, “ Richard, wudn’t thee beganging to Hickleton Vair at morrow?” and I said, “Inowd’nt not, haply I mought,” and Betty la'aught; and Isaid, “ I wou’d,” and I did, and I went to Hickleton Vair.And so in morning I gotten up and pntten on my bestloen, clogen shoen ware out at fashion then, and I wentink ma clank, clink ma clank, all t’ way to townend, andirst I seed were Betty, standing at her vather's door, wi’ro chaps hanging on either haarm, un I felt all over in sikeconflagration, all my blood gotten into ma knuckles—oh,d a nation good mind to gi’en a bat o’t’ chops, for Bettyiok na notice of me; so I stared at her, but she minded not: so I nudged her at elbow, un she said, “ Aye, Richard, belat thou?” and I said, “Ees sure it be;” and she said,Richard, wou’dn’t thee come into house,” and I said, “ Ees,wou'd,” and I did, and I went into house; and there werevary many people, vary many indeed, and Betty said,Richard, wou’dn't thee have a drap o’ sum’mat t’ drink?”id I said, Ees, I wou’d,” and I did, and I had a drap o’im’mat t’ drink, and I la'af’d, and wur vary merry, varyerry indeed; and Betty said,—“Richard, wou’dn’t theemg us a song?” and I said, “ Ees, I wou’d,” and I did, and/.jaunted a steave—The clock had struck, I can’t tell what,But the morn came on as grey as a rat,The cocks and hens from their roosts did fly,Grunting pigs too had left their stye.Down in a vale,Carrying a pail,Cicely was met by her true love HarryVurst they kiss’t,Then shook fist,And lok’d like two fools just going to many.ye, I remember vary weel that war the vurst song I ever,mg Betty Hunt, and she said, “ thee'd sing us another song”; -aye, I remember vary weel that waur the last song I ever. ing poor Betty; un at last I said, “ I must be ganging,etty,” and I said, “Thee’d cum and see ma summat wayihoam,” and she said she would, and she did, and she sec’de a bit, ’ut way—all the way to townend; and I said,Betty, thee’d gi’us a buss, wou’dn’t thee,” and she said,js, she wou’d, and she did, and she giv’d me a buss. “ Weel,tetty, thee’t let me cum and see thee at morrow neet,” andle said, “ an thee wo't, Richard;” so I gang mysen whoamid gotten to bed, and went at morrow neet to meet Betty—ight o’clock and na Betty—nine o’clock, ten o'clock, and naI etty—eleven, twelve o'clock, and na Betty ; so I tho’t I’dtug mysen whoam; so, in the morning I were told poorI etty wur very badly, very badly indeed, and she had sent41to sec ma ; so I "went to see poor Betty, and she said,“ Richard, if I shou’d dee, thee’d goo to my burying, wou’dn'thee?” and I said, I nowd’nt not, haply I mought, so I saifI vvou’d, and I did, and I went to her burying, for poor Bettydeed; and I ne’er goo through Hickleton churchyard with ¬out dropping a tear to the memory of poor Betty Hunt.THE THRIVING TRADESMEN.When a couple of broom-men had chatted one dayOn a number of things in a sociable way,A new subject they started. Says Jack, “My friend Joe,I have long been most plaguedly puzzled to knowHow you manage to sell your brooms cheaper than mine,As I steal the materials.”—“I like your design,”Replied Joe; “but improvement’s the soul of a trade:All the brooms I dispose of, I steal ready made.”THE LADIES’ PETITION.Dear Doctor, let it not transpireHow much your lectures we admire;How at your eloquence we wonder,When you explain the cause of thunder,Of lightning, and of electricity,With so much plainness and simplicity;The origin of rocks and mountains,Of seas and rivers, lakes and fountains:Of rain and hills, and frost and snow,And all the storms and winds that blow;Besides a hundred wonders more,Of which we never heard before.But now, dear Doctor, not to flatter,There is a most important matter,A matter which you never touch on,A matter which our thoughts run much on;A subject, if we right conjecture,That well deserves a long, long lecture,Which all the ladies would approve—The Natural History of Love !Deny us not, dear Doctor Moyce:0 list to our entreating voice!  1 DTell us why our poor tender heartsSo easily admit love’s darts.Teach us the marks of love's beginning,"What makes us think a beau so winning,What makes us think a coxcomb witty,0A black coat wise, a red coat pretty;Why we believe such horrid lies.That we are angels from the skies,Our teeth like pearl, our cheeks like roses,Our eyesTike stars, such charming noses!Explain our dreams, awake or sleeping,Explain our blushing, laughing, weeping,Teach us, dear Doctor, if you can, °To humble that proud creature, Man ;To turn the wise ones into fools,The proud and insolent to tools ;To make them all run helter skelter,Their necks into the marriage halter:Then leave us to ourselves with these,We’U turn and rule them as we please.Dear Doctor, if you grant our wishes,We promise you five hundred kisses;And, rather than the affair be blundered,We’ll give you six score to the hundred.THE BACHELOR’S SOLILOQUY.To wed, or not to wed ?—that is the question,Whether ’tis nobler in the mind to sutlerThe stings and arrows of outrageous love,Or to take arms against the pow’rful flame,And by opposing, quench it. To wed—to marry—No more—and by a marriage say we endThe heart-ache, and the thousand painful shocksLove makes us heir to—'tis a consummationDevoutly to be wish’d!—to wed—to marry—To marry—perchance a scoW—ay, there’s the rub :Eor in that wedded life what ills may come,When we have shuffled oft’ our single state,Must give us serious pause—there’s the respectThat makes the Bachelors a num’rous race For who would bear the dull, unsocial hoursSpent by unmarried men—cheer’d by no smile,To sit like hermit at a lonely boardIn silence ?~who would bear the cruel gibesio'IaWith which the Bachelor is daily teased.When he himself might end such heart-felt griefsBy wedding some fair maid ? O ! who would liveYawning and staving sadly in the five,Till celibacy becomes a wmavy life,But that the dvead of something after wedlock(That undiscovev’d state from whose strong chainsNo captive can get free) puzzles the will.And makes us rather choose those ills we have,Than fly to others which a wife may bring?Thus caution does make Bachelors of us all,And thus our natural wish for matrimonyIs sicklied o’er with the pale cast of thought—And love-adventures of great pith and momentWith this regard their currents turn awry,And miss the name of wedlock.THE L A N D S HIP W R E C K.This gentleman and IPass’d but just now by your next neighbour’s house,Where, as they say, dwells one young Lionel,An unthrift youth—his father now at sea;And there this night was held a sumptuous feast.In the height of their carousing, all their brainsWarm’d with the heat of wine, discourse was offeredOf ships and storms at sea; when suddenly,Out of his giddy wildness, one conceivesThe room wherein they quaff’d to be a pinnace,Moving and floating, and the confus’d noiseTo be the murmuring winds, gust, marinersThat their unsteadfast footing did proceedProm rocking of the vessel. This conceiv’d,Each one begins to apprehend the danger,And to look out for safety. Fly, saith one,Up to the main-top, and discover. HeClimbs by the bed-post to the tester, thereReports a turbulent sea and tempest towards;And wills them, if they’ll save their ship and lives,To cast their lading overboard. At thisAll fall to work, and hoist into the street,As to the sea, what next came to their hand,Stools, tables, tressels, trenchers, bedsteads, cups,Pots, plate, and glasses. Here a fellow whistles;They take him for the boatswain: one lies struggling17Upon the floor, as if he swam for life:A third takes the bass-viol for the cock-boat,Sits in the belly on’t, labours, and rows;His oar the stick with which the fiddler play’d:A fourth bestrides his fellow, thinking to ’scape(As did Arion) on the dolphin’s back,■ Still fumbling on a gittern. The rude multitude,Watching without, and gaping for the spoilCast from the windows, went by th’ ears about itThe constable is call’d t’ atone the broil;Which done, and hearing such a noise withinOf imminent shipwreck, enters the house, and finds themIn this confusion: they adore his staff.And think it Neptune’s Trident; and that heComes with his Tritons (so they call’d his -watch,)To calm the tempest, and appease the waves ;And at this point we left them TOBY TOSSPOT.Alas! what pity ’tis, that regularity,Like Isaac Shove’s, is such a rarity 1But there are swilling wights in London town.Term’d, Jolly Dogs—Choice Spirits—alias Swine;Who pour, in midnight revel, bumpers down,Making their throats a thoroughfare for wine.These spendthrifts, who life’s pleasures thus outrun,Dosing, with headaches, till the afternoon,Lose half men’s regular estate of sun,By borrowing too largely of the moon.One of this kidney, Toby Tosspot bight.Was coming from the Bedford, late at night;And being Bacchiplems, full of wine,Although he had a tolerable notion,Of aiming at progressive motion,’Twas not direct, 'twas serpentine,He work’d, with sinuosities, along,Like Monsieur Corkscrew, worming thro’ a cork;Not straight, like Corkscrew’s proxy—stiff Don Prong,A fork.At length, with near four bottles in his pate,He saw the moon shining on Shove’s brass plate,When reading, “ Please to ring the hellAnd being civil, beyond measure,‘‘Ring it!” says Toby, “ very well!I’ll ring it with a deal of pleasure.”Toby, the kindest soul in all the town,Gave it a jerk, that almost jerk’d it down.He waited full two minutes—no one came;He waited full two minutes more ; and then,Says Toby, “ If he’s deaf, I’m not to blame!i’ll pull it for the gentleman again.”But the first peal woke Isaac in a fright;Who, quick as lightning popping up his head,Sat on his head’s antipodes in bed,Pale as a parsnip, bolt upright.At length he wisely to himself did say,Calming his fears—“Tush! ’tis some fool has rung, and ran away,”When peal the second rattled in his ears.Shove jump’d into the middle of the floor;And, trembling at each breath of air that stirr’d,He grop’d down stairs, and opened the street door,While Toby was performing peal the third!Isaac eyed Toby, fearfully askaunt,And saw he was a strapper—stout and tall;Then put this question—“ Pray, Sir, what d’ye want ? ’Says Toby—“ I want nothing, Sir, at all.”“ Want nothing? Sir! you’ve pull'd my bell, I vow.As if you’d jerk it off the wire 1 ”Quoth Toby—gravely making him a bow—“I pull’d it, Sir, at your desire.”“At mine?”—“Yes, yours!—I hope I’ve d#ne it well!High time for bed, Sir !—I was hastening to it;But if you write up—‘ Please to ring the bell,’Common politeness makes me stop and do it.”THE FARMER’S BLUNDER.A Farmer once to London wentTo pay the worthy Squire his rent;He comes, he knocks, soon entrance gains—Who at the door such guest detains?Forth struts the Squire exceeding smart;“ Farmer, you’re welcome to my heart;You’ve brought my rent, then.”—“To a hair.”“ The best of tenants, I declare.”The steward’s call’d, accounts made even,And money paid, receipt is given.“Well,” quoth the Squire, “you now shall stayAnd dine with me, old friend, to-day :I’ve here some ladies, wond’rous pretty,And pleasant sparks, too, that will fit thee;”Hob scratch’d his ears, and held his hat,And said, “ No, zur, two words to that,For look, d’ye zee, when I’ze to dineWith gentlefolk zo cruel fine,I’ze use to make (and ’tis no wonder)In deed or word some plaguy blander;Zo, if your honour will permit,I’ll with your zarvants pick a bit.”“ Pho,” says the Squire, “ it sha’nt be done,”And to the parlour push’d him on.To all around Hob nods and scrapes,Not waiting-maid or butler ’scapes;With often bidding takes his seat,But at a distance mighty great:Tho’ often ask’d to draw his chair,He nods, nor comes an inch more near.By madam serv’d with body bended,With knife and fork, and arms extended,He reached as far as he was nble,To plate that overhung the table:With little morsels cheats his chops.And in the passage some he drops;To show where most his heart inclin’d,He talked and drank to John behind.When drank to in the modish way,“Your love’s sufficient, zur,” he’d sayjAnd to be thought a man of manners,Still rose to make his awkward honours.“ Pish,” says the Squire, “ pray keep your sitting.”“No, no,” Hob cries, “zur, ’tis not fitting;Tho’ I’m no scholard, vars’d in letters,I knaws my duty to my betters.”Much mirth the Farmer’s ways afford,And hearty laughs go round the board.Thus the first course was ended well,But at the next, ah, what befel!The dishes now were timely plac'd,And table with fresh luxury grac’d.When drank to by a neigb’nng charmer,Up, as was usual, stands the Farmer.A wag, to carry on the joke,Thus to the servant softly spoke,—“ Come hither, Dick, step gently there,And pull away the Farmer’s chair.”’Tis done, his congee made, the clownDraws back, and stoops to sit him down ;But by posteriors overweigh’d,And of his trusty seat betray’d,As men at twigs in river sprawling.He seiz’d the cloth to save his falling.In vain: sad fortune! down he wallow’d,And, rattling, all the dishes follow'd.The foplings lost their little wits,Tho ladies squall’d, some fell in fits;Here tumbled turkies, tarts, and widgeons,And there minc'd pies, and geese, and pigeons;A pear-pie on his belly drops,A custard pudding meets his chops.Zounds, what ado ’twixt belles and beaux!Some curse, some cry, and wipe their clothes.This lady raves, and that looks down,And weeps and wails her spatter'd gown:One spark bemoans his greased waistcoat,One “ Rot him,” cries, ‘Tie’s spoil’d my lac’d coat.”Amidst the rout, the Farmer longThe pudding suck’d and held his tongue,At length he gets him on his breech,And scrambles up to make his speech ;Scrapes eyes, and mouth and nostril twangs,Then smacks his fingers, and harangues,“Plague tak’t—I’ze told ye how ’twou’d be,Luck, here’s a pickle, zur, d'ye see?And zome, I’ll warrant, that makes this chatter,Have clothes bedaub’d with grease and batter,*d21That cost”—He had gone on, but hereAVas stopt at once in his career.“ Peace, brute! begone,” the ladies cry.The beaux exclaim, “ Ply, rascal, fly! ”“ I'll tear his eyes out,” squeaks Miss Dolly,I'll pink his soul out,” roars a bully.At this the farmer sweats through fear,And thinking ’twas ill tarrying here,Steals off, and cries, “Ay, kill me, then,AVhene’cr you catch me here again.”So home he jogs, and leaves the SquireTo cool the sparks, and ladies’ ire.Thus ends my tale, and now I’ll tryLike Prior, something to apply.This may teach rulers of a nation,Ne’er to place men above their station;And this may show the wanton wit,That whilst he bites he may be bit.BILLY DIP.Chloe, a maid at fifty-five,AVas at her toilette dressing;Her waiting-maid, with iron hot,Each paper’d curl was pressing.The looking-glass her eyes engross,AVhile Betty humm’d a ditty;She gazed so much upon her face,She really thought it pretty.Her painted cheeks and pencil browsShe could not but approve;Her thoughts on various subjects turn’d,At length they fixed on love.“ And shall,” said she, “ a virgin lifeAwait these pleasing charms?And will no sighing blooming youthReceive me to his arms?—Forbid it, Love! ” She scarce had spoke,AVhen Cupid laid a trap;22For at the chamber door was heardA soft and gentle rap:Cried Betty, “ Who is at the door ? ”“ Ay, tell,” quoth Chloe, “ trueWhen straight a tender voice replied,“ Dear ma’am, I dye for you.”“ What’s that! ” she said, “ 0, Betty, say!A man ! and die for me!And can I see the youth expire—O, no!—it must not be !“ Haste, Betty—open quick the doorTis done; and, lo! to view,A little man with bundle stood,In sleeves and apron blue.“Ye powers!” cried Chloe, “what is this?What vision do I see!Is this the man, O mighty Love—The man that dies for me ?”“ Yes, ma’am; your ladyship is right,”The figure straight replied;“ And hard for me it would have beenIf I had never dyed.“ La! ma’am, you must have heard of me,Although I’m no highflyer;I live just by at No. 1,I’m Billy Dip, the dyer.“ ’Twas I, ma’am, Betty there employedTo dye your lustring gown ;And I not only dye for you.But dye for all the town.”THE TWO STAMMERERS.While others fluent verse abuse,And prostitute the Comic muse;In less indecent manner, IHer Comic Ladyship will try.230 let my prayer, bright maid, prevail JGrant inspiration to my tale!A tale both comical and new,And with a swinging moral, too!In a small quiet country townLived Bob; a blunt, but honest clown:Who, spite of all the school could teach,From habit, stammer’d in his speech;And second nature, soon, we’re sure,Confirm’d the case beyond a cure.Ask him to say, Hot rolls and butter;“ A hag-a-gag, and splitter-splutter”Stopp’d every word he strove to utter.It happened once upon a time—1 word it thus to suit my rhyme;For all our country neighbours knowIt can’t be twenty years ago.—Our sturdy ploughman, apt to strike,Was busy delving at his dyke;Which, let me not forget to say,Stood close behind a public way:A youth, a stranger in that place,Stood right before him, face to face.“ P-p-p-p-pray,” says he,“ How f-f-f-f-far may’t beTo-o,”—the words would not come out,“ To-o Borough-Bridge, or thereabout ? ” „Our clown took huff; thrice hemm’d upon'!,Then smelt a kind of an affront.Thought he—“This bluff, fool-hardy fellow,A little cracked, perhaps, or mellow,Knowing my tongue an inch too short,Is come to fleer and make his sport:Wauns! if I thought he meant to quarrel,I'd hoop the roynish rascal’s barrel 1If me he means, or dares deride,By all that’s good, I’ll tan his hide!I’ll dress his vile calf's skin in buff,And thrash it tender where ’tis tough.Thus, full resolv’d, he stood aloof,And availed mute, for farther proof.While t’other, in a kind of pain,Applied him to his tongue again—“ Speak, friend ; c-c-c-c-can you, pray,24Sh-sh-sh-sliow me—on my—way?Nay, sp-c-eak!—I’ll smoke thy bacon!You have a t-ongue, or I’m mistaken.”“Yes—that, tii-that I-I-I-have;Pint not for y-y-you—you knave!”“What!” cried the stranger, “wh-wh-what!Dy’e mock me ? T-t-take yon that! ”“ Hugh ! you mock—me!” quoth Hob amain,“So t-t-take you—that, again!”Then to’t they fell, in furious plight,While each one thought himselfi’ th' right;And, if you dare believe my song,They likewise thought each other wrongThe battle o’er, and somewhat cool—Each half suspects himself a fool;For, when to choler folks incline ’em,Your argumentum baculinum,Administered in dose terrific.Was ever held a grand specific.Each word the combatants now utter’d,Conviction brought, that both dolts stutter’d;And each assum’d a look as stupid,As, after combat, looks Dan Cupid :Each scratch’d his silly head, and thoughtHe’d argue ere again he fought.Hence I this moral shall deduce—Would Anger deign to sign a truceTill Reason could discover truly,Why this mad Madam wore unruly,So well she would explain their words,Men little use could find for swords.THE WAGER DECIDED.Such little hopes I’d always foundOf gaining Betsy for my wife,That I had wagered Dick a pound,I should not win her all my life.But, thanks to heaven! my anxious careIs all removed—the knot is ty’d,And Betsy, fairest of the fair,Consents at length to be my bride.To Dick, then, as in honour bound,Well pleased, I hold myself in debt;Thus, by the oddest luck, ’tis foundI lose my wager, win my Bet.t

CALDWELL.1 842.l>JMLLOftITJ3.< /T. Weel John what do you think is to come out othae terrible times ? I believe our kintra neer saw a timelike this.J. Really they are fearfu’ looking times, and I amreally at a loss what to think about them, or how to pro¬pose a remedy to better them.T. Deed John I’m truly at a loss mysel’ to ken whatwould be the best remedy, but it is plain we would needsome remedy soon, for our miseries are every day increas¬ing, and the starvation and destitution that is amang usis alarming. Hae ye nae idea ava’ what can be the:cause o’ a’ this bankruptcy and beggary that is comeamang us?J. It is often my first thochts in the morning, and thelast at night, to fin’ out the origin o’ a’ this distress;whiles I think the Corn Bill has a great effect to hurt ourtrade, and I hae nae doubt but it has had a bad effect,but how far it would remedy the evil now I’m no very sure,for wi’ us no takin’ their Corn, they wouldna tak’ ourGoods, and noo baith Russia, and Prussia, and Holland,and Belgium, and France, and America, an’ a’, has got¬ten Cotton Mills, and Thread Mills, and lots o’ our Me¬chanics, and they are quite independent o’ us and out-goods. I think our landholders, if they had half an e’ein their head, micht see that.3T. I dinna think ye’re far wrang John, altho' I haveheard some argue strictly in behalf o’ the Corn Bill, andtell us if it wasna the Corn Bill our grun’ wadna be saeweel cultivated, and its value wad sink in estimation, hutI rather think the lads up by are feart the rents wad sinkin their estimation; and is this a’the relief John—thetakiu* aft' o’ the Corn Laws—that we hae to look for, forthe bettering o’ our condition ? if this is a’ it is a veryforlorn hope.J. I hae nae doubt Thomas but there is ither causesthat produce these great grievances amang us. Anithergreat cause, I believe, is our great National Debt, whichhangs about our neck like a millstane, and I’m afraidwill sink us to the bottom if the string is not cut, andwhat surprises me maist is to see sae little attention paidto economy, to help to pay off this debt. It is grievin’to read o’ the thousands, and thousands, and hunders o’thousands, that is payt awa’ every year to placemen andpensioners, for no purpose under the sun, but rankwastery; ane wad think, when they see our kintra sinkin’and sae muckle need for care, that they would be glad toadopt any plan to save us; and they ha’e a capital patterno’ cheap government laid down to them in America, wharthe head o’ the house costs them only £6000 instead o’£400,000, which some folk has to pay.T I must confess John you talk very reasonably onthe subject, and if your plans could be brought to work,they micht hae a gude effect; but there is a heap o’ folkthinks that if we had the Charter it would work a won-derfu’ Reform amang us, and that we woald get a’ ourevils set to right in a short time, hut I’m afraid it willnot be easy gotten to mak’ a trial o’.J. I daresay there would be a change, if that could hegotten, but, as ye say, I doubt it will not be gotten in ahurry, but I should like to see’t try’t, and see what effectit wad hae to Reform matters; but there is ae Reform4that we a' hae in our power, and I think every living maiami woman should mak* a trial o’t to see what effect iwad liae, there’s naebody 1 speak to but confesses thathere is a world of evils in connection with it, and fothat reason I think it is our duty to try it, and that is t<abstain from all intoxicating drinks, and I cannot thin?that any man can he a sincere Chartist or Reformer, unless he be a Teetotaler, for the drinking o’ thae drinkicompletely counteracts his own schemes.I. Ah, noo John, are ye really gaun to tak a’ thuhair o' comfort us puir bodies hae left? if it wasna for tludribble o’ dram I get noo and than, I wad sink uu’er myaffliction athegither; ye cenna deny I’m sure but it raisesthe spirits and mak’s us cheery rnony a time, when nadither thing will do’t.J. O yes, Thomas, I must confess it raises the spirits,!and that to an awfu’ degree, sometimes to 80, but next,morning you will find them sink to 40, being 20 belowpar, and then what state do ye fin’ yoursel’ in ? do yefin’ your purse ony benter? do ye fin your head ony heal¬er? your character ony better, or your conscience onysounder, after wallowing in that sinfu’ drink? I trow no,Thomas.T. Tuts man ye’re takin’ the very warst look o’ thething ye can tak*; its weel enough kent there’s mony aane tak’s a bit suck that disna drive themsel’s to thae ex¬tremities ye talk about, our Ministers, and Elders, andMagistrates, and Councillors too; indeed, the maist o’folk that reckon themsel’s upish can a’ tak’ their moder¬ate dram and no tin to excess.J. Their moderate dram ! dinna tell me about moder¬ate drams, I ken baith Ministers, and Elders, and Magis¬trates too, that hae gaen far aglee wi’ their moderation,but independent o’ a’ that, is’t no a shamfu* bad examplethey set before workin’ folk, (for poor folk maun aye beimitating the rich if they can ava) to drink thae drinks5hat destroy sre muckle o’ our grain in times like this,vhen poor folk’s starvin’; every half nmtcliin ye drink,Thomas, believe me or no as ye like, destroys as muckle;ude good as wad mak’ a comfortable meal to a gude bigamily, and I’m creditably informed that there is as muchlestroyed in one distillery every morning as wad break-ast the hale town o’ Paisley.T. Hoot, nonsence, John ye’re surely gaun out o’t nooithegither, I never ilream’t o’ ony thing like that, ye wadTiaist fricht a body frae ever tasting a drap again ; if that(Vas the ease ye wad think the hale kintra wad rise up ini mass against it, our legislators wad stop distillation, andi>ur magistrates wad grant nae mae licenses. Hoot tootlohn, ye’re surly far wrangJ. No, tweel awat Thomas, I’m nane wrang, for ifhere was nane o’ the drunkard’s drink drucken, everyhhahitant in Scotland micht hae sax pound o’ bread everyveek they hinna, and that’s hut ae portion o’ the evil thatprings frae that curse ; look to the misery and madness,he woes and wretchedness, that it produces; we re tax’do a pretty degree even noo to support piisons like bastile«,vhereas if we wrd a’ drap drinking, a three-storey house|vad ha’d a’ the criminals in a kintra side.T. Altho’ there a wheen fools that mak’ themsel’s idiotsvi’ drinkin’, were no a’ to be blamed wi t; there’s mony. decent respectable minister and magistrate bait!.] that tak’heir dram, and disna All themsel’s fou, and if folk wadmly imitate their example there wad be nae great fear o’;aun wrang.J- Ah, Thomas, Thomas, hut it is a had examplescripture aye approves o’ them that tak’ nae drink, andcould gie ye plenty o’ instances o’t if you and I hadime ; and to finish the whole story, it declares to you, inlahakuk, in plain terms no to he misunderstood, “ Woea him that giveth his neighbour drink.” The beginning6to drink is something like beginning to smoke or snuff,is fun at first, but truly it often grows earnest, as we rnoia time see; and I think, for my part, its far better to Jit alane a’ thegither; and I think it is the duty of eve1patriot and every Christian to give no countenance to thevile things ; and every man that drinks intoxicating liquis only assisting to support 40,000 men who break eveLord’s day, by destroying the bounties of Providence, 1converting them into a most destructive and perniciodrink. And I think that a man that would not gie »the use o’ a thing that is baith useless and unnecessaifor the sake o’ his suffering fellow creatures, is nae m;ava.T. Ye really gang a great length wi’ your teetotalisiye seem to think it will be a general salve for a’ the ditresses and sufferings with which we are afflicted; butdoubt, John, tho’ we were a’ teetotlars the nicht, it wad;better our condition a bawbee, in the present awfu’ stao’ things; we're gae an’ weed teetotal’d the noo, and tbsair against our wills.J. Nae thanks to you for that kin’ o’ teetotalism, thatno the genuine principle; besides, I am sure, if we waa’ pledged, and sterling to the cause, we wad soon seedifferent state o’ things, for 1 am quite convinced it wabe a general salve for a’ our distresses. In the first placit would prevent 45 millions bushels of good grain fro-being destroyed every year, which would have a gretendency to cheapen our food, enabling us to manufactuour goods at a cheaper rate, and to cope with other n;tions, and completely put a check to the evil workingsthe Corn Bill; and besides all this, the miseries aicrimes, the misfortunes and calamities, the lunacy ansuicide, the Sabbath desieration and a thousand other evilwould almost entirely vanish from among us.T. Really John, ye seem to hae’t a’ by the back, anI must con fess, there’s a good deal o’ truth in what yIly; but what wad become o’ our puir revenue if wefere a' to drap drinking, there wad be a bonny cry outlen, for we hae facbt enough to get the win’ rais’d as itJ. Weel Thomas, to be plain wi’ you, I think theinira is quite blin’ on that subject; I ken vera weel weae great revenue aff drink, nae less than 16 millions, butoik never tbink o’ the frightsome expense that thaeiquors bring on us, mair I believe, than a’ they produce,see the tremendous Jails, Hospitals, and Asylums we haeb support; see the Judges, the Sheriffs, the Fiscals, andhe awful army o’ Policemen we hae to pay; see theCriminals we hae to feed; the host o’ Witnesses andsawyers which must be paid for prosecutions and trials;nd the enormous sums levied from us in the characterif Rogue Money and Prison Money; see the thousands•aid for support of our criminal Colonies, for Freight of/essels to send them to these Colonies no less than 86000leing paid last year for that purposethen say whetherir not our country is benefitted by the revenue producedrom these destructive drinks.T. I really must confess, John, you have almost madene a Total Abstainer, and I do now consider it my dutyogive nae langer ony countenance to thae vile drinks;>ut I think we hae rather gaen aff the point a wee; wevere talking about dull trade, and the causes o’t: yeurely dinna think that drinking has been the cause o’ saenony bankruptcies amang us, to crack our credit, derange>ur business, and cause sic an unparalelled stagnation o’;rade.J. Deed Thomas, I dinna think we were the least aff-he point about the cause o’ our dull trade, for I hinnadie least doubt in my mind, but drinking is the cause o’x’ this wretchedness we’re labouring under; for, indepen-lent o' the great sums o’ money squandered awa’ on guz¬zling, and drinking, and gambling, w hich sums micht haekoppit mony a Bark Bill, I hae nae doubt bet mony iatte o' tliae Win’ Bills were drawn and accepted under tbinfluence o’ the Bowl; and I am quite sat'sSed that if :our trading men had been teetotalers for ten years bad-there would neither have been dull trade nor bankruptcieamang us ; and our present sufferings are only a just judgement for a’ our sinfu’ drinkings and horrid abominatiorthat spring from that source; and so wide is the eveffects of the drinking system, that it has seized upoalmost every fibre of commerce, and so long as Alcoholidrinks are encouraged and countenanced by the upperanks of society, and by our Ministers and MagistrateI never expect to see things much better, for all classesink under its demoralizing influence. Our Cabin<Ministers, our Pulpit Ministers, our highest gifted Liteiary Men, down to our humblest Artisans, all have suffeied, all have gone astray through strong drink. I wi«you a good night, Thomas—I hope you’ll go to-morroiand sign the Pledge, and 1 trust we’ll soon see bettctimes.T. Good night John.

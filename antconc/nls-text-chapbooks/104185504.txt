I’m truly sorry,To think on Robin’s sweetheart Jenny;As Hah and her were gaun fu’ douce,Counting what things w ad serve the house,And wba they wad hae at their wadding,And how they should na see the bedding,And what new things they baith were needing,And how sic and sic lass was breeding;And what they wad ca’ their first bairn,Aud how they’d lie in ither’s anas;And wonert if young fewk thought shameWhen to the bridal bed they came.But twa’r three chaps saw Rab's resortFrae field o’ Mars to Venus’ sport;And thought he had been rather bardie,By wounding some ane o’ their party,And thought this was a famous omen,When only guarded by a woman:Then after him they went with speed,And made a league to be his dead.And swoor that if he was na fell’dHe might depend on being geld’;So without any farther switber,They founder’d him o’er Jenny’s shouther.Och! how poor Jenny’s heart was beating.To think that Rah wad be a capon,And, like Eloise in her letter,She curs’d that awfu’ bloody weapon;But yet they did na him depriveNeither o’ manhood nor his life,For Rab he cam’ na to the grun.But wheel’d about and fast did run.And still wi* Jenny in his arms,Wi’ murder cries the rest alarms,Wha still were thrang on baith the sides.And pelting ane anither’s hides.By this time them that did Rab fright.Had ta’en the road, and out of sight,And into some house straight they fled,And snugly lay beneath a bed,7'Then sic a search an<f sit a running.But faith the lads were past their fin ing;Wi’ speed they ran frae house to house,Just as a cat would hunt a mouse,And mony windows and good doors,Lay a’ in smash upon the floors;But in the midst o' a’ this gurie;Great numbers fled hame in a hurry.Some was wi’ fighting clean outworn.And some set tryst to meet the morn;And some that had na tried their baa’,Set tryst to meet just man to man;But as they could naseeto fight.They'd let it stand till they’d get light.So the nest morning wi’ the sun.There were ten score upon tho grun,On ev’ry side ye’d see them rinning.Wi’ buttocks bare just in their linen;For when they got the first alarm.They took their breeks below their arm;And there was ane gaun to his warkWas very near hand made a corp.For twa’r three lads did him attack.Arid soon they laid him on his back.And wad his life ta'en on the spot,Had not his father ta'en him up.Then on the green the ring was made.To try wha had the stoutest hide.But there was ane wi’ meikle sense,Ban in and- thought the daaac to 03;each,8Ami ulion he had ae pair admonisli’d,He turn’d about and was astonish'dTo see some mair there thrang at wark,And laying at it in their sark;So then he thought to.waste his timeWas casting pearls before swine,And then came off without mair study, >■ ^ ,>lConvinc'd that he had done'bis'duty.Wi’this a lad, proud o’ his strength,Appear’d upon the field at length,And challeng’d ony single man *To come out o’er and try his han’;But if his judgment had been soun’,He wad na came to brag a town:But as nae 'prentice w ould him stand,He did na need to try his hand.And it was lucky for his hideThe journeymen they took nae side,For had they been inclin’d to fight.There wad hae been a horrid sight.Wi’ this the bloody burrie ended, - • ■ VAt least tor tometimo is suspended}New ev'ry ane rn.,y pa ch their scars,And iiin'i upon die fate o’ wars,And Vu good will shakeihands wi’ ither,And tak’ a glass ane ’gree thegither.. .

THEMadrid Shaver’sSINGULAR ADVENTURES,ANDWonderful EscapeFROM THE SPANISHINQUISITION.A TRUE STORY.GLASGOW :PRINTED FOR THE BOOKSELLERS.THEMadrid Shaver.Nicolas Psduosa, a busy little being, whowas shaver, surgeon and man-midwife, in the townof Madrid, mounted his mule and pushed throughthe gate of San Bernardino, being call’d to a pa¬tient in a neighbouring village upon a pressingoccasion. Every body knows, ttiat the ladies inSpain, m certain cases, do not give long warningto practitioners of a certain description, andnobody knew it better than Nicolas, who wasresolved not to lose an inch of his way, norof his mule’s best speed by the way, if cudgellingcould beat it out of her. It was plain to Nicolas’sconviction, as plain could be, that his road layStraight forward to the little convent in front; themule w as of opinion, that the turning on the leftdown the hill towards the Prade, was the road ofall roads most familiar and agreeable to herself,and accordingly began to dispute the point withNicolas, by fixing her forefeet resolutely in theground, dipping her head at the same time be¬tween them, and launching heels and crupperfuriously into the air, in the way of argument.Little Pedrosa, who wras armed at heel with onemassy silver spur, of stout though ancient work¬manship, resolutely applied the rusty rowel to theshoulder of the beast, and at the same time, ad¬roitly tucking his blue cap under his right arm,and flinging his skirt over his left shoulder encavalier, began to lay about him wdth a stout ash-4en sapling, upon the ears, pole, and cheeks, ofthe recreant mule. The fire now flashed from apair of Andalusian eyes, as black as charcoal, andnot less inflammable, and taking the cigar fromhis mouth, with which he had vainly hoped tohave regaled his nostrils in a sharp winter’s even¬ing by the way, raised such a thundering troopof angels, saints, and martyrs, from Saint Mic¬hael, downwards, not forgetting his own name¬sake St. Nicolas de Tolentino, by the way, thatif curses could have made the mule to go, the dis¬pute would have been soon ended : but not a saintcould make her stir any other way than upwardsand downwards at a stand. A small troop ofmendicant friars were at this moment conductingthe host to a dying man—‘ Nicolas Pedrosa,’said an old friar, ‘ be patient with your beast, andspare your blasphemies; remember Balaam.’—‘ Ah! father,’ replied Pedrosa, ‘ Balaam cudgelledhis beast till she spoke, so will I mine till sheroars.’—‘ Fie, fie, prophane fellow,’ cries anoth¬er of the fraternity. ‘ Go about your work, friend,’quoth Nicolas, ‘ and let me go about mine; Iwarrant it is the more pressing of the two; yourpatient is going out of the world, and mine iscoming into it.’ Hear him,’ cries a third, ‘ hearthe vile wretch how he blasphemes the body ofGod.’ And then the troop passed slowly on tothe tinkling of the bell.A roan must know nothing of a mule’s ears,who does not know what a passion they have forthe tinkling of a bell; and no sooner had the jung-ling chords vibrated in the sympathetic organsof Pedrosa’s beast, than bolting forward with aasudden spring, she ran roaring into the throngof friars, trampling on some, and shouldering oth¬ers,.at a prophane rate; when Nicolas availinghimself of the impetus, and perhaps not able tocontrol it, broke away, and was out of sight in amoment. _ ‘ All the devils in hell blow fire intothy tail, thou beast of Babylon, muttered Nicol¬as to himself, as he scampered along, never oncelooking behind him, or stopping to apologize forthe mischief he had done to the bare feet andshirtless ribs of the holy brotherhood.Whether Nicolas saved his distance, as like¬wise if he did, whether it was a male or a femaleCostilian he usherd into the world, we shall notjust now enquire, contented to await his returnin the first of the morning, next day, w'hen hehad no sooner dismounted at his shop, and deliv¬ered his mule to a sturdy Arragonese wench, thanDon sgnaciade Santor Aparicio, Alguazil-mayorof the supreme and general Inquisition, put anorder into his hand, signed and sealed by the In¬quisitor-general, for a conveyance of his body tothe Casa, whose formidable door presents itself inthe street adjoining to the square in which Ni-colas’s brazen basin hung from, the emblem of histrade.The poor little fellow, trembling in every joint,and with a face as yellow as saffron, dropt a kneeto the alter which fronts the entrance, and cros¬sed himself most devotely : as soon as he had as¬cended the first flight of stairs, a porter habitedin bkek opened, the tremendous barricade, andNicolas, with horror, heard the grating of theheavy bolts that shut him in. He was led0t hrough passages and vaults, and melancholy cells;till he was delivered into the dungeon, where liewas finally left to his solitary meditations. Hap¬less being; what a scene of horror ! Nicolas feltall the terrors of his condition, but being an An¬dalusian, and, like his countrymen, of a livelyimagination, he began to turn overall the resour¬ces of his invention for happy fetch, if any suchmight occur, for helping him out of the dismallimbo he was in : he had not long to seek for thecause of his misfortune; his adventure with thebarefooted friars was a ready solution of all di;fi-culties of that nature, had there been any ; therewas, however, another thing, which might havetroubled a stouter heart than Nicolas’s—he wasa Jew. this, of a certain, would have been astaggering item in a poor devil s confession, butthen it was a secret to all the world but Nicolas,and Nicolas’s conscience did not then urge himto reveal it. lie now began to overhaul the in¬ventory of his personals about him, and with somesatisfaction counted three little medals of theblessed Virgin, two Agnus Deis, a Saint Nicol¬as de Tolentino, and a formidable string of beads,all pendant from bis neck, and within his shirt;in his pockets he had a paper of dried figs, a smallbundle of cigars, a case of lancets, squirt and for¬ceps, and two old razors in a leathern envelope:these he had delivered one by one to theulgunzil,who first arrested him,—‘ and let them make themost of them,’ said he to himself, ‘ they can nev¬er prove an Israelite by a case of razors.’ Upona closer rummage, however, he discovered in asecret pocket, a letter, which the Alguazil hadoverlooked, and which his patient Donna Leon¬ora de Casafonda had given him in charge to de¬liver as directed. ‘ Well, well,’ cried he, ‘ let itpass; there can be no mystery in this harmlessscrawl; a letter of advice to some friend or rela¬tion ; I’ll not break the seal; let the fathers readit, if they like, ’twill prove the truth of my de¬position, and help out my excuse for the hurryof my errand, and the unfortunate adventure ofa damned refractory mule.’—And now no soonerhad the recollections of the wayward mule cros¬sed the brain of poo* Nicolas Pedrosa; than hebegan to blast her at a furious rate. ‘ The scrat¬ches and the scab to boot confound thy scurvyhide,’ quoth he ‘ thou ass-begotten bastard,whom Noah never let into his ark! The ven¬geance take thee, for an uncreated barren beastof promiscuous generation ! What devil’s crot¬chet got into thy capricous noddle, that thoushouldst fall in love with that Nazaritish bell, andrun bellowing like Lucifer into the midst of thosebarefooted vermine, who were more malicious and-more greedy than the locusts of Egypt? Oh!that 1 had the art of Simon Magus to conjurethee into this dungeon in my stead; but I war¬rant thou art chewing thy barley straw withoutany pity for thy wretched master, whom thy jade’stricks have delivered bodily to the tormentors, tobe sport for these uncircumcised sons ofDagon’And now the cell door opened, when a savagefigure entered, carrying a huge parcel of clank¬ing fetters, with a collar of iron, which he putround the neck of poor Pedrosa, telling hftn,with a truly diabolical grin, whilst he was8rivetting it on, ‘ that it was a proper cravat forthe throat of a blasphemer.’-—Jesus Maria!quoth Pedrosa, ‘ is all this fallen upon me, foronly cudgelling a restive mule ?’ ‘ Aye,’ criedthe demon, ‘ and this is only a taste of what isto come,' at the same time slipping the pincersfrom the screw he was forcing to the head, hecaught a piece of flesh in the forceps, and wrench¬ed it cut of his cheek, laughing at poor Nicolas,whilst he roared out with the pain, telling him‘ it was ajust reward for the torture he had puthim to a while ago, when he tugged out a toothtill he broke it in his jaw.’ ‘ Ah, for the love ofheaven,’ cried Pedrosa, £ have more pity on me;for the sake of Saint Nicolas de Tolentino, myholy patron, be not so unmerciful to a poor bar¬ber-surgeon ; and I will shave your worship’sbeard for nothing as long as I have life.’ Oneof the messengers of the auditory now came in,and bade the fellow strike off the prisoner’s fet¬ters, for that the holy fathers were in council, anddemanded him for examination. ‘ This is some¬thing extraordinary,’ quoth the tormentor, ‘ Ishould not have expected it this twelvemonth tocome.’ Pedrosa’s fetters were struck oft’; somebrandy was applied to staunch the bleeding ofbis cheek; his hands and face were washed, anda short jacket of coarse ticking thrown over him ;and the messenger, with an assistant, taking himeach under an arm, led him into a spacious cham¬ber, where at.the head of a long table sat his ex¬cellency the Inquisidor-general, with six of hisaccessors, three on each side of the chair of state :the Alguazil-mayor, a secretary, and two notaries,9I- with other officers of the holy council, were at-j tending in their places.The. prisoner was placed behind a bar at thefoot of the table, between the messengers whobrought him in; and having made his obesianceto the awful presence, in the most supplicatingmanner, he was called upon, according to theusual form of question, by one of the junior judges,* to declare his name, parentage, profession, age,place of abode, and to answer various interroga¬tories, of the like trifling nature : his Excellencythe Inquisidor-general now opened his reverendlips, and in a solemn tone of voice, that penetrat¬ed to the heart of the poor trembling prisoner,interrogated him as follows:—Nicolas Pedrosa, we have listened to the ac¬count you give of yourself, your business and con¬nections; now tell us for what offence or offences,you are standing a prisoner before us; examineyour heart, and speak the truth from your con¬science without prevarication orylisguise.May it please your excellency replied Pedrosawith all due submission to your holiness and thisreverend assembly, my most equitable judges, Iconceive 1 stand here before you tor no worse acrime than that of cudgeling a refractory mule ananimal so restive in its nature, (under correctionof your holiness be it spoken,) that although Iwere blessed with the forbearance of holy Job,(for like him too I am married and my patiencehath been exercised by a wife,) yet could I notforbear to smite my beast for her obstinacy, andthe rather, because I was summoned in the wayof my profession, as I have already made known10to your most merciful ears, upon a certain cryingoccasion, which would not admit of a moment’sdelay.Recollect yourself, Nicolas, said his Excellen¬cy, the Inquisidor general; was there nothingelse you did, save smiting your beast ?I take Nicholas de Tolentino to witness, re¬plied he, that I know of no other crime, for whichI can be responsible at this righteous tribunal,save smiting my unruly beast. Take notice,brethren, exclaimed the Inquisidor, this unholywretch holds trampling over friars to be no crime.Pardon me, holy father, replied Nicholas Ihold it for the worst of crimes, and therefore sur¬render my refractory mule to be dealt with as yousee fit: and if you impale her alive it will be nomore than she deserves.Your wits are too nimble, replied the judge;have a care they do not run away with your dis¬cretion ; recollect the blasphemies you uttered inthe hearing of tljose pious people.I humbly pray your Excellency, answered theprisoner, to recollect that anger is a short mad¬ness, and I hope allowances will be made byyour holy council for words spoke in haste to arebellious mule : the prophet Balaam was thrownoft’ his guard by a simple ass, and what is an asscompared to a mule? If your Excellency hadseen the lovely creature that wTas screaming inagony till I came to her relief, and how fine aboy I ushered into the world, which would havebeen lost but for my assistance, I am sure I shouldnot be condemned for a few hasty words spokenin passion.11Sirrah ! cried one of the puisne judges, respectthe decency of the court. Produce the contents»f the fellow’s pockets before the court, said thepresident; lay them on the table.Monster! resumed the aforesaid puisne judge,taking up the forceps, what is the use of this■diabolical machine ? Please your reverence, re¬plied Pedrosa, ‘ aptum est ad extrahendos foetus.’— Unnatural wretch, again exclaimed the judge,you have murdered the mother.The mother of God forbid ! exclaimed Pedro¬sa. I believe I have a proof in my pocket thatwill acquit me of that charge, and so saying hetendered the letter we have before made mentionof. The secretary took it, and by command ofthe court read as follows :—“ Senior Don Manuel de Herrerra,“ When this letter, which I send by NicolasPedrosa, shall reach your hands, you will knowthat I am safely delivered of a lovely boy, aftera dangerous labour, in consideration of which Ipray you to pay to the said Nicholas Pedrosathe sum of twenty gold pistoles, which sum hisExcellency— Hold, cried the Inquisitor-generalstarting hastily from his seat, and snatching awaythe letter, there is more in this than meets theeye; break up the court; I must take an exam¬ination of this prisoner in private.As soon as the room wa^ cleared, the Inquisi¬tor-general, beckoning to the prisoner to followhim and retired into a private closet where throw¬ing himself carelessly into an arm chair, he turn¬ed a gracious countenance upon the poor affright¬ed accoucheur, and bidding him sit down upon12a low stool by his side, thus accosted him:—Take heart, Senior Pedrosa, your imprisonmentis not likely to be very tedious, for I have a com¬mission you must execute without loss of time;yoif have too much consideration for yourself, tobetray a trust, the violation of which must involveyou in inevitable ruin, and can in no degree at¬taint my character, which is far enough beyondthe reach of malice; be attentive, therefore, to myorders; execute them punctually and keep mysecret as you tender your own life : dost thouknow the name and condition of the lady whomthou hast delivered ? Nicholas assured him hedid not and his Excellency proeeeeded as follows :Then I tell thee, Nicholas, it is the illustriousDonna Leonora de Casafonda; her husband is thepresident of Quito, and daily expected with thonext arrivals from the South Seas: now, thoughmeasures have been taken for detaining him atthe port, where he shall land, till he shall receivefurther orders, yet you must be sensible DonnaLeonora’s situation is somewhat delicate; it willbe your business to take the speediest measuresfor her recovery; but as it seems she has had adangerous and painful labour, this may be a workof more time than coi ld be wished, unless somemedicines more efficacious, than common are ad¬ministered ; art thou acquainted with any such,friend Nicolas, my posesses have been tolerablysuccessful; I have bandages and cataplasms, withoils and conserves, that I have no cause to com¬plain of; they will restore nature to its properstate in all decent time.—Thou talkest like a fool,friend Nicolas, interrupting him, said the Inquis-13itor ? What tellest thou me of thy swatbings| and swaddlings? quick work must be wroughtI by quick medicine; hast thou none such in thyI botica ? I’ll answer for it thou hast not; there-fi fore, look you, sirrah, here is a little vial com-I pounded by a famous chemist; see that you mix* it in the eext apocem you administer to DonnaLeonora; it is the most capital sedative in nat¬ure ; give her the whole ol it and let her husbandI las within himself, well said Inquisidor 1 HeI took the vial with all possible respect, and was| not wanting in professions of the most inviolable(fidelity and secrecy.—No more words friend Nic¬olas, quoth the Inquisidor, upon that score ; I donot believe thee one jot the more for all thy pro¬mises, my dependence is upon thy fears and not| thy faith; I fancy thou hast seen enoilgh of thisplace not to wish to return to it once for all.Having so said, he rang a bell, and ordered Nic¬olas to be forthwith liberated, bidding the mes¬senger return his clothes instantly to him withall that belonged to him, and having slipt a purseinto his hand well filled with doubloons, he badehim begone about his business, and not see hisface again till he had executed his demands.Nicolas bolted out of the porch without takingleave of the altar, and never checked his speedtill he found himself fairly housed under shelterof his own beloved brass bason Ahal-quofhNicolas, my lord Inquisidor, I see the king is notlikely to gain a subject more by your intrigues;a pretty job you ha^e set me about; and so,14when I have put the poor lady to rest with yourdamned sedative, my tongue must be stopt nextto prevent its blabbing; but I’ll shew you I wasnot born in Andalusia for nothing. Nicolas nowopened a secret drawer, and took out a few piecesof money, which, in fact, was his whole stock ofcash in the world; he loaded and primed his pis¬tols, and carefully lodged them in the holsters ofhis saddle 3 he buckled to his side his trusty spade,and hastened to caparison his mule. Ah, thouimp of the old one, quoth he, as he entered thestable, art not ashamed to look me in the face ?But come, hussy, thou owest me a good turn,methinks; stand by me this once, and be friendsfor ever! thou art in good case, and if thou wiltput thy best foot foremost, like a foithful beast,thou shalt not want for barley on the way. Thebargain was soon struck between Nicolas andhis mute,lie mounted her in the happy moment,and pointing his course toward the bridge ofToledo, which proudly strides with half a dozenlofty arches over a stream scarce three feet wide,he found himself as completely in a desart in halfa mile’s riding, as if he had been dropt in thecentre of Arabia Petrsea. As Nicolas’s journeywas not a tour of curiosity, he did not amusehimself with a peep at Toledo, or Talavera, oreven Merida by the way ; for the same reason hetook a circumbendibus round the frontier townof Badajoz ; and crossing a little brook, refreshedhis mule with the last draught of Spanish water,and instantly congratulated himselt upon enter¬ing the territory of Portugal. Bravo! quothhe, patting the neck of his mule, thou shalthave a supper this night of the* best sive-meatI that Estramadura can furnish ; we are now in acountry where the scattered flock of Israel foldthick and fare well. He now began to chauntthe Sbng of Solomon, and gently ambled on in [the joy of his heart.When Nicolas at length reached the city ofLisbon, he hugged himself in his good fortune;still he Recollected that the Inquisition had longarms, and he was yet in a place of no perfect se¬curity. Our adventurer had in early life actedj as assistant-surgeon in a Spanish frigate boundI to Buenos-Ayres, and been captured by a BritishH man-of-war, and carried into Jamaica, had veryj quietly passed some years in that place as jour-| neyman apothecary, in which time he had ac-J quirtd a tolerable acquaintance with the Englishlanguish. No sooner then did he discover theBritish ensign flying on the poop of an Englishfrigate the lying in the Tagus, than he eagerlycaught the opportunity of paying a visit to thesurgeon; and finding he was in want of a mate,oft’ered himself, and was entered in that capacityfor a cruize against the French and Spaniards,with whom Great Britain was then at war. Inthis secure asylum N;colas enjoyed the first hap¬py moments he had experienced for a long timepast, and being a lively good natured little fel¬low, and one that touched the guitar and sungsequidillas with a tolerable grace, he soon recom¬mended himself to his ship-mates, and grew infavour with every body on board, ftom the cap¬tain to the cook’s mate.When they were out upon their cruize, hover-16ing on the Spanish coast, it occurred'to Nicolas,that the Inquisitor-general at Madrid had toldhim of the expected arrival of the president of 'Quito, and having imparted this to one of thelieutenants, he reported it to the captain ; and asthe intelligence seemed of importance, he availedhimself of it, by bawling into the track of the |homeward-bound galleons, and great was thejoy, iwhen at the break of the morning the man at themast-head announced a square-rigged vessel in jview. The ardour of a chace now set all. hands 1at work; and a few hours brought them nearen- jough to discern that she was a Spanish frigate,and seemingly from a long voyage: little Pedrosa,as alert as the rest, stript himself for his work,and repaired to his post in the cockpit, whilst thethunder of the guns reeled incessantly over hishead; three cheers from the whole crew at lengthannounced the moment of victory, and a fewmore minutes ascertained the good news, that theprize was a frigate richly laden from the SouthSeas, with the governor of Quito and his suiteon board.Pedrosa was now called upon deck, and senton board the prize as interpreter to the first lieu¬tenant, who was to take posession, of her.— Hefound every thing in confusion, a deck coveredwith the slain, and the whole crew in consterna- 1tion at an event they were in no degree prepared ,for, not having received any intimation of a war. IHe found the officers in general, and the passen¬gers without exception, under the most horrid im¬pression of the English, expecting to be butcher¬ed without mercy. Don Manuel de Casafonda,17the governor, whose countenance bespoke a con¬st! tuation far gone in a decline, had thrown him¬self on a sofa, in the last state of despair, andgiven way to an effusion of tears : when the lieu¬tenant entered the cabin he rose trembling fromhis couch, and with the most supplicating action,f presented to him his sword, and with it a casket| which he carried in his other hand : as he tender¬ed these spoils to his conqueror, whether throughhis weakness, or of his own will, he made a mo¬tion of bending his knee: the generous Briton,shocked a£ the unmanly overture, caught himsuddenly with both hands, and turning to Ped¬rosa, said aloud,—Convince this gentleman heis fallen into the hands of an honourable enemy.Is it possible ! cried Don Manuel, and lifting uphis streaming eyes to the countenance of the Brit¬ish officer, saw humanity, valour, and generouspity, so strongly characterized in his youthfulfeatures, that the conviction was irresistable. Willhe not accept my sword? cried the Spaniard.He desires you to wear it, till he has the honourof presenting you to his captain. Ah! then hehas a captain, exclaimed Don Manuel, his sup-perior will be of another way of thinking; tell himthis casket contains my jewels; they are valuable ;let him present them as a lawful prize, which willenrich the captor; his superior will not hesitateto take them from me—If they are your excell¬ency’s private property, replied Predrosa, I amordered to assure you, that if your ship were lad¬en with jewels, no British officer in the serviceof his king will take them at your hands'; the shipand effects of his Catholic Majesty are the only.18prize of the captors; the personals of the passen-igers are inviolate—Generous natioa! exclaimedJ)on Manuel, how greatly have I wronged thee !The boats of the British frigate now came along- ;side, and part of the crew were shifted out of the 1prize, an officer in the stern-sheets, and the crew 1in their white shirts and velvet caps, also came toescort the governor and the ship’s captain onboard the frigate, which lay with her sails to themast, awaiting their arrival: who were receivedon the gang-way by the second lieutenant, whilst iperfect silence and the strictest discipline reigned !in the ship, where all were under the decks, andno inquisitive eyes were suffered to wound the ;feelings of the conquered. In the door of hiscabin stood the captain, who received them with ]complaisance, which does not revolt the unfort¬unate by an overstrained politeness : which could ;not fail to impress the prisoners with the mostfavourable ideas; and as Don Manuel spokeFrench, he could converse with the British Cap¬tain without the help of an interpreter; as he ex¬pressed an impatient desire of being admitted tohis parole, that he might revisit his connections,from w hom he had been long separated, he wasoverjoyed to hear that the English ship wouldcarry her prize into Lisbon ; and that he wouldthere be set on shore, and permitted to make the ,best of his way from thence to Madrid. He 1talked of his wife with all the ardour of the most jimp issioned lover, and on whom he doated with ;tiie fondest affection. The captain indulged himin these convCrsatians, and being a husband him- !self, knew how to allow for all the tenderness ofIiis sensations. Ah, Sir, cried Don Manuel, turn¬ing to Pedrosa, who at that moment entered theruubin, this gentleman, whom I take to be aSpaniard, may have heard the name of DonnaLeonoro de Casafonda ; if he has been at Madrid,it is possible he may have seen her; should that4 be the case, he can testify to her external charms;1 alone can witness the perfections of her mind f Senior Don Manuel, replied Pedrosa, I haveseen Donna Leonora, and your Excellency iswarranted in all you can say in her praise, thesewords threw the uxorious Spaniard into raptures ;his eyes sparkled with delight; the blood rushedi into his emaciated cheeks, and every featureglowed with unutterable joy: he pressed Pedrosawith a variety of rapid enquiries, all which heevaded saying that he had only a casual glanceot her. The embarrassment, however, which ac¬companied these answers, did not escape theEnglish captain, who, shortly after, drawingPedrosa aside into the surgeon’s cabin, was byhim made acquainted with the melancholy situ¬ation of that unfortunate lady, nay, the very vialwas produced, with its contents, as put into thehands of Pedrosa by the Inquisitor.My heart bleeds said the British Captain, forthis unhappy husband; assuredly that monsterhas destroyed Leonora; as for thee, Pedrosa,whilst the British Hag flies over your head,.neith-er Spain, nor Portugal, nor Inquisitors, nor de¬vils, shall annoy thee under its protection ; butif thou ever venturest over the side of this ship,and rashly settest thy foot upon Catholic soil,when we arrive at Lisbon, thou art a lost man.-^-I were worse than a madman, replied Nicolas,should I attempt it Keep close in this asylum:had it been our fate to have been captured byjthe Spaniard, what would have become of thee.Nicolas replied I should have applied to the Inquisitor’s vial; but a ship so commanded and somanned is in little danger of being carried into aSpanish port 1 hope not, said the captain, and 'I promise thee, thou shalt take thy chance in her \as long as she is under my command; and if weconduct her to England, thou shalt have thy pro-per share of prize-money, which, if the galleonbreaks up according to her entries, will be some¬thing towards enabling thee to shift, and if thou :art as diligent in thy calling, as I am persuadedthou wilt be, whilst I live thou shalt never want !a seaman’s friend—At these cheering words,little Nicolas threw himself at the feet of his gen- lerous preserver, and with streaming eyes, pouredout his thanks from a heart animated with joy ]and gratitude The captain raising him by the ;hand, forbade him as he prized his friendship, iever to address him in that posture any more ; Ithank me, if you will, added he, but thank meas one man should another: let no knee bend in !this ship but in adoration of God.—But now,,continued he, let us turn our thoughts to the sit- Juation of our unhappy Casafonda: we are now jdrawing near Lisbon, where he will look to be ‘liberated on his parole. By no means let him ..venture into Spain, said Pedrosa; I am well as¬sured there are orders to arrest him in every port, >or frontier town where he may present hiinselt.I can well believe it, replied the captain; his21 *I piteous case wilt require further deliberation ; inthe mean time, let nothing transpire on your! part; and keep yourself out of his sight as care-si fully as you can—This said, the captain left thecabin, and both parties repaired to their severaloccupations.As soon as the frigate and her prize cast an-I chor in the Tagus, Don Manuel de Casafondaimpatiently reminded our captain of his promisedparole. The painful moment was now come,when an explanation of some sort became una-I voidable: the generous Englishman, with a coun¬tenance expressive of the tenderest pity, took theSpaniard’s hand in his, and seating him on acouch beside him, ordered the centinel to keepthe cabin private, and delivered himself as fol¬lows r—Senior Don Manuel, I must now impart to youthat you have enemies in your own country, whowill arrest you on your landing; but reposesuch trust in my houour, and do not demand afurther explanation—Heaven and earth ! criedthe astonished Spaniard, who can be those ene¬mies, and what have I done to deserve them ! Sofar I will open myself answered the captain, asto point out the Inquisitor-general. The bestfriend I have in Spain, exclaimed the Governor,my sworn protector he my enemy ! impossible.Well sir, replied the captain, I must exert myauthority for your sake, to make this ship yourprison, till I have waited on our minister at Lis¬bon, and enquire for your safety ; but suspend theharshness of tins measure till I return ; and atthe same time, he gave orders for the barge; and#22strict injunctions not to allow of the governer’s \quitting the frigate; he put off for the shore. * iiThe emissaries of the Inquisition had traced tPedrosa, our captain had no sooner gone ashore ; rthan he was accosted by a messenger of state, forthe surrender of Pedrosa; our worthy captain thensaid, that Spaniard is now born on my books, andbefore.you shall take him out of the service of myking you must sink his ship. He instantly pro¬ceeded to the house of the British Minister: herehe found Pedrosa’s intelligence, expressly ver¬ified.The captain lost no time in returning to hisfrigate, where he imparted to Don Manuel theintelligence he obtained at the British Minister’s.The proposal was now suggested of sending let¬ters into Spain, and the governor retired to hisdesk and wrote them. In the afternoon the Min¬ister paid a visit to the captain, and received apacket from Don Manuel, and promised to for- |ward them by a safe conveyance.In due course this fatal letter from Leonora :opened all the horrible transactions to the wretch- ietl husband:—“ The guilty hand of an expiring wife, under 'the agonizing operation of a mortal poison, tracesthese few trembling lines to an injured, wretchedhusband. If thou hast any pity for .my partingspirit, fly the ruin that awaits thee, and avoid ,this scene of villany and horroj:. I have bornea child to the monster, whose poison runs in my 'veins. The Inquisitor is my murderer.— My .pen falls from my hand—Farewell for ever!”Had a shot passed through the heart of Don23Manuel, it could not more effectually have stoptits motions, he dropped lifeless on the couch, butby the care of the captain and Pedrosa. He sou;recovered Grief like his cannot be described byword-*, 'twas suffocating woe.Drop the curtain over this melancholy pause,and attend the mournful widower, now landedupon English ground, and conveyed to thehouse of a noble Earl, the father of our amiablecaptain. At the period of a few tranquillizingweeks, here passed in the bosom of humanity, let¬ters came to hand from the British Minister atLisbon, in answer to a memorial, that I shouldhave stated to have been drawn up by the friend¬ly captain before his departure from that port.By these letters it appeared, that the criminalwas either no longer in existence, or in a situationever to be heard of any more, till roused by theawakening trump, he should be summoned to histremendous last account. As for the unhappywidower, it was fully signified to him, fromauthority, that his return to Spain, whether up¬on exchange or parole, would be no longer op¬posed ; nor had he any thing to apprehend onthe part of government, when he should arrivethere. The same was signified in. fewer wordsto the exculpated Pedrosa,Whether Don Manuel de Casafonda will at afuture period, avail himself of the overtures, timealone can prove: as for little Nicolas, whoseprize money has set him up in a comfortable littleshop in Duke’s place, where he breathes theveins and cleanses the bowels'of his Israelitishbrethren, in a land of fredom and toleration. His24merry heart is at rest, save only when, with firein his eyes, and vengeance on his tongue, heanathematizes the Inquisition : and struts in theSynagogue every Sabbath, with as bold a stepand as erect a look, as if he was himself HighPriest of the Temple, going to perform sacrificesupon the re-assembling of the scattered tribes.

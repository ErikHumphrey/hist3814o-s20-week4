Lumifdenand J, Robert fin in the Fijh-markd, M.DCC.XLIli-t - )Strange and remarkable Predictionsof that holy, learned and excellent' Bifhop, JAMES USHER late‘Primate of Ireland.TH E Author of the Life of this excellent andworthy Primate and Arc’abifhop. gives anAccount, That, among other extraordinaryGifts and Graces which it pleated the Al¬mighty to beftow upon him, he was won¬derfully endued with a Spirit of Prophecy, wherebyhe gave out feveral true Predictions and Prophecies ofThings a greatWhile before they came topafs, where¬of fome we have leen fulfilled, and others remain yetto be accomplilhed : And tho’ he was one that abhorr’efEnthufiaftick Notions, being too learned, rational andknowing, to admit of Pach idle Freaks and Whimfies;yet he profeft, “ That feveral Times in his Life he had“ many Things impreft upon his Mind, concerning fu-“ true Events, with Co much Warmnefs and Importu-“ nity, that he was not able to keep them fecrer, but“ lay under an unavoidable Neceffity to make them“ known. ”From which Spirit he fotetold the Trijb RebellionForty Years before it came to pafs, with the very Timewhen it fhould break forth, in a Sermon preached atDublin in 1601, where, from Ezek. 4. 6. difeourfingconcerning the Prophet’s bearing the Iniquity of Ju¬dah Forty Days, the Lord therein appointed a Day fora Year ; He made this direCf Application in relationto the Connivance at Popery at that Time ; FramJbisTear (fays he) will t reckon the Sin of Ireland, thatthef whom you now embrace fall be your Ruin, and y»uJballbear this Iniquity. Which Prediction proved ex¬actly'(l)adly true; for from that Time 1601, to the Year: 1641, was juft Forty Years, in which it is notoriouflyknown that the Rebellion and Deftru&ion of IreUxdhappened ; which was afted by thofe Popifh Priefts,and other Papifts which were then connived at. Andof this Sermon the Bifhop referved the Notes, and puta Note thereof in the Margent of his Bible; and, forTwenty Years before, he ftill lived in the Expecta¬tion of the fulfilling thereof: And the nearer the Timewas, the more confident he was that it was near. Accom-plifhment, tho’there was no vifible Appearance of anyfuch Thing. And (fays Dr. Bernard) the Year beforethe Rebellion broke forth, the Bifhop taking his Leaveof me, being then going from Ireland to England, headvifed me to a ferious Preparation, for I fhould feeheavy Sorrows and Miferies before I faw him again;which he delivered with as great Confidence as if hehad feen it with his Eyes: Which feems to verify thatof the Prophet, Ama 7. Surtly the Uld ■aill do no¬thing, but he will reveal it to hit Servants the Prcpheis.From this Spirit of Prophecy, he forefaw the Chan¬ges and Miferies ot England in Church and State.For having in one of his Books (called, De prim. Ecct.Brit.) given a large Account of the DeftruCtion of theChurch and State of the Britons by the Saxons, about5 50 Years after Chrift ; he gives this dmong other Rea-fons why he infifted fo largely upon it, Thar he fore-faw that a like Judgment was yet behind, if timelyRepentance and Reformation did not prevent it. Andhe would often mourn upon the Forefight of this, longbeforeit came.From this Spirit he gave mournful Intimations of theDeath of our late Sovereign I. of whom hewould be often fpeaking with Fear and Trembling, c-ven when the King had the greateft Succefs; and wouldtherefore conttanrly pray, knd give all Advices poffible,i to prevent any fuch Thing.Prom this Spirit he forefaW his own Poverty inworldly rhings; and this he would often fpeak ofwith Admiration to the Hearers, when he was in hi*A 2erearoft( 4 )greateft Profperity : Which the Event did moft cer¬tainly verify.From this Spirit he predi&ed the Divifions and Con-fufions in England in Matters of Religion, and the fadConfequences thereof; fome of which we have feenfulfilled : And I pray God, the reft which he fearedmay not alfo be accomplifhed upon us.Laftly, From this Spirit he foretold, That the great-eft Stroke upon the Reformed Churches was yet tocome, and that the Time of the utter Ruin of the Seeof Rome ftiould be when Ihe thought herfelf moftJfecurc. And as to this laft, I fball add a brief Ac¬count from the Perfon’s own Hand who was concernediherein ; which followeth in thefe Words.The Year before this learned and holy PrimateArchbifhop Ufier died, I went to him, and earneftlydeftred him to give me in Writing his Apprehenfionsconcerning Juftification and Sanftfication by Chrift;becaufe I had formerly heard him preach upon thefePoints, wherein he feemed to make thofe great Myfte-ries more intelligible to my mean Capacity, than anyThing which I had ever heard from any other. But,becaufe I had but an imperfedt and confufed Remem¬brance of the Particulars, I took the Boldnefs to im¬portune him, That he would pleafe to give a brief Ac¬count of them in Writing, whereby I might the betterimprint them in my Memory : Of which he would wil¬lingly have excufed himfelf, by declaring his Intenti¬ons of not writing any more ; Adding, That, if he didwrite any Thing, it Ihould not exceed above a Sheet ortwo. But, upon my continued Importunity, I at laftobtained his Promife. . r ,He coming to Town fome Time after, was pleatedto give me a Vifit at my Houfe, where I failed not tcchallenge the Benefit of the Promife he had made meHe replied, [ That he had not writ; and yet he couldnot charge himfelf with any Breach of Promife : roi(laidhe) I did begin to write ; but when I came tcwrite of San&ificarion, that is, of the New Creaturewhich God formeth by his Spirit in every Soul whiflhe doth truly regenerate, I found fo little of it wroughtin myfelf, that I could fpeak of it only as Parrots byRote, and without the Knowledge and Underftandingof what I might have expreft ; and therefore I durftnot prefume to proceed any further upon it.]]And when I feemed to (land amaz’d to near fuch anhumble Confeffion from fo great and experienced aChriftian, he added, [I muft tell you, We do not wellunderftand what Sandtification and the New Creatureare : It is no lefs than for a Man to be brought to anintire Refignation of his Will to the Will of God, andto live in the Offering up of his Soul continually in theFlames of Love, as a whole Burnt-offering to Chrift;and how little {fays be) are many of thofc who pro-fels Chriftianity experimentally acquainted with thisWrork on their Souls ? ]By this Difcourfe, I conceived he had very excel¬lently and clearly difeovered to me that Part of San&i-fication which he was unwilling to write.I then prefumed to enquire of him what his prefentApprehenfions were concerning a very great Perfecu-tion which ffiould fall upon the Church of God inthefe Nations of England, Scotland and Ireland, ofwhich this Reverend Primate had fpoken with greatConfidence, many Years before, when we were in thehigheft and fulleft State of outward Peace and Settle¬ment. I asked him, Whether he did believe thofefadTimes to be part, or that they were yet to come ? Towhich he anfwered, I bat they were yet to come; andthat he did as confidently expeEi it as ever be bad done -•Adding, ‘That this fad Perfecution would fall upon allthe Protefiant Churches of Europe. I replied, That Idid hope it might have been pad as to thefe’Nationsof ours, fince I thought, that tho’ we, who were thePeople thereof, haye been puniflied much lefs than ourSms have deferved; and that our late Wars had madefar lefs Devaluations, than War commonly brint^s uponthefe Countries where it pleafeth God in Judgment toiiifter it; yet we muft needs acknowledge, that manygreat Houfcs had been burnt, ruined, and left without( « )Jr.hafeitants, many great Families impovenfhed andundone) and many rhonland Lives alfo had been loft inthat bloody War ; and that Ireland and Scotland, as■well as England, had drunk very deep of the Cup ofGod’s Anger, even to the Overthrow of the Govern¬ment, and the utter Defolation almoft of a very greatPart of rhofe Countries.But this holy Man turning to me, and fixing his Eyesupon me with that ferious and ireful Look which heulually had when he fpake God’s Word and not hisown, and when the Power of God feemed to be uponhim, and to conftrain him to fpeak, which I couldeafily difccrn much to differ from the Countenancewherewith he ufually fpake to me; he faid thus:[ Fool not yourlelf with fuch Hopes; for I tell you,All you have yet feen, hath been but the Beginning ofSorrows, in refpsft of what is yet to come upon the Pro-iefiant Churches of Chrift, who will ere longffall under aftarper Perlecution than ever yet has been upon them ;and therefore (faid he to me) look you be not foundin the outward Court, but a Worfhipper in the Templebefore the Altar: For Chrift will meafure all thofe thatprofefs his Name, and call themlelves his People ; andthe outward Worlhippers he will leave out, to be tro-den down by the Gentiles. The outward Court {fayshe) is the formal Chriftian, whofe Religion lies in per¬forming the outfide Duties of Chriftianity, withouthaving an inward Life and Power of Faith and Loveuniting them to Chrift ; and theft God will leave tobe troden down and fwept away by the Gentiles. Butthe Worfliippers within theTemple, and before the Al¬tar, are theft who indeed worftiip God in Spirit and inTruth, whoft Souls are made his Temple ; and he ishonoured and adored in the moft inward Thoughts oftheir Hearts, and they facrifice their Lufts and vileAft’efttons, yea, and their own Wills to him : Andtheft God will hide in the Hollow of his Hand, andunder the Shadow of his Wings. And this lhall be onegreat Dift'erence between rhislaft and all other precee-ding Pcrfecutions : For, in the former the moft cmi-° nentClifiDuns did K«„Kyiutter moft, and were moft violenrlv u *in this laft Pcrfccution, thcfe ftaH hr uPon .hur,God as a Seed to partake of hat G ” wlSSr^mediately folio, ami eon* ulo Scju' e r'”'as ever this Storm fliall be over- Prr ^-5",,^ fooi>iharpeft, fo it /hall be the Zrtk 1^“all; and fhall only rakeaway £ Prl (o -f the™formal ProfelTors, but the true fpS^lbe preferved till the Calamity be overpaft ] 5I then asked him.

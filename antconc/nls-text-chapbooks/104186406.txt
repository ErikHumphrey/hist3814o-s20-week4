nought seem'd to cheer herSae mony things appearing new,Cam' ilka minute in her view,And fill'd her mind sae fu' o' dread,Cracking was clean out o' her head.In course, the Pastor, her example,That brought her there to feed her ample,Stic notic’d twa or three times takeOut o' a' dish slaik after slaikO' MUSTARD; which she judg'd to beGravic, or some delicious brie;For Margret never did peruse it,Kenn'd na' its name, nor how to use it;But now determin'd to partake o't,She wi‘ a tea-spoon took a slaik o't,Heedless she supped up the whole,Then instantly she looked droll,Dung doited in a moment's space,She hung her head and threw her face !Threw down her knife an' fork displeas'd.Syne wi' baith hands her nose she seiz'd,While it did bite an' blin’ her een ;The like o't sure was never seen;For startin’ up as fast as able;The haill gear tumbl'd aff the table !The crash o' crock'ry ware resounded,6Plates truntlin‘—ilka ane confounded.Straight to the door she frantie flew,An‘ after her Mess John she drew;Which drave the company a’ throuther,As they were kippled baith thegither.But in a crack, the prins brak loose,An’ Margret, ravin’ left the house,Hameward, in haste, she hobbl’d sweating,Tell,d Tamos the disaster greetingWrung baith her han‘s, an* solemn sware,To dine wi* gentle folk nae mair.SODA WATER.Puir Scotland‘s scaith is whisky rife,The very king o* curses ;Breeds ilka ill, care, trouble, strife,Ruins health and empties purses.It fills a peaceful land wi* strife,The ale house fills wi* roarin*;It fills wi* broils domestic life,An* fills the kirk wi* snoarin*.i’Twas on a bonny morn in May,Twa three chiels did forgather,The night before they’d gane astray,And were a’ drunk thegither ;Wi’ pain their pows were like to part,Their very tongues did russel ;Wi’ shilpit look and shiverin heart,And throats as dry’s a whussel.7$CO for a drink of something cool,Says ane, for I’m maist faintin ;Then let’s go in, another says,For my puir head’s just rentin.And I’ve the very best receipt,The stomach fumes to scatter ;Then lose nae time and let us getA waught o’ Soda Water.Water will never do, says ane,Gie me some cheese that’s mittie,And then a bumper o’ good gin,Or sterling aquavitae :To make you right this is the plan,’Twill make you fair and fatter;But says the chiel that first began,There’s nought like Soda Water.If Soda Water be sae good,Gang ye and drink your fill;But I wad hae it understood,That I’d prefer a gill;Water’s a blessing, nae doubt, fixt,And may it ne’er be missing;But when wi’ whisky it is mixt,It‘s then a double blessing.On fixed air the hale house rang,And pointed observations,For some were right and some were wrung,.And some were out o‘ patience.Ye dinna seem to be in haste,For a£ your chitter chatter;Come bring it in, and let us tasteThis self same Soda Water,Unto ilk man a bottle‘s plac‘d,In silent expectation,That they wad better be in hasteAfter so much oration;It‘s just to be, or not to be,To take an unkenn{d doze,Short-sighted man can hardly seeAn inch before his nose«I'll ask a favour frae ilk man,And ye will surely grant it.To drink it up as quick's you can,Nor take time to decant it;Like bugle-horns then in a raw,They glower up to the lift,And it was hardly down when twaO' them began to rift.That's curious stuff, it's made me weel,I ne'er drank this before,Wi' that the Soda Watei chielGot up wi' sic a roar;I'm gone, I'm poison'd, fatal drink !For me there is no cure,When o'er his cheeks, black streamsRan gushing to the floor. [like ink,He held the bottle up to break,Nae langer life expeckin,Syne read the label round it's neck,The real Japan Blackin ;He's ill before, but now he's worse,Wi' gut and ga' he's partin,And ‘twixt ilk boak he gaed a curseAgainst real Day and Martin.

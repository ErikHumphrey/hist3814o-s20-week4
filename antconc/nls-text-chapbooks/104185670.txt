river clear ;And many a little filh,doth in that river play.And many a lad and many a lafs/went abroad a making hay>In came a jolly fcythe man,to mow the meadow down,With budget and with bottleof ale that’s flout and brown:All labouring men of courage bold,came there their fkill to try,Let’s whet and blow, and ftoutly mow,for the grafs cuts very dry.There’s nimble Tib and Tom,with pitchfork and with rake,There’s Molly, Nell and Sufan,came here their hay to make »Af 8 ]Sweet jag, jug, jug, jug, fweet jug,the Nightingale doth fing.From morning until evening,as they were a hay-making.But when that bright Phoebus,the fun, was going down,A merry difpofed piper,approaching from the town,Pull'd out his pipe and tabor,difpoling for to play,Which made them all lay do wn their rakes,and leave off making hay.So joining with the dance,we jig it on the green;Though tir’d with our labour,no wearinels was feen ;All tripping like to fairies,our dance we did purfue,With leading up, and calling off,till the morning it’s in view.Then each lad he takes his lafs,the morning being come,And lays her down on the hay-cock,till the riling of the fun ;There {porting all the time,while the harmlefs birds do ling,Fach lad doth rife, and take his lafs,and away to hay-making,FINIS,

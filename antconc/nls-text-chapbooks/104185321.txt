ROBERTSONM D C C X 6.THECOMICAL TRANSACTIONSO FLOTHIAN TOM.PART I.THIS Thomas Black, vulgarly called Lothian Tom,becaufe of that country, was born four miles fromEdinburgh, his father, being a very wealthy farmer,rave him good education, which he was very aukwardn receiving, being a very wild, crofs, mifchievous boy.When he was about ten years of age, he was almolt;illed by the itroke of a horfe’s foot, which his fatherad, who had a trick of kicking at every perfon thatame in behind him. But when Tom was got heal ofhe dreadful wound, whereof many thought he wouldave died to be even with the horfe, he gets a clog, orpiece of tree which was full of wooden pins; fuch ahing as the Ihoemakers ufe to foften their leather up-n; and with a rope he tied it to the couple bauk in theable, dire&ly cppofite to the horfe’s tail, gets up onte bauk, and gives it a fwing back, fo that the pikes illte end of it, came with a full drive againft the horfe’srfe, which made him to fling, and the more he flungid (truck at it, it rebounded back again and ftruck him ;re battle lafted with great fury for a Lng time, whichas good diverflon for Tom, until his father, hearingme diflurbance in the liable, came in to know the mat-r, and was furprifed when he faw the poor horfe tari¬ng his own hide, with his legs all cut and bloody,: cut the rope and the battle was ended, but the poorirfe would never kick at any that came behind him af-rwards, but always ran from it.ItCOMICAL TRANSACTIONS, &c. 3It happened one day that Tom went a fifhing, andbrought home a few fmall fifh, which his grandmother’scat fnapt up in the dark : fo Tom, to have juitice of thecat for fo doing, catches her, and puts her into a littletub, or cog, then fets her a-drift into a mill-dam, order¬ing her to go a-fiihing for herfelf; then fets out two orthree dogs upon her, where a moll terrible fea-fight en-fued, as ever was feen on frelh water; for if any of thedogs allayed to board her, by fetting in-over their nofe,badrans came flying to that quarter, to repulfc him withher claws: then the veffel was like to be overfet by theweight of herfelf, fo flic had to flee to the other, andfinding the fame there, from thence to the middle, whereflic far mewing, always turning herfelf about, combingtheir nofes with her foot. The old woman being in¬formed of the dangerous fituation of her dearly belovedcat, came running with a long pole to beat oft' the dogs,and haul her alhore : What now, fays Tom, If you begoing to take part with my enemies, you fliall have partof their reward ; then gives the old w'omau fuch a puftithat (he tumbled into the dam over head and ears, befide her beloved cat, and would undoubtedly have periihed in the water, had not one of the people who wa;there, looking at the diverfion, come to her relief.After this Tom was fent to the fchool to keep hihand out of an ill turn : and, having an old canker’dcrab-witted fellow for his dominie, they were always avariance, for if Tom had got his whips, which he ofteideferved, he was fure to be revenged upon his mailer again for it. So Tom perceiving his mailer had a clofellool in a little clofet within the fchpol, where he wenand eafcd himfelf when need was: Tom gets a pennyworth of gun-powder, and ftrinkled it on the groundirectly before the feat, and lays a little of it along intrain to the fire-fide, then perceiving when his ma.{t<went into it, and as he was loofing dpwn his breecnefets fire to the train, which blew it all np about his ma!let’s bare hips, and fcorched him terribly, befid*the fright, for which Tom was leverely whipt; yet :a little after he began to It tidy revenge on his mailer.So it happened one day as Tom went into the maA 2 tei4 COlvTTCAL I' R A N S A C T I 0 N S ter’s houfe, the wife was (looping into a big meal bar¬rel, to bring out fome meal; there he takes her by thefeet, and coups her up into the barrel with her headdown, and her bare back-iide uppermoft ; then runs in¬to the fchool, crying, O mailer! mafter! the de’ii’slooking out o’ your meal (land, wi’ a fat face, and a |black ill faur’d mouth: yon’s juft Auld Nick if he be li- Iving. At this the mafter ran with all the fpeed he couldto fee what it was, and found it to be his own wife,fpeechlefs and almoft fmothered to death, but as (he couldnot tell who did it, Tom got clear off: yet he was notfatisfied without fome more vengeance on the old fel¬low : and knowing his mafter had a fafhion, when he iwas going to whip the boys, if they would not loofetheir breeches willingly, he drew his knife and cut themthrough the waiftband behind: So Torn goes to a but¬cher and gets a raw pudding, and fills it with blood andwater, and puts-it within the waiftband of his breeches,then goes to fchoo! next day, and as the mafter was fit¬ting with his back towards the fire, Tom lights a pieceof paper, and fets his wig in a low, which burnt forTome time unperceived, until the flames came fizzing a-3out his ears: he firft put out the flames by trampling on:he wig, and being informed that Tom did it, flies torim in a rage, ordering him to loofe his breeches, butTom told him he was never fo mad : then he drew hiscnife, and whips poor Tom over his knee, and withrreat kicking and (Iruggling, cuts the waiftband of hisrreeches through pudding and all, fo that the blood gufh-d out, and Tom cried out murder! murder! and downic fell. The poor dominie went out of the door cryingnd wringing his hands. Word flew about that Tom/as (ticket by the dominie, which made the people cometinning from feveral parts of the country round about,o fee how it was : but fearching him, they found onlyhe empty pudding, which difeovered the fraud: Thenwo men had to get horfes and ride after the poor domi-ie, who had by this time got two or three miles away,nd when he faw them coming after him, crying to itand,nd come hack again, he ran the falter, until he couldju no more, but fell over on the road, praying them tolet■■ I     -   Tlet him go, for, if he was taken back, he was fare to behanged; and would not be perfuaded Tom was alive,until they forced him back and he faw him, but he wouldbe Tom’s teacher no longer; fo Tom’s father had tofeek another mafter for him.PART II.THERE was a young woman fervant to Tom’s fa¬ther, whom Tom had offended by fome of his tricks, |and (he, to be up with Tom again, one night fpread ahandful of fhort nettles in his bed, between the fheets,which flung his kgs and thighs fo much, that he wasobliged to quit his bed for foine part of the night; forwhich he refolved to be revenged, whenever a properopportunity offered. It happened in a few days after,that (he was invited to a wedding, where the dancing and ,diverfion induced her to flay all night; and on coming ,home in the morning, her miflrefs fet her to walk fomeclothes. But fhe, being fatigued with her night’s diver- ,lion, and for want of reft, fell faft afleep with her handsextended in the tub, and ftanding on her feet with herbelly leaning on the tub ; Tom perceiving this, flipsher petticoats and fmqck over her head, letting the funfhine on her bare backfide, which faced the highway.Several people palling by, while fhe continued in this,pofture, fomej of them were diverted, and others a-,fhamed at the fight. But a poor cadger had the mif-fortune to be coming on the road at the time, and hishorfe, taking fright at this unufual light, threw off thecreels, and broke the poor man’s eggs all to frnalh,,which fo enraged him, that he lafhed her buttocks withhis whip, in fuch an unmerciful manner, that with thefmart and fhame together, fhe had not the leaft incline.-'tion to fleep for the remaining part of that dayTom, being grown up to the years and age of a man,,thought himfelf wifer and flyer than his father ; and’there were feveral things about the houfe he liked beti .-r’than to work, fo He turned to be a dealer amongil - ;brutes, a cowper of horfes and cows, &c and e -n \ware amongfl the brewers and brandy {hops, until hecowped himfelf to the toom halter; and then his parentswould fupply him no more. He knew well his grand¬mother had plenty of money, but die would give himnone, but the old woman had a good black cow of herown, which Tom went to the fields one evening, andcatches, and takes her into an old watte houte whichflood at a dittance from any other, and there he kepther two or three days, giving her meat and drink whenit was dark at night, and made the old woman believefomebody hail dole the cow for their winter’s mart,which was grief enough to the old woman, for the lofsof her dearly beloved cow. However, die employsTom to go to a fair that was near by, and buy her a-nother, gives him three pounds, which Tom accepts ofvery thankfully, and promifes to buy one as like the o-ther as poffibly he could get; then he gets a piece of.chalk, and brays, it as fmall as meal, and deeps it in alittle water, and therewith rubs over the cow’s face andiback, which made her baith brucket and rigget: So Tomlin the morning takes the cow to a public houfc within:a little of the fair, and left her till the fair was over,land then drives her home before him ; and as foon asthey came home, the cow began to rout as die ufed to:do, which made the old woman to rejoice, thinking itwas her own black cow, but, when die faw her whiteiface, fighed and faid, Alas! thou’ll ne’er be like theikindly brute, my Black-lady, and yet routs as like herias ony ever 1 did hear: but fays Tom to himfclf, it’s aimercy you know not what die fays, or all would bewrong yet. So in two or three days the old woman putforth her bra rigget cow in the morning with the red ofher neighbours’ cattle, but it came on a fore day of hea¬vy rain, which wadied away all the white from her faceand back; fo the old woman’s Black-lady came home "atnight, and her rigget cow went away with the fhowerand was never heard of. But Tom’s father having fomefufpici''", and looking narrowly into the cow’s face,found fome of the chalk not wadied away, and then hegave poor Tom a hearty beating, and fent him away tofetk his fortune with a dun full of fore bones.PARTPART III.TOM, being now turned to his own fhifts, confiderswith himfelf how to raife a little more money,gets a long ftring as near as he could guefs to be thelength of his mother, and into Edinburgh he goes, toa wright who was acquainted with his father and mo¬ther : the wright alking him how he did; he anfweredhim, very foberly, he had loft a good dutiful motherlaft night, and there’s a meafure for her coffin. Tomwent out and ftaid for fome time, and then comes inagain, and tells the wright he did not know what to do,for his father had ordered him to get money from facta man whom he named, and he was that day gone outof town ; the wright afked him how much he wantedto which he anfwered, a guinea and a half might do, 01thirty ffiillings at the leaft ; fo he gave him the guinerand the half: then Tom gave him ftrift charges to be outon the morrow againft eleven o’clock with the coffinand he ffiould have his money altogether : Tom fct outfor the ale-houfe with the money, and lived well whiltit lafted. Next morning, the wright and his two lad;went out with the coffin : and as they were going intcthe houfe, Tom’s mother Hands at the door, alking'tinmatter how he did, and where he was going with thatfine coffin ? he did not know well what to fay, being ftfurprifed to fee her alive, but at laft he told her, her foibrought in the meafure the day before, and had got tguinea and a half from him, which he fat’d was to birfome other necefiaries for the funeral. O the roguefaid fhe, has he play’d me that: So the wright got higuinea and a half, and fo much for his trouble, and hatto take back his coffin with him again.Tom being now fhort of money again began to thinl,how he could raife a frefh fupply; fo he went to tin'port amongft the (hearers, and there he hired about thirty of them, and agreed to give them a whole week’(hearing at tcnpencc a-day, which was Urn pence high-cr than any had got that year, this made the poor fliear-;rs think he was an honed, generous and genteel maf-er, as ever they got, for he took them all into an ale-icufe, and gave them a hearty breakfaft, till they could'at no more. Now lays he, when there is fo many of youogether, perhaps from different parts, and unacquaint-:d with one another, I do not know but there may be'ome of you honed men, and fome of you rogues ; andis you are'to lie all in one barn together, any of you,vho has any money, you’ll be fured to give it to me,»nd I’ll mark it down in my book with your names, andtvhat I receive from each of you, and you diall have ita 11 again on Saturday’s night, when you get your wa.-ges. O! very well, goodman; take mine, take mine,every one fader than another; fome gave him five, fix,feven and eight (hillings ; even all they had earned thro*the harved, which amounted to near feven pounds der-iing. Having got all their money, he goes on withthem, till about three miles out of town, and com¬ing to a great field of danding corn, though fomething'green, yet convenient foy bis purpofe, as it lay at fomcdidance from any houfe or perfon ; fo he made thembegin there, telling them he was going to order dinnerfor them, and fend his own fervants to join them : A-way he goes with all the fpeed he could, but take$ a-nother road into the town, led they (hould follow andratch him.Now when the people to whom the corn' belonged,Taw fuch a band in their field, they could not underdandthe meaning of it; but the goodman, whofe corn it was,.vent off crying always as he ran, to them to dop ; butihey would not, until he began to drike at them and:hey at him, he being in a great pafiion, as the corn wasnot fully ripe ; at lad by force of argument, and othertaeople coming up to them, the poor (hearers were con¬vinced they had got the bite, which caufed them to goWay lamenting their misfortune' In two or three days thereafter, as Tom was goinglown the Canongate, he meets one of his (hearers,ivho knew him and kept fad by him, demanding hisbroney and fa'jtfadfion for the red : Whi(ht, whidrt,faysfays Tom, and you’ll get yours and fomething elfe be-fide. So Tom takes him into the jail, and calls for abottle of ale and a dram, then takes the jailor afide, asif he had been going to borrow the money from him ;and fays to the jailor, this man here is a great thief, Iand two others have been in fcarch of him thefe threedays, and the other two men have the warrant withthem, fo if you keep the rogue here till 1 run andbring them, you fball have a guinea in reward ; yesfaid the jailor, go and I'll fix the rogue for you. Tom,gets clear out, leaving the poor innocent fellow andthe jailor ftruggling together, and then fets off forEngland dire&ly.P ATOM having now left his own native country, wenrnto the county of Northumberland, where he bir,cd himfelf with an old mifer of a farmer; and here hcontinued for feveral years, performing his duty in hifervice very well, though fometimes playing a roguif]bite on thofe about him : his mailer had a very naughtcuftom, that he would allow them no candle at night tfee with when at fupper; Tom one night fets himfe!next to his mailer, and as they were all about to faon, Tom puts his fpoon into the midll of the dilh whcrthe crowdy was hotteft, and claps a fpoonful into hmailer’s mouth; a pox on you for a rogue, cried hmallerj for my mouth is all burnt; a pox on you for.mailer, fays Tom, for you keep a houfe as dark -Purgatory, for I was going to my own mouth with thfoup, and mifs'd the way it being fo dark ; don't thinmailer, that I am fuch a big fool as to feed you, whiI have a mouth of my own : So from that night thTom burnt his mailer’s mouth with the hot crowdjthey always got a candle to Ihew them light at fuppi,for his mailer would feed no more in the dark while Tcwas prefent.There was a fervant girl in the houfe, who, alwawh;when (he made the beds, neglefted to make Tom’s, butwould have him to do it himfelf, well then fays Tom,I have harder work to do, ar.d I (hall do that too, fonext day when Tom was in the field at the plow, whenhe faw his mafter coming from the houfe towards him,he left the horfes and the plow Handing in the field,and goes away towaids his mafter, who cried, whatis wrong, or is any thing broke with you ? No, no,fays Tom, but 1 am going home to make my bed, ithas not been made thefe two weeks, and juft now it is a-bout the time the maid makes all the reft, fo I’ll gohome and make mine too. No, no, firrah, go backto your plow, and I’ll caufe it be made every night foryou; then fays Tom, I’ll plow two or three furrowsmore in the time.1 There was a butcher came to his mafter’s and boughtk fine fat calf, fa Tom laid it on the horfe’s neck be¬fore the butcher, and when he was gone, now faysTom, what will you hold mafter, but I’ll fteal thatJ:alf from the butcher before he goes two miles off?Why, fays his mafter, I’ll hold a guinea you don’t:lone, fays Tom; in he goes, and gets a good flioe oflis matter’s, ar.d runs another way a-crofs the fields,\ntil he got before the butcher, near to the corner ofhe hedge, where there was an open and turning of theVay, here Tom darns himfelf behind the hedge, andbrows the {hoe in the middle of the high-way, then upomes the butcher riding and his calf before him ; heyrid he to himfelf,* there’s a good {hoc, if I knew howb get on my calf again I would light for it, but whatgnifies one without its neighbour, fo off he goes and'ts it ly ; Tom then flips out and takes up the (hoe a-ain, and runs crofs the fields, until he got in he¬re the butcher, at another open of the hedge, aboutjdf a mile diftant, and there he throws out the flioe a-fin on the midft of the way; then up comes the but-jier, and feeing it, fays to himfelf, now I fliall have^air of good (hoes for the lifting, and down he comes,ye the calf on the ground, and tying his horfe to the■dge, runs back, thinking to get the other fhoe, in,ifich time, Tom whips up the calf and (hoe, and homehehe comes, demanding his wages, which his mailer couldnot deny, being fo fairly won.The poor butcher returned back to bis horfe, got on¬ly his travel for his pains, fo miffing his calf, he knewnot what to fay or do, but thinking it had broke therope from about its feet, and had run into the fields, thebutcher fpent that day in fearch of it amongft. the hed¬ges and ditches, and fo returned to Tom’s mailer’s allnight, intending to go and fearch farther for it next day,giving them a tedious relation how he came to lofe itby a curfed pair of Ihoes, which he believed the devilhad dropt in his way, and how he had taken the calfand all along with him, expreffing his thankfulnefs thatthe devil was fo honeft as to fpare his old horfe when heHole away his calf. Next morning Tom vrent to workand makes a fine white face on the calf with chalk andwater, then brings it out and fells it to the butcher,which was good diverfion to his mailer and other fer-vants, to fee the butcher buy his own calf again ; ncfooner was he gone with it, but Tom fays, now mailerwhat will you hold but I’ll Ileal it from him again, er<he goes two miles off? No, no, fays his mailer, I’ll holeno more betts with you, but i’ll give you a {hilling iyou do it, done fays Tom, it will coll you no moreand away he runs a-foot thro’ the fields, until he cam<before the butcher, hard by the place where he Hole tkcalf from him the day before: and here he lies behimthe hedge, and as the butcher came paft, he puts his hanon his mouth, and cries haw, haw, like a calf; thbutcher hearing this, fwears to himfelf, that there wathe calf he had loft the day before, down he comes ar.'throws the calf on the ground, gets in thro’ the h?dgin all hade, thinking he had no more to do but to takit up ? but as he came in at one part of the hedge, Toijumps out at another, and gets the calf on his back,then gets in over the hedge on the other fide, and thr<the fields he came fafely home, with the calf on his badwhile the poor butcher fpent his time and labour in vai;running from hedge to hedge, and hole to hole, feekinwhat rvas not there to be found. So the butcher returred to his horfe again, and finding his other calf gon1he concluded it to be done by fome invifible fpirit aboutthat fpot of ground ; and fo went home and raifed abad report on the devil, faying, he was turned a high¬wayman, and had taken two calves from him. So Tomwafhing the white face of the ftolen calf, his mafter fentthe butcher word to come and buy another calf whichhe accordingly did a few days after, and Tom fold himthe fame calf th^third time ; then told him the wholeaffair as it was afted, giving him his money again, fothe butcher got but fun for his trouble.PART V.*THERE was an old rich blind woman, who livedhard by, that had a young girl, her only daughter,jmd (he fell deep in love with Tom, and Tom fell asleep in love with the money, but not with the maid,\he old woman beftowed a vaft of prefents on Tom, and'mounted him like a gentleman, but (till he put off thecarriage, from time to time, and always wanted fome-ihing, which the old woman gave the money to purchafeor him, until he had got about thirty pounds of her’noney, and then (he would delay the marriage no long¬er ; Tom went and took the old woman and girl afide,nd made his apology as follows: Dear mother, faii.e, I am very willing to wed with my dear Polly, fortie appears as an angel in mine eyes, but I am forry,cry forry to acquaint you, that I am not a fit matchor her; what child, fays the old woman, there’s not a'tter match in the world for my Polly. I did not think;our country could afford fuch a clever youth as what Itar of you to be, you (hall neither want gold nor fil¬er, not a good horfe to ride upon, and when I die you^all bnve my all: O but fays Tom, mother that’s notlie matter at all, the flop is this, when I was at homeScotland, I got a ftroke with a horfe’s foot on theottom of my belly, which has quite difabled me below,lat I cannot perform a hufcand’s duty in bed. Thenl.e old woman clapt her hands, and fell a crying, O !OF LOTHIAN TOM. 13if it had been any impediment but that, but that, butthat wofu^that! which gold nor filver cannot purchafe,and yet the pooreft people, that is, even common beggarshave plenty of it. The old woman and her daughterfat crying and wringing their hands, and Tom flood andwept left he ftiould get no more money. O fays Polly,mother I’ll wed with him neverthelefs, I love him fodearly ! No, no, you foolilh girl, would you throwyolirftlf away, to marry a man and die a maid, youdon’t know the end of your creation, it is the enjoy¬ment of a man in bed, that makes women to marry,which is a pleafure like Paradife, and if you wed withthis man, you’ll live and die and never know it. Hoo,hoo, fays Tom, if I had got money, I needed not beenthis way till now: money, you fool, faid the old wo¬man, there’s not fuch a thing to be got for money in allEngland; ay, fays Tom, there’s a dodtur in Newcaftle,will make me as able as any other man for ten guineas ;ten guineas, faid fhe, I’ll give him fifty guineas if hewill, but here is twelve, and go to him diredtly, andknow firft what he can do, and come again and wed mychild, or (he and I will die both for thy fake. Tom,having now got twelve guineas more of their money,got all things ready, and next morning early fet outfor Newcaftle, but inftead of going to Newcaftle, hecame to old Scotland, and left Polly and her mother tothink upon him, then in about two weeks after, whenhe was not like to return, no, nor fo much as a wordfrom him, the old woman and Polly got a horfe, andcame to Newcaftle in feareh of him, went thro’ all thedodtor’s fhops, alking if there came a young man thereabout two weeks ago, with a broken cock to mend :fome laughed at her, others were like to kick her outof doors, fo they had to return without getting anyfarther intelligence of him.Now after Tom’s return to Scotland, he got a wifeand took a little farm near Dalkeith, and became a verydoufe man for many days, following his old bufinefs thcowping of horfes and cows, the feeding of veals fo{laughter and the like : He went one day to a fair anbought a fine cow irOm an old woman, hut Tom judg14 COMICAL TRANSACTIONSed by the lownefs of the price vtjat the cow certainlyhad fome fault: Tom gives the Wife the other heartybicker of ale, then fays he. Wife, the money is yours",and the cow is mine, ye muft tell me ony wee bits offauts it fhe has: Indeed, quo’ the goodwife, (he hasnae a'Taut but ane, and if (he wanted it, I wad ne¬ver a parted vvi’ her: and what’s that goodwife ? faid he,Indeed, faid (he, the filthy daft bead fucks ay herfel:hute, fays Tom, if that be all, I’ll foon cure her ofthat. O ! can ye do’uj faid (he, if I had kend what hada don’t, ye wadna gotten her. A well, fays Tom, I’lltell you what to do, tak the cow’s price I gave you juftnow, and tye it hard and fall in your napkin, and give'it to me through beneath the cow’s wame, and I’ll givelyou the napkin again over the cow’s back, and I’ll layimy life for it that (he’ll never fuck herfel in my aught";I wat well, faid (he, 1’le do that an’ there (hou’d bewitchcraft in’t, fo Tom no fooner got it through belowkhe cow’s wame than he loofes out his money and putsit in his own pocket; and gave the wife again her nap¬kin over the cow’s back, accordingly as he told her,faying, now Wife, you have your cow and 1 my mo¬ney, and (he’ll never fuck herfelf in my aught, as Itold you : O dole, cried the Wife, is that your cure,ye’ve cheated me, ye’ve cheated me.TOM being very fcarce of money at a time when hisrent was to pay, and tho’ he was well acquaint¬ed with the butchers in Edinburgh, he tried feverals ofthem, yet none of them would lend him as much, he>vas known to be fuch a noted (harper, Tom thinks withliiimfelf, that he’ll give them all a bite in general, who'.iad rtfufed him : So in he comes next day (and all of:hem had heard of a fine fat calf he had feeding) comesto one of the butchers and tells him he was going to fell’ he fat calf lie had at home. Well, faid the butcher,aid what will you have for it ? juft five and thirty (hil¬lingsPART VI.lings, fays Tom ? No, fays the butcher, by what I hearof it. I’ll give you thirty. Na, na, fays Tom, youmuft remember, that is not the price of it, but give metwenty fhillings juft now, and fend out your lad to¬morrow and we’ll perhaps agree about it. Thus Tomwent through ten of them in one day, and got twentyfhillings from each of them, and kept his fpeech againftthe law for whatever they offered him for his calf, hetold them to remember that was not to be the priceof it, but give me twenty fhillings juft now, andfend out your lad on the morrow morning, and per¬haps we’ll agree, was all that paffed. So Tom camehome with his ten pounds, and paid his rent; andearly next morning, one of the butchers fent out hislad to Lothian Tom’s for the calf, and as he was abouta mile out of town, he went to an ale-houfe door andthere calls for a bicker of ale, and as he was drinkingit, up comes another butcher’s lad on the fame errand,he being called by the firft to come and drink, whichcaufed another bicker; then up comes other two on thefame errand, again fix more, which made out the ten,and every one told he was going to Lothian Tom’s fora calf, which made them think Tom had gathered to¬gether all the calves in the countryfide : So up theycame to Tom’s houfe, and every one called for his calf,and his calf, and Tom had but one calf to ferve themall; which he took and fhewed them. Now, fays he,whoever gives moil for it fhall have it, or I’ll put it toa roup. What, faid they, our mafterS bought it yefter-day. Then, fays Tom, you would be fools to buy itto day, for it is heavy to carry, and fafhious to lead, youmuft all go home without it: next day Tom got tenfummonfes, to anfwer at the inftance of the butchers forfelling his calf and not delivering it. Tom then goesto Edinburgh, gets the ablelt lawyer in town for thatpurpofe, tells him the whole of what pall, from firft tolaft. Then faid the lawyer, as they cannot prove a bar¬gain, deny you the paying of the money again, and ifI you’ll give me the calf. I’ll bring you off; but remem¬ber, in law there is no point like that of denial. Thei calf, fays Tom, you’ll not w’ant the calf and a ftone otbutterfr,—l. U m 11. ^ i, i iv iwj> J L L 1butter to make it ready with. Then the lawyer goesto the court, where Tom is called upon : the lawyer an-fwers firit, who aflced the butchers, if they could tellthe price of the calf or prove the bargain ? they an-fwered, no, but he ordered us to fend out our lads and 'we would agree about it. Agree about it, fnid the jud¬ges ? why do you come to fue for a bargain and to agreeabout it yet ? Ay, but faid they, vve want twenty (hil¬lings a piece from him of the money we gave him. Tomis called upon, then faid the Judge, did you borrowtwenty (hilligns of any of thefe men ? Not 1, my Lord,I came indeed afking the loan of money from them, butthey would lend me none, and then I came next day beg¬gar ways and they were fo generous as to give me twen-1 ty (hillings the piece.

Bjth parties werearmed; yet an attack feinted as unlikely ontheir part as we knew it to be on our o'*n.—I had, at this time) a dctle boy, of not ir,orethan feven years of age in my hand. The childfeemed to attra& their attention very much;for they frequently pointed to him, and fpoketo each other; and, a* he was not frightened,I advanced with him towards them, at the fametime baring his Uu'om, and Hie wing the white-nefs of the {kin. On the clothes being removed,they gave a loud ezeiamatiem! and one of the-pa’-ty, an old m?n, v. ith a long beard, hideoullyrf 'y, came dole to u«. I bade the boy not beafraid cad introduced him to the acquaintanceof hi* uncouth perfonage. The Indian withgrea gentler.efs, laid his hand on the child’sHat. and afterwards felt his clothes, mutteringto himfelf all the while. I found it neeeffary*however, by this time, to fend away the child,as fuch a dole conneftion rather alarmed him;and in this the conclufion verified I gave nocffencs to the old gentleman. Indeed, it wasputting ouvfelves on a par with them; as Ihad oblerved. from the fjrft. that feme youthsof their own, though conftderably older thanthe one with us, were kept bacn by the grownpeople Several more now came up. to whom Iwe made various prefents ; but our toys feemednot to be regarded as very valuable, r.or wouldtdev, tor a long time, make a»y returns torthem; but, before we parted, a large Club,with a head almoft fufficient to fell an ox. was.obtained in exchange for a Looking Glaf;Theft people feemed at a lois to know (nro-habl( n )bablv frem oar want of beard*) of what fexwe were, which having underftcod, they burftinto tbe moil immoderate fit* of laughter,talking to each other, at the fame time, withfuch rapidity and vociferation, a» I had neverbefore heard.

The firli objedl of our peoplewas to w in their afTet'iion; and the nest to con¬vince them of our fuperiority. To thi* pur-pofe an officer, one day, prevailed on one o£them to place a target, made of bark, againfta tree, which he fired at with a piftol, at thedillance of fome pace*. The Indians, ihonghterrified at the report, did not run atfray, buttheir atlonilhment exceeded their alarm, OBlocking at the firield w hich the ball had per¬forated. As thi* produced a little thynefa,the officer, touiffipate their fears, and removetheir jealcufy. whittled the air of Marlbroak^with which they appeared highly charmed, andimitated him with c jUal pieafure and readinef*.After the Governor had arrived at Sydney-Cove, and had ertiled temporary hut*, where-ever they could get places "clear of trees andbuthes, they began to clear the ground, and' lines are traced out for the ptincipal itreet*o?c « >cf an intended town, to be terminated by theGovernor’* houfe, the Main Guard, and theCrim'.nal-Gourt, In feme rartj of this fpace,tempoiary barracks’were firtt ert&ed, but no jpermanent buildings will be fuffered to beplaced, except in conformity to the plan laid |down.

Atlength the old Indian conit/ted; and one o£the Officers taking a Peti-Ivnifr. from his pocket,and miking the bell fubditute for lather hecould find, performed the operation with greatiuccels, and, as it proved, much to the likingof the old man, w ho, in a few days after, re-pofed a confide lice incur people, cf which theyhad hitherto known no example, by paddlingalong-fide one of the Ihip* in his canoe, and,p lining to his beard. Various art* were;ineffectually tried to induce him to enter the;{hip; but aS he coruiuucd to decline he ’.nvi-j( r3 )tatton, a i>arber r»as fent down into the boatialang-fide thecinoc, fi-om whence, leaning ovcethe gunwa-e, he complied with the wifli of theold beau, to his infinite iausfa&ion. la addi¬tion to the confcqaence« expeiled from thi#k dawn of cordiality, it afforded prcaf that thebeard is coni^dered by thefe people more asj an ihcninbrance than a mark of dignity.The neceilary pievious buhnef* having beenS traniucled, upon an appointed day the Cemmil-lions were read, and pcilbuion was taken ofthe Settlement in form.

such slumber is bliss.Rest, warrior, rest!—rest, warrior, rest! 1THE BONNIE BARK.0! merry goes, 0! merry goes.The bonnie, bonnie bark,’Tis Donald in his plaidy rows,I ken his tartan mark :Sae bonnie stripp’d with red and blue,With red and blue, with red and blue,I’d point it-out ’mang all the crew,Tho’ e’er so far from me.But see he rows his bonnie bark,His bonnie bark sae light,To meet me in the moon's pale light,A faithful laddie he.Then row, row the bonnie bark.The bonnie bark, the bonnie bark,Row, row the bonnie bark,My laddie comes to me.

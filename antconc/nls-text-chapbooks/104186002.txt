And be¬cause some of the members are uncompounded,and entire of themselves, as the tongue, the heart,<fec.. and some are of a mixed nature, as the eyes,the nose, and others ; wo therefore say, that thereare many things which agree and live together,that inform a wise man how to make his judgmentbefore he be too rash to deliver it to the world.Hair.—Hair that hangs down without curling,if it be of a fair complexion, thin, and soft withal,signifies a man to be naturally faint-hearted, andof a weak body, but of a quiet, harmless disposi¬tion. Hair that is big and thick, and short withal,denotes a man to be of a strong constitution, se¬cure, hold, deceitful, and for the most part unquietand vain, lusting after beauty, and more foolishthan wise, though fortune may favour him. Hewhose hair not only curls much but busheth out,and stands on end, if the hair be white, or of ayellowish colour, lie is by nature proud and bold,dull of apprehension, soon angry, a lover of venery,given to lying, malicious, and ready to do anymischief. He whose hair rises in the corner ofhis temples, and is gross and rough withal, is mosthighly conceited of himself, inclined to malice, butcunningly conceals it, is very courtly, and a loverof new fashions. He whose hair is of a reddishcomplexion, is for the most part, if not always,proud, deceitful, detracting, venerous, and full ofenvy. Hair of a yellowish colour, shows a man tobe good conditioned, and willing to do any thing,fearful, shamefaced, and weak in body, but strongin the abilities of the mind, and more apt to ro-THE GOLDEN FORTUNE-TELLER.s onge an injury. He whose hair is of a brownishi >lour, and curled a little, is a well-disposed man,;id a lover of peace.' i Forehead,—The forehead that riseth in a round,: ignifies a man liberally minded, of a good under-i landing, and generally inclined to virtue. Hoi hose forehead' is low and little, is of a good un■ erstanding, magnanimous, confident, and a great' 'etender to love and honour.SI Eye-brows.—Those eye-brows that are muchi 'died, whether in a man or woman, show the per-n is proud, high-spirited, bold, and threatening,id a lover of beauty. Those, on the other side,Ifhose eye-brows are black, and the hair of themat thin, will do nothing without great considera-. ion, and are bold and confident in the performance■ if what they undertake.n Eyes.—He whose eyes are hollow in his head,it one that is suspicious, malicious, perverse in hisi mversation, and of an extraordinary memory.|j ’e whose eyes are, as it were, starting out of hisHead, is a simple foolish person. He who looksiiidiously and acutely, with his eyes and eye-lids■ownwards, denotes thereby to be of a malicious'lature, very treacherous, and false. He who hathp .wandering eye, and which is rolling up andTown, is for the most part a vain, simple, deceitfulman, lustful, treacherous, or high-minded. Hei -hose eyes are twinkling, and which move for-| rard or backward, show the person to be luxurious,ii nfaithful, and hard to believe. They whose eyesIre addicted to be bloodshot, are naturally choleric,roud, cruel without shame, and much inclined touperstition.Thus from the eyes we several things may see,By nature's art of physiognomy ;And this may teach us goodness more to pri.ro,for wher^ one s good, twenty ni*e otherwise.20 THE GOtDEN ^ORTPNE‘TELLEH.Nose.—A long and thin nose denotes a maibold, furious, angry, vain, and credulous, ibottle-nose is what denotes a man to be vain, falseluxurious, weak, and uncertain.

Randall*THE'HISTORYOFj MOLL FLANDERS.THE most remarkab’e account thatX can. give of my parents is, thatrmy father was hanged for felony, andiaiy mother transported for the same,after she was delivered of me in New¬gate: from whence I was taken by so^ue   i gypsies whom I remember, and left meat Colchester in Essex;, where the ma¬gistrates taJcing compassion on me, put-me to a nurse ; .with whom I lived thir¬teen years till such time as she died,and. then being fancied by^a rich gen¬tle-woman for my nice needle-work, Ishared in the education of her daugh¬ters in learning to dance, speak French,and playing music; these qualifica¬tions, together with my beauty, caus-‘ed my lady’s eldest son to pretend loveto me, and at last, with his alluringspeeches and powerful gold, his melt¬ing kisses, and affectionate promisesthat he would marry me as soon as hecame to age, he prevailed upon hie tosurrender my virginity up to him, andto use me whenever he pleased ; butscarce a year had expired before thathis youngest brother pretended love al-iso; in such an open and honest man¬ner, insomuch that all the family toolcnotice of it. How I should make awife to him, and a whore to his eldestbrother, I could not tell without beingijruined ; as loving the latter to extrem¬ity, being with child by him: but inIshort, there happening such disputesbetween the two brothers, it had likento have driven me from the family, butithe eldest brother consented that I[should marry the youngest as not car¬ing to marry me himself, so I privatelywedded him, who the first night hescame so drunk to my bed, that I easily(persuaded him he had done what his[eldest brother had done before him.In two years after he died, leavingme with two children, who were taken’care of by his pa ints, and having thena tolerable good fortune in my ownihands, I married a Draper, who soon /[ was forced from me for debt into Francewhich obliged me to take a lodging in   Ithe Mint, where, in a widow’s habit, ITtook upon me the name of Mrs Flan¬ders. Here I was courted as a mistressby several lewd men, but all these Iscorned, and it was my good fortune tomarry a gentleman whose estate was inVirginia, and whom I deceived by prttending to him I was a greater fortune!than I really was. But indeed hdproved a very good husband, and pre*vailed with me to go over with him into'Virginia, where I was kindly receivedby my husband’s mother. But here Ifound that our family was of the New¬gate train, she shewing me where shewas burnt in the hand, bidding me noti wonder, for that mayor F was aneminent pick-pocket, Justice B r| was a shop-lifter, and Tom W riiwho had so narrowly escaped thenub-bing post was there become an excellent[dissenting preacher.Here I lived about three years with-i«out having children, but not withoutwan inward remorse, as knowing myi second husband was not dead. Andf|this set me upon returning again intohEngland, teasing my spouse for thatpurpose, who wanted to know very!much the true reason of it But I toldhis mother who came to pump me,th^t her story she had told me of her5 being transported, confirmed me in the(belief she was my mother who was^delivered of me in Newgate, and bywhich means she was saved from theigallows. This very much surprisedher, but dreading the thoughts of hav-uag another child hv mv husband- 1 wag8forced to disclose the matter, to excusemy coldness to him in his embraces.Upon-hearing this, he fell into so deepa melancholy that twice he attempted to !hang himself, but was prevented ; andit was with very much difficulty thatI obtained leave from him to return toEngland, which I did in the month ofAugust, after eight years continuance•in that country, hnding at Milford.Haven, in Wales, and in nine weeks?;arrived in London.Some time after I went to Bath, wheremaking my circumstances known, my,landlady lodged and boarded me at avery cheap rate, till the spring, when I,was courted by a gentleman who had awife distempered in her head, and I re- :ceived several presents from him, as a ,hundred guineas at one time, and fiftyat another, for taking care of him in anillness. In short, I found him my best,friend, taking several journies with himitill at length he got me with child, and|.was delivered.of a fine boy, going bynithe name of. Sir Walter Cleave’s JadyfjFrom Bath we returned to Hammer ||smith, near London. Six years I livtkS9three children, till at length he fell sickin a house he had taken for his wifeand family at Bloomsbury. But uponhis recovery I found that I was slighted,no doubt through remorse of c<}n-~I science. Yet he sent me a letter with| a bank note of fifty pounds, promisingI he would take care of my little boy,j but wanting to get the other fifty pound*| of him, I signed a general release, which.I put an end to this affair.But it was not long before it wasI) my fortune to get an acquaintance with| a clerk belongihrrtd'the bank, whoseI wife having made him a cuckold byI keeping company with an officer in the3army, and after that with an apprentice(^belonging to a Draper. I had like tofhave become his bride, promising onI hat account to get a divorce from histher wife.But whilst' this was doing, going!ovvn- into Lancashire, and being im-gined to be a fortune of fifteen thou-and pounds, 1 was married to an Irish[entleman, by a Romish clergyman ;>ut he finding that I had no such effects,.s I, like a false woman, had representedinto him, nor he any estate more than10what he had Spent in his equipage incourting me.He therefore lent me as much moneyas would bear my charges up to Lon¬don, discharged me from the marriage, ]left a letter for me upon the table, andwent away the next morning. Butafter he had discharged his servants hereturned at night, to my joy, and ac¬companied me as far as to Dunstable,where we afterwards parted after mutualinstructions had passed for our futurecourse of life.At London, I lodged at an old mid¬wife’s as being big'with child,' where(as I had given directions) a letter wassent to me out of Lancashire, which hadbeen directed there by the clerk ©f thebank ; who told me he had obtained adecree against his wife, and was at myservice. I returned an immediate answefunder a cover, that I would be in town 'the latter end of the year. And indeedafter having opened the matter to themidwife, and being delivered of a bravdboy, which, with much difHculty, ljallowed her to dispose of, 1 went tc11 ▼| Stone in Lancashire, and so takingcoach, writ a letter, to my clerk to meettne at Brickhill; there in a short time,le prevailed with me to marry him.The next day, from the window of thenn, I beheld my Lancashire husbandvdth two others pass by ; when soonfter, they were all three pursued as:lighwaymen ; but returning safely withjjny husband to town, I lived with himpceeding happy for the space of fivefcrears, by whom I had two children.Afterwards I rewarded my midwife for1 *er fidelity to me. But my husband’sperk robbing him, it flung him intopch a grief, that it immediately ended12his life; which entirely destroyed allmy happiness.Soon after this, being reduced to verygreat extremity, I was tempted to steala small bundle out of an apothecary’sshop’in Leaden hall Street, in w£iich Ifound a suit of child-bed linen, fine lace,a silver mug and spoons, three shillings,and other matters. The next thingthat I did, inveigled a little childaway, from which I took its gold neck¬lace, but though I had it in a privateplace, I would not kill or hurt it, andput it in the way home again. An¬other time I took out of a shop atStephney, two rings, one a diamondring, and the other a plain one: antfas I was once in Lombard Street, athief being pursued, dropped a pieceof silk, which I made off with, and af¬terwards disposed of to a good advafl'Stage, and not as thieves commonly dcfor a song. Another time I stolesilver tankard out of an alehouse, whiclI afterwards sold to aN pawn-brokewho greatly encouraged me in suethings. She shortly afterwards helped me to a mistress, who made m<more expert in the thieving art; bunot more fortunate ; for first, she her¬self with another of her scholars werei;apprehended, and committed to New-jjgate, for stealing three pieces of camb-:bric from a linen-draper in Cheapside.i.Both of them were condemned to die,.but only our scholar was executed;jfor the other came off with what they|call a circuit pardon from the judge.I cannot but reflect upon one crimeIII did in taking from she hands of agentlewoman, a bundle of plate whenher house was on fire, and conveying itto my own house, and. so very fortun-iate was I in escaping, that. I becamelexceeding remarkable among the thievesdor none was so great as Moll Flanders ;ibut at length being threatned to beimpeached by some in Newgate, I cloth-led myself in a man’s habit, though asmooth face (otherwise personal andtall enough) might soon have betrayedjme. My impeacher being discoveredlas he was stealing some goods, was^taken; and I happily escaped. Sometime after this I had the happiness ofI seeing him hanged!14 *My name was as well known at the ‘iOld Bailey, as a remarkable traitor is at kthe Secretary’s office. But being nowan excellent pick-pocket as well as a |strumpet, I took from a cull after I hjid|made him drunk, his gold-watch, with|his silk purse of gold, line perriwig, -sword and snuffbox; and leaping out»of the coach (which stood still to letanother coach pass by) I left my fool tomourn his disaster. This success mademe follow the whoring again, but find- .ing the profits of it too small to supportme, I returned again to my old trade ofshop-lifting.And one time as I was going alongthe street through Covent Garden, therewas a cry of stop thief, stop thief; amercer’s shop having been robbed, andI secured as the transgressor, and mosthaughtily insulted by the mercer andhis servants. In a little time they gotBie right thief, who was much in thesame habit as mine. But for this affi onlI got an hundred andffifty pounds: scthat all this, with my other substancemight have maintained me, but I hav-15 ;|ng got an itch of thieving, could iniio manner leave it off.I had an opportunity of commencing) coiner, but that was such a beggarly,imd yet so dangerous a business, that Fwould never embark in it. Nor couldever yet be brought into the society oflouse-breakers. No person could bemore dextrous in stealing gold-watcheschan I from the ladies’ sides, either atche park, playhouse, or at church. Iwas also very dextrous at gaming, andjut one time cleared 73 guineas. TheJuncommon success I had, made me go[into the country, where at Cambridge,fSturbridge fair, and at New market, Ijpxpertly performed the same pranksrover again; and at Ipswitch I robbed;a(Dutchman of a portmanteau, by pre¬tending to be his wife in an inn, andin which was a very large quantity of'gold and silver.But afterwards coming up to Londonland venturing boldly into a fine silver-jsmith’s shop, while none were there, I|was perceived by a shopkeeper over..the way; but as I had a glance of him16itrso I meddled with nothing, and a jatice of the peace coming by, being caled, cleared me with flying colours.Another time, going into a semstress’ shop in Cheapside, and cheapeing half a dozen of very good hollancshifts, I doubted the length of themupon which* the sempstress slipt onof the smocks upon her, which gavme the advantage to pin it with two othree pins to her petticoat, and takingup the rest, with other parcels of muslin, ran away out of the shop. Tinsempstress then endeavouring to putoff the smock, pulled up her cloutsand running after, cried, stop thiefstop thief! with all she had exposed tcithe public; who taking her for a macwoman, 1 got clear off with my booty*and the sempstress was bantered to heidying day, besides losing to the valuiof fifty pounds worth of muslin.But, after happening to steal somebrocaded silk from a mercer’s shop, \was apprehended and being carried before a justice, was committed to New¬gate, the place of my nativity, when171 b impossiplc for me to express theHorrors of a disconsolate mind.Here the wretches triumphed over:np. What! said they, is Mrs Flandersnine to Newgate1, what, Mrs Mary,md afterwards plain Moll Flanders.Jut I was forced to content myselfVith this piece of Newgate poetry :If I swing by this string,I shall hear the * bell ring,And therehs an end of poor Moll./thnedHere I got into blessed acquaintance,ose company soon made me as hard-as themselves ; and where, to mytmazement, I beheld among them myarmer Lancashire husband, and whoseimisfortunes he placed upon my account,ildere my old tutoress had done what,:.he could for me to make up the mat-;er with my prosecutors ; for she en¬deavored, tho’ to no purpose, to hinderjhe jury from finding a bill of indict-Inent.against me. At the sessions I haddeaded Not Guilty, but. was found*St, Sepulchre’s.18"guilty of felony, and so received sen¬tence of death accordingly.So concerned was my poor gover¬ness, that having repented herself of allher sins, she sent me a minister alsowho represented to me these four im¬portant truths, death, judgment, hea¬ven and hell. When the dead warrancame down, he visited me as before Hthe next day I heard the dismal toll o||St, Sepulchre’s bell, and then was in j19jfomied of my reprieve, the unexpectedIjoy made me immediately fall into a ter¬rible swoon.After this I was put on board in orderfor transportation,: with several othervictims, as they called us, wherewe endured great hardships, as the firstnight lying upon the bare boards, butafterwards were allowed the liberty oflittle cabins if we had any clothes to layIn them. That night the ship fell down;i&,‘,i.nto a place which they call Busty Hole,|roin whence I sent a letter by the boat¬swain, who came on shore, to my go-20ernessJand niy poor Lancashire husband. The next xlay my governesssent me a sea bed, and a chest ; in onedrawer of which was my money ; ancgave nie an answer to that which I sento my husband, who hoped, though hcould not go with me in the same shipjyet to see me in Virginia; but by in-|tercession, he was afterwards put onboard with us, where my money fur;-nished us with good accommodationSo we took likewise several materialswith us, for the work of planting ; ancso we sailed froih the Downs on the13th of April, and arrived safely orthe coast of Virginia, where I soon perceived my own son and my brothe.his father, whom 1 had my husbanctwenty years ago; but my mother haobeen dead some time before, havinleft a considerable plantation to rand my heirs.Many were the ways I pondered orto get from the sight of my family, i:these wretched circumstances ; sincecould not bear the sight of my chilemy brother and husband, who livenear that place I had. taken for my sedement; and upon this very accoui 21lie removed with all our effects intoli .airyland, after a long and unpleasantvoyage. There we bought two servants,i English woman and a Negro man ;f en a piece of ground of fifty acres,hd built a decent house thereon. And(deed our affairs went on very pros-rously, so that we looked upon oneother with pleasure; and then I ob-ned my husband’s consent to go toginia and to discover myself to myother. When I landed, I wrote a letteri him, telling him of several particular?airs j which letter came into his son’snds, who asking the messenger wheregentlewoman was that wrote it, hee to me which was about seven milesattended by two servants on horse-k, and coming to me, kissed me,ing, “ Dear mother are you alive 1”then he fell to weeping,e told me that his father was quiteibeganuated.and beside himself, whichbde him conceal the letter from him ;|it;the plantation which,.my, motheri left me, was ifl-his possession ; sothe produce of it he gave a hundred.inds, engaging to be my trustee and[hful steward. Indeed, in all his22actions he proved a most dutiful chileallotting servants to wait upon me, am|treating me with as great splendor as ifI had been a sovereign princess,presented him with a gold watch, an*jtaking my leave of him, after I had at rquainted him that I intended to marra gentleman who came over with m#I set sail in a sloop my son had providecand came sate to my own plantation!again, bringing over with me thresaddles, some hogs, two cows, andgreat many other things*When I had related all this vcrigood fortune to my husband, he lifteup his hands in an extacy of joy, angave thanks to heaven for this suddeiland so happy a change. Soon aft«this, arrived a cargo from Englandwhich my governess had sentwith three women servants; whiclmade my husband amazed, especial:when I assured him that they we|paid for. How, Says he, was I deceied when I married a wife in Lan<shire, I think I married a fortune, aia good fortune too.23I had taken care to buy those thingss or my husband, which I knew he tookt, delight to wear; as two good longvigs, two silver-hilted swords, three orpur side fowling pieces, a fine saddlei /ith holsters & pistols very handsome,kith a scarlet cloak; and in one word,ijvery thing that I could think on thatihight possibly oblige him, an$ to makeim appear (as he really was) a veryne gentleman. I must not omit in-rming my readers that one of theenches my governess had sent us hap-ened to come double, having been gotith child by one of the seamen in theip, as she owned afterwards, beforee ship got as far as Gravesend; soe brought us a fine boy about sevenonths after our landing.After my brother’s, (or former hus-nd’s) death, my son visited us, wherey dear husband made him most ex-ceding welcome ; and truly no person>iould be blessed with a more dutifulliild.

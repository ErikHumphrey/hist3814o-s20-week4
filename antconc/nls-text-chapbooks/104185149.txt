he takes it cheer'ly.Blest with a smiling ®an of grotr,If duty call,Stands, rise, or fall,lo fate’s last verge he’ll jog:4The cadge to weigh,The sheets belay,He does it with a wish,To heave the lead,Or to cat-headThe ponderous anchor fish ;For while the grog goes round,All sense of danger’s drown’d,We dospise it to a man ;We sing a little, and laugh a little,And work a little, and swear a little.And fiddle a little, and foot it a httle,And swig the flowing can.If howling winds and roaring seas,Give proof of coming dangers,We view the storm, our hearts at ease.For Jack to fear’s a stranger.Blest with the smiling grog we fly,Where now belowW’e headlong go,Now rise on mountains high.Spite of the galeWe hand the sail,Or take the needful reef,Or man the deckTo clear some wreck,To give the ship relief.Though perils threat around,All sense of danger’s drown’d,We despise it to a man;We sing a little, &c.5But yet think not our fate is hard,Though storms at sea thus treat us ;For cpming home—a sweet reward !—With smiles our sweethearts greet us.Now to the friendly grog we quaffOur amorous toast.Her we love most,And gavly sing and laugh.The sails we furl,Then for each girlThe petticoat display ;Tire deck we clear,Then three times cheer,As we their charms survey :And then the grog goes round,All sense of danger’s drown’d,We dispise it to a man ;We sing a little, &c.The Banks of the Devon.How pleasant the banks of the clear winding Devon,With green spreading bushes and flowers bloom¬ing fair !But the bonniest flow’r on the banks of the Devon,Was once a sweet bud on the braes of the Ayr.Mild be the sun on this sweat blushing flowrer.In the gay rosy morn as it bathes in the dew6And gently the fall of the soft vernal shower,That steals on the ev’ning each leaf to renew,O spare the dear blossom, ye orient breezes,VVith chill hoary wing, as ye usher the dawn !And far be you distant, thou reptile that seizesThe verdure and pride of the garden and lawn !Let Bourbon exult in his gay gilded liles,And England, triumphant,display her proudrose;A fairer than either adorns the green valleys,^ here Devon sweet Devon, meandering flows.Lath’d to the Helm.In storms, when clouds obscure the sky,And thunder roll, and lightnings fly,la midst of all these dire alarms,I think, my Sally, on thy charms.The troubled main,The wind and rain,My ardent passion prove ;Lash'd to the helm,Should seas o'erwhelm,I‘d think on thee, my love.When rocks appear on every side,And art is vain the ship to gude;In varied shapes when death appears,7The thoughts of thee my bosom cheers.The troubled main,The wind and rain,My ardent passion prove :Lash’d to the helm,Should seas o'erwhelm,I‘d think on thee, mv love.But should the gracious pow'rs be kind,Dispel the gloom, and still the wind,And watt me to thy arms once more,Safe to my long-lost native shore;No more the main,I‘d tempt again,But tender joys improve;I then with theeShould happy be,And think on nought but love.The Bay of Biscay.Loud roar‘d the dreadful thunder,The rain a deluge show'rs ;The clouds were rent asunderBy lightning's vivid pow'rs:The night, both drear and dark,Our poor devoted bark,There she lay till next day,In the Bay of Biscay, 6.8Now dash'd upon the billow.Her op'ning timbers creak ;Each fears a wat'ry pillow.None stop the dreadrul leak.To cling the slippery shroudsEach breathless seamen crowds,As she lay till the dayIn the Bay of Biscay, O.At length the wish’d-for morrowBroke through the hazy sky ;Absorb’d in silent sorrow,£ach heaved the bittdV sigh.The dismal wreck to view,Struck horror to our crew,As she lay on that dayIn the Bay of Biscay, O.Her yielding timber sever,Her pitchy seams are rent;When Heaven, all-bountous ever,Its boundless mercy sent.A sail in s ght appears,We hail her with three cheers.Now we sail with the gale,From the Bay of Biscay, O.FINIS.

After a smart battle i|dmong themselves, they divided, and ’tis said, theparty who gained this Bucky-battle, fearing the Eng- ■lish law to take place, set northward, and took uptheir residence at this Buck-haven, so called, not Ionly from the great quantity of Buckies that arefound in and about that place, but on account of the :battle they had with their neighbours at Berwick :when they divided, which was then called bucking ;one another, but is now named boxing or fighting. ,Another party of these Bucket's, settled in anothertown northward of Banff, called Bucky, near the 1river Spey, which is a large sea-town, but among \all the sea-tewns in Scotland, the fishers still retain ia language quite different from the people in the !country, and they almost all shift the letter H, and !use O instead thereof, which no country-people do ;in Scotland, but themselves. There is a corruption iof speech in every country over all Britain, and like- ■wise they use different tones and ways of pronounc¬ing words from others, even some in the South ofScotland can hardly be understood by those in theNorth, though both pretend to speak English, andTHE HISTORY OF, &c. 3have a liberal part of education: but since learningis now so easy to be obtained, ignorance and cor¬ruption of speech are greatly decreased.In the county of Fife, on the sea-coast, therestands a little town, inhabited by few but fishers,called Bucky-harbour, because of the sea buckies and -shells to be found so plenty on the rocks, in and a-bout that place. There is little mention made ofthis town by historians, to know its original extrac¬tion and antiquities, but in their own burgess-ticket,which was part of it perfect truths, but more of it byway of lampoon: This ticket was dated the two andthirty day of the month of Julius Caesar} their coatof arms was two hands gripping each other over aScate’s rumple; their oath was, “ I wish the de ilmay tak me an I binna an honest man to you, anye binna de like to me.” An article of good neigh¬bourhood they had, whoever was first up in a goodmorning was to raise all the rest to go to sea, but ifa bad morning, they piss and lie down again tillbreak of day, then raise Wise Willy, who couldjudge the weather by the blowing of the wind.4THE HISTORY OFTheir freedoms were to take all kinds of fish con- Itained in their tickets, viz.' lobsters, partans, podles,spout-fish, sea-cat?, sea-dogs, flukes, pikes, dike-paddocks, and p fish.Among these people were said to be one Tomand his two sons, who were fishers on the coast ofNorway, and in a violent storm were blown over,and got ashore at Ducky-harbour, where they set¬tled, and the whole of his children were called Thom¬sons. This is a historical saying, handed down fromone generation to another. So in course of timethey grew up and multiplied, that they soon becamea little town by themselves; few of any other namedwelt among them, and were all called the Thom¬sons; they kept but little communication with thecountry people, for a farmer, in those days, thoughthis daughter cast awa if she married one of the fish¬ers in Ducky-harbour, and Witty Eppie the ale-wifewad a sworn, be-go’ laddie, I wad rather see myboat and a’ my three sons upset against the Dass, orI saw ony ane o’ them married on a muck-a-byresdaughter, a wheen useles taupies that can do naethingBUCK-HAVEN IN FIFESHIRE.but rive at a tow rock, and cut corn; they can nei¬ther bait a hook nor red a line, hook sandles norgather periwinkles.Now Wise Willy and Witty Eppie the ale-wifelived there, about an hundred years ago. Eppie’schamber was their college and court-house, wherethey decided their controversies, and explained theirwonders, for the house was wide like a little kirk,had four windows and a gavel-door, the wives gotleave to flyte their fill, but fighting was forbidden,(as Eppia said, up hands was fair play;) their fineswere a’ in pints o’ ale, and Eppie sold it at a plackthe pint; they had neither minister nor magistrate,nor yet a burly-bailie to brag them wi’ his tolbooth;my Lord was their landlord; Wise Willy and WittyEppie the ale-wife were the rulers of the town.Now Eppie had a daughter, called Lingle-tail’dNancy, because of her feckless growth, her waistwas like a twitter, had nae curpen for a creel, beingEmbruch bred, and brought up wi’ her Lowdin aun¬ty, was learned to read and sew, made corse-claiths.and calico-muches, there wasna a scholar in the townbut hersel’, she read the Bible and the book ofKirk-sangs, which was newly come in fashion, Willyand Eppie tell’d ay what it meant, and said a’ thethe letters in it, v/as litted by my Lord, for they sawhim hae a feather that he clipped in black water,and made crooked scores just like the same, and6 THE HISTORY OFthen he spoke to it o’er again, and it tell’d him whatto say.It happened on a day, that two of their wivesfound a horse-shoe near the town, brought it hame, iand sent for Wise Willy to see what it was. Willycomes and looks at it, Indeed, co’ Willy, its athing and holes in it. Then, said they, he wouldget a name till't. Aha, co’ Willy, but whair didyou find it? Aneath my Lord’s ain house, Willy.Adeed, said Willy, it’s the auld moon, I ken by theholes in’t for nailing it to the lift-, but I wonder itshe fell in Fife, for the last time I saw her she washinging on her back aboon Embruch: a hech, co’Yv illy, we’ll hae her set up on the highest house inthe town, and we’ll hae moon-light o’ our ain a’ theTHE NEW COLLEGE.days o’ the year. The whole town ran to see themoon: Hout tout, cried Wittie Eppie, ye’re a’ foolstogether, it is but ane o’ the things it my Lord’s marewears upo’ her lufe.At another time, one of the wives found a harewith its legs broken, lying among her kail in theyard; she, not knowing what it was , called outherneighbours to see it, some said it was some gentle¬man’s cat, or my Lady’s lap-dog, or a sheep’s youngkitlen, because it had saft horns: Na, na, cried WiseWilly, it’s ane o’the maukens, that gentleman’s dogswcrrie. What will you do wi’t?

Thewhole town was in an uproar, some would go withpicks and spades and hag him a’ in pieces, otherswad gang and catch him in a strong net, and thenthey could either hang or drown him. Na, na, co’Wise Willie, we manna cast out wi’ him at the first,as he’s gotten the twa burden o’ fish, he’ll able? ganghis wa’ and no fash nae mair, he’s o’er souple to becatclvd in a net, a’ your pith ’ill neither hang himnor drown him, an’ the kintry he comes frae is a,8THE HISTORY OFhet coals, he’ll never burn, we’ll go to him in a eivilmanner, and see what he wants: get out Eppie theale-wife, and lingle-tail’d Nancy, wi’ the Bible andthe Saum-book. SoafF they came in a croud, eitherto kill the de’il or catch him alive, and as they camenear the place the ass fell a crying, which causedmany of them to faint and run back: Na, na, co’Willy, that’s no the deil’s words ava, it’s my Lord’strumpeter touting on his brass whistle. Willy ven¬tured till he saw the ass’s twa lugs: Now, cried Willyback to the rest, come forward and baud him fast,I see his twa horns, hech sirs, he has a white beardlike an auld beggar man; so they enclosed the poorass on all sides, thinking it was the deil: but whenWise Willy saw he had nae cloven feet, he cried out,Fearna’, lads, this is no the de’il, it’s some livingbeast, ’tis neither a cow nor a horse: And what is itthen, Willy? Indeed, co’ Willy, ’tis the father o’ a’the maukens, I ken by its lugs.Now some say, this is too satirical a history, butit is according to the knowledge of those times, notto say in any place by another; old wives will yettell us of many such stories, as the devil appearingto their grandfathers and grandmothers, and deadwives coming again to visit their families, long aftertheir being buried: but this Bucky-haven, which wasonce noted for droll exploits, is now become moreknowing, and is a place said to produce the best andhardiest watermen or sailors of any town on the Scotscoast, yet many of the old people in it still retain theold tincture of their old and uncultivated speech, as,be-go laddie, also a fiery nature: if you ask any ofthe wives where their college stands, they’ll tell youif your nose were in their arse, your mouth wouldbe at the door of it.Now it happened, when Wise Willy turned oldhe took a great swelling in his wame, and casting upBUCK-HAVEN IN FIFESHIRE.9o’ his kail, callops, and cauld fish, that nothing staidon his stomach, and a stout stomach had he, for crab-heads, or scate-brose, or fat-brose on a bridal-morn-ing; yet it fail’d him; he fell sick, and none couldcure him, or tell what ail’d him, till a niountebankstage-doctor came to Kircaldy, that could judge bypeople’s water the troubles of their person, and Wil¬ly, hearing of his fame, pissed into a bottle and sentit away with his daughter. The bottle being un¬corked, his daughter spilt it by the way, and to con¬ceal her sloth in so doing, pissed in it herself, andon she goes, comes to the stage, and cries, Sir Doch-ter, Sir Dochter, there is a bottle o’ my father’s wash,he has a sair guts, never needs to drite ony, he spuesa’ he eats, ’tis true I tell you, my dow. The doctorlooks at it, and says, It is not your father’s, surely itis your mother’s. A de’ils i’ the man, co’ she, div-na I ken my father by my mither? Then, said he,he is with child. A de’it’s i’ the man, co’ she, formy mother bore a’ de bairns before, dats no true sir,a figs ye’re a great liar. Home she came, and toll’dWilly her father that the doctor said he was wi’bairn. O Waes me, co’ Willy, for I hae a mucklewame, and I fear it’s o’er true; O plague on you,Janet, for ye’re the father o’t, and I’m sure to diein the bearing o’t. Witty Eppie was sent for, as shewas houdy, and fand a’ Willy’s wame, to be sure a-bout it. Indeed, co’ Eppie, ye’re the first man e’erI saw wi’ bairn before; and how you’ll bear’t I dinnaken, ye hae a wally wane, weel I wat, but how menbear bairns I never saw them yet, but I would drinksa’t water and drown’t in my guts, for an men getanse the gate o’ bearing weans themseils, they’ll seeknae mae wives: so Willy drank sea-water till his gutswas like to rive, and out he goes to ease himself a-mong the kail, and with the terrible hurl of farting,| up starts a mauken behind him, thinking she was10THE HISTORY OFshot. "Willy sees her jumping o’er the dike, thoughtit was a child brought forth, cries, Come back, mydear, and be christened, and no rin to the hills andbe a Pagan. So Willy grew better every day there¬after, being brought to bed in the kail-yard: but hisdaughter was brought to bed some months thereaf¬ter, which was the cause of the doctor's mistake.PART II."VTOW Wise Willy had a daughter, called Ro-lioching Jenny, because she spoke thick, sixwords at three times, half sense and half nonsense,as her own words and actions will bear witness. Shebeing with child, was brought to bed of a bonnylass bairn: and a’ the wives in the town cried, Be-go laddie, its just like its ain daddy, lang Sandy Ta-son (or Thomson) we ken bv its nose; for Sandy hada great muckle red nose like a lobster-tae, bowed atthe point like a hawk’s neb, and Sandy himself saidthat it was surely his or some ither body’s, but hehad used a' his birr at the getting o’t, to sey his a-bility, being the first time e’er he was at sic a busi¬ness before, and when he had done a’ that man coulddo at it, said, it was nonsense and shamefa’hina,but he wad rather row his boat round the Bass andback again or he did the like again: for Wise Willygade wood at the wean, and said, it had mair ill-na¬ture in’t than the auldest wife about the town, it piss’dthe bed, and sliate the bed, skirl’d like a wil-cat, andkept him frae his night’s rest; and a’ the auld haggsabout the town, ca’d him Sandy de bairns daddy, anda’ the young gilly-gawkie lasses, held out their fing¬ers, and cried, Tie, hte, Sandy, the kirk will kittleyour hips for yon yet.11BUCK-HAVEN IN FIFESHIRE.And after a’ the bleir-ein’d bellman came bladder-I ing about the muttock-mail, summoned him und heri before the hally band, a court that held in the kirkon Saturday morning; and a’ the bred ladies roundabout, cried, Ay, ay, vSandy, pay the bill siller, orwe’ll cut the cow’s tail awa, so poor Sandy sufferedsadly in the Hesh, besides the penalty and kirk pen¬ance.But Wise Willy had pity upon them) and gadei wi’ them to the kirk-court, whet learned folks callthe session, Jenny was first called upon, and in shegoes where all the hally band tvere conveened, eldersand youngers, deacons and dog-payers keeping the; door, the cankerdest Carles that could be gotten be-1 tween Dysart and Dubby-si.le, white heads and baldheads sitting wanting bonnets, wi’ their white-headedstaves and hodden-grey jockey-coats about them.Mess John says, Come away, Janet, we re a wait¬ing on you here.Min.] Now, Janet, where was this child gotten?you must tell plainly.Jan.] A deed s.ir, it was gotten amang tire blackstanes, at the cheek o’ the crab-holes.Mess John stares at her", not knowing the place,but some of the elders did: Then, said he, O Janet,but the de’il was busy with you at that time.Jan.] A by my figs stir, that’s a great lie ye’retelling now, for the de’il wasna thereabout, it I saw',nor nae body else, to bid us do either ae thing oranither, we loo’d ither unco’ w'eel for a lang timebefore that, and syne we tell’d ither, and greed tomarry ither like ither honest fr.uk, than mightna welearn to do the thing marritd'fouk does without thede’il helping us.Whist, whist, cried they, you should be scurged,fause loon quean it thou is, ye’re speaking nonsense.Jan.] The de’ils i’the carles, for you and your12THE HISTORY OFminister is liars, when ye say it de de’il was helpingSandy and me to get the bairn.Come, come, say they, pay down the kirk dues,and come back to the stool the morn, four pound,and a groat to the bellman.Jan.] The auld thief speed the dearth o’t stir, forless might sair you and your bellman baith: O butthis be a hard warld indeed, when poor honest foukmaun.pay for making use o’ their ain a—, ye misca’ay de poor de’il ahint his back, and gie him de wyteo’ a’ de ill it’s done in the kintry, bastard bairns andevery thing, and if it be sae as ye say, ye may thankde de’il for that gude four pund and de groat I haegi’en you, that gars your pots boil brown, and getjocky-coats, purl-handed sarks, and white-headedstaves, when my father’s pot wallops up rough bearand blue water.The woman’s mad, said they, for this money is a’given to the poor of the parish.Jan.] The poor o’ the parish, said she, and that’sthe way o’t, a fint hate ye gie them but wee pick¬less o’ pease-meal, didna I see’t in their pocks, andthe minister’s wife gie’s naething ava to unco beg¬gars, but, bids them gang hame to their ain parish,an yet ye’ll tak de purse frae poor fouks, for nae¬thing but playing the lown awee or they be married,and syne cocks them up to be looked on and laughtat by every body, a de’il speed you and your justicestir; hute, tute, ye are a’ coming on me now, like awheen colly dogs, hunting awa’ a poor ragget.chap¬man frae the door; and out she comes cursing andgreeting.

The .wild hares, they thought, belonged to the same man,as they ran towards his house when they were hunt¬ed. The swine came very often in and about theirhouses, seeking fish guts and ony thing they couldget: so it happened that one of their children, sittingeasing itself, one of the swine tumbles it over, andbites a piece out of the child’s backside: The wholetown rose in an uproar, and after Grunkie, as theycalled her. they catched her and took her beforeWise Willy. Willy takes an ax and cuts two orthree inches off her long nose; Now, says Willy, Itrow I have made thee something Christian dike, thouhad sic a long mouth and nose before, it wad a fright¬ed a very de’il to look at ye, hut now ye’re facedlike a little horse or cow. The poor sow ran homeroaring, all blood, and' wanting the nose, whichcaused Muir-edge to warn them in before my Lord:so the wives who had their kail eaten, appeared firstin the court, complaining against Muir-edge- In¬deed, my Lord, Muir-edge is no a good man, whenhe’s sick an ill neighbour, be keeps black hares andwhite hares, little wee b own backed hares wi’ whitearses, and loose wagging horns, de muckle anesBUCK-HAVEN IN FIFESHIRE.15loups o’er the dyke and eats a de kail, and de littleanes wi’ de wagging horns, creeps in at our watergush-holes, and does the like, when we cry pisue,they ran awa’ hame to Muir-edge, but I’ll gar mycolly haud ’em by the fit, and I’ll baud ’em by thehorn, an pu’ a’ de hair aff ’em, and send ’em hamewanting the skin, as he did wi’ Sowen 'Fammy’s wi’Sandy, for codding o’ his pease, he took aft' de poorladdie’s coat, a sae did he een. .A well then, said my Lord, what do you say; butcall in Wise Willy.In he comes, A well, my Lord, I shall supposean ye were a sow, and me sitting d—g, and you tobite my arse, sudna I tak amends o’ you for that?Od, my Lord, we wadna hae sic a bite out o’ yourarse for twenty merks, ye maun .just gar Muir edgegie ten merks to buy a plaister to heal the poor bitwean’s arse again.

Lang Sandy was provost, and JohnThrums, the weaver, was dean of guild, but WittyEppie had ay the casting vote in a’ their courts andcontroversies.There happened one day a running horse to standat one of their doors, and a child going about, thehorse trampled on the child’s foot, which caused thepoor child to cry. The mother came running in apassion, crying, A wae be to you for a ’orse it ere yewas born o’ a woman, filthy barbarian bruit t’ou is,setting your muckle iron lufe on my bairn’s wee fit-tie, od stir, I’ll rive the hair out o’ your head, grip¬ping the horse by the mane and the twa lugs, cullinghis chafts as if he had been her fellow-creature, cry¬ing, Be-go laddie, I’ll gar you as good, i’ll tak youbefore Wise Willy the bailie, and he will cut aff yourhand wi’ de iron lufe, and dan you will be cripple,and gang through the kintry on a barrow, or on twashule-staffs like Rab the Randy, an a meal-pock a-bout your neck. Her neighbour wife hearing andseeing what past, cried, A ye fool taupy, what garsyou sav that a ’orse was born o’ a woman, do youthink dat a ’orse has a fadder or a mither like you orme, or ony ither body about.

Wise Willy and the Bridegroomserved the table, and cried, Sup and a sorrow to you,for I never liked sour kail about my house; whenthe flesh came, the bride got a ram’s rumple to pick,she takes it up and wags it at my Lord, saying, Tihie, my Lord what an a peice is that?

Indeed my Lord,there is a reason for dut, I hae scabbit hands.

Very well said, says my Lordthat’s good sense or something like it.Dinner being over, my Lord desired the bride todance; Indeed, my Lord, I canna dance ony, butI’ll gar my wame wallop foment yours, and then rinround about as fast as ye can; very well, said he,bride, that will just do, we shall neither kiss norshake hands, but I’ll bow to you, and ye’ll beck tome, and so we’ll have done.Now, after dinner and dancing, my Lord exhort¬ed the bride to be a good neighbour, and to greewell, wi’ every body round about, I wat well myLord, ye ken I did never cast out wi’ nae body butlang Pate o’ de Pans, an he was a’ de wyte o’t, it be¬gan wi’ a hiertieing, and a jamffing me about Sandy,de black-stanes and de crab-holes, where de weanwas gotten, and then it turn’d to a hub-bub and col-ly-shangy, an or e’er ye wad said kiss my arse, my20THE HISTORY OFLord, we were aboon ither on the mussel midden, Itrow I tell’d him o’ Randy Rob his uncle, his feif-tittv it steal’d de sarks and drank de siller, an how/his midder sell’d manky mutton, and mair nor a’that, a, sae did I een, my Lord.My Lord had a friend of his own who was a cap¬tain in the army, who came to visit him, and hearingof the Backer’s sayings and exploits, was desirous tosee them, and my Lord as desirous to put them ina fright, sent his servant, and ordered them, bothmen and women, to come up before his gate, direct¬ly the morn about kail-time, and all that did notcome, was to flit and remove out of my Lord’sground directly, this put the whole of them in greatterror, some ran to Wise Willy to see what it mean’d;Willy said, it was before something, and he wassure that death would be the warst o’t, come whatwill; But Witty Eppie said, I ken weel what’s tocome, he’s gaun to mak de men a’ sogers, and thewives dragoons, because we’re de best fighters; I kenthere is something to come on the town, for ourNancy saw Maggy’s gaist the streen, it was bury’dfour ouks syne; a hech, co’ Willy, that’s a sign themeat is dear i’ the ither warld, when she comes tothink on’t again; we will tak our dinner or we go,we’ll maybe ne’er come back again, so away theywent lamenting all in a crowd. My Lord and theCaptain were looking out at the window to them, theCaptain cries to them, To the right about, to whichthey answered, good bliss you, my Lord, what doesthat man say? Then said my Lord, turn your face toMaggy Millheads, and your arse to the sea; this theydid all in haste. And what will we do now? saidWilly; no more, said my Lord, but gang away homeWilly; O my bows, O my blessings come o’er yourbonny face, iny Lord, I wish you may never die,nor yet grow sick, nor naebody kill you: ye’ne theBUCK-HAVEN IN FIFES HIRE.21best Lord I ken on the earth, for we thought a’ tobe made dead men and sogers, ye’re wiser than a’the witches in Fife.There was in Bucky-harbour, a method, whenthey got a hearty drink, that they went down todance among the boats; one, two, or three of theoldest, went into a boat to see the rest dance; when¬ever they admitted a burger, there was always adance. One day they admitted gly’d Rob Thomsonfrom the island of May, and after he was admittedthey got account from Wise Willy that gly’d Robwas a witch, which made them all stop their dancing,and Rob was cried on to make answer to weightymatter. Gly’d Rob cried, none of you shall stir afit for two hours, I’se warrand you; so Rob spang’dand jumped over the boat several times, and putthem to great terror; some cried, O ’tis ith’ the air,and then they cried they saw him ith’ the air hang¬ing; so Rob was obliged to go back to the May, amicarry coals to the light-house.It was reported that gly’d Rob was born in Buc-ky, and that his father was Willy Thomson’s son,who was banished for a slave to the May, to carry22THE HISTORY OTcoals-, he would not take with him, on account hehad but ae eye. After that, there was no moredancing at admitting of burgers-, but the old usualway of scate-rumple, and then drink until they werealmost blind.Upon the Rood-day, four young Bucky lasseswent away early in the morning with their creels .full of fish: about a mile frae the town, they sawcoming down a brae, like a man driving a beast,when they came near, Tardy-Tib says, ’tis a mandriving a big mauken. Tib flang her creel and fishaway, the other three ran another way, and got clear,they said it was a horned de’il. Tib told the fright-some story, and many ran out to see the poor man(or cadger and his ass) driving the auld mauken. •The fishers look on all maukens to be devils andwitches, and if they but see a sight of a dead mauken,It sets them a trembling. The fisher lasses look withdisdain on a farmer’s daughter, and a’ country lasses,they call them muckbyres and sherny tail’d jades.The Bucky lads and lasses when they go to ga- :ther bait, tell strange stores about Ghosts, Witches,Willy with the Wisp, and the Kelpy, Fairies andMaukens, and boggles of all sorts.The Ghosts, like old horses, go all night for fearthey are seen, and be made to carry scate or fish orBUCK-HAVEN IN FIFESHIRE.23be carted; and witches are the warst kind of devils,and mak use of cats to ride upon, or kili-kebbers,and besoms, and sail over the seas in cockle-shells,and witch lads and lasses, and disable bridegrooms.As for Willy and the Wisp, he is a fiery devil, andleads people off their road in order to drown them,for he sparks sometimes at your feet, and then turnsbefore us with his candle, as if he werer twa or threemiles before us, many a good boat has Spunkiedrown’d; the boats coming to land in the night-time,they observe a light off the land, and set In upon itaftd drown.The Kelpy is a sly devil, he roars before a lossat sea, and frightens both young and old upon theshore. Fairies are terrible troublesome, they gangj dancing round foukslums, and rin through the housesthey haunt, and play odd tricks, and lift new bornbairns from their mothers, and none of them is safeto lie with their mothers, a night or two after theyare born, unless the mother gets a pair of men’sbreeches under her head for the first three nights;when the Fairies are frighted, they will leave an oldstock with the woman, and whip away the child.One tried to burn an old stock that the Fairies leftin the cradle; but when the fire was put on, the oldstock jumped on upon a cat and up the lum. Mau-kens are most terrible, and have bad luck, none willgo to see that day they see a Mau'-en, or if a wretch¬ed body put in a Mauken’s fit in their creels, theyneed not lift them that day, as it will be bad luck,either broken backs, or legs, or arms, or hear badaccounts of the boats at sea.They are terrified for all sorts of boggles bothby land and by sea.24. THE HISTORY OF, &c.yThe Minister and Mussel Mou'd Harm.Mussel Mou’d Harry, the skull maker, whose lugwas nail’d to a tree near my Lord’s garden, for cut¬ting young saughs, for to make sculls and creels of.He assumed a head dress as he had been a devil,and went playing his tricks in the night-time, whichfrighted the whole town, untill the time he wascatched by my Lord’s piper. He was then sentfor to the minister, and was obliged to put on hisfrightful dress, with the appearance of two hornsin his head; the minister rebuked him, but he hadthe assurance to tell the minister, that he not onlyfrighted his own town, but that he frighted thewhole parish, by telling them to repent or be d—d,this is your gate o’t stir, so I made them to repentby fright, and I think, I sud be paid by your honourfor’t; as you tell me stir about my Lord’s saughswhich I suffered for, if your ’onour’s lug had beenthere, you could not get off so easy, for stir, yourlugs is as long as my grey cat’s, so I bid you fareweluntil our next meeting.IFINIS.1

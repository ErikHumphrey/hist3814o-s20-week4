To see if he would take him in,and all his company.To see if he w»uld accept of him,and all his jolly sailor’s bold.And for a ransom he would give,two thousand pounds in gold.First he beguil’d the wild Turk,and then the king of Spain,Prav how can he prove true to us,when he prov’d false to them.O no, O no, then said the king,f^r no such things can be,For he has been a rank robber,and a robber on the sea.O then, says Captain Ward my boys,let’s put to sea again,/ind see what prizes we can findon the coast of France and Spain.Then we espied a lofty ship,a sailing from the west.She was loaded with silks and sattins,and cambrics of the best.Then bore we up to her straightway,they thinking no such thing;We robb’d them of their merchandise,and bade them tell their king.Now when our king did hear of this,his heart was griev’d full sore,To think his ships could not get pass’d,as they had done before.Then he caus’d build a worthy ship,and a worthy ship of fame,And the Rainbow was she called,and the Rambow was her name.He rigged her and freighted her,and sent her to the sea,TWith two hundred and fifty mariners!to bear her company.They, sailed east, they sailed west|but nothing could espy,Until they came to the very spot,where Captain Ward did lie.Who is the owner of this ship?the Rainbow then did cry;0 here am I, said Captain Ward,1 let no man me deny.What b-ought you here you cowardly dog?you ugly wanton thief, .What makes you lie at anchor,and keep our k.ng in grief.You lie, you lie, said Captain Ward,ao well as f hear you lie,1 never robb’d an Englishman,an Englishman but three.As for the worthy Scotsmen,I love them as mine own,My chief delight is for to pullthe Franch and Spaniards downWhy shyest thou so, thou bold robber,we’Jl soon humble thy pride,oWith that the gallant Rainbow,gave Ward a broadside.Full fifty good brass cannons,well charg’d on every side,And then they fired their great guns,and gave Ward a broadside.Fire on, fire on, says Capt?in Ward,I value you not a pin;If you be brass on the outside,I’m as good steel within.They fought (row eight in the morning,till eight o’clock at night,Till once the galiant Rainbow,began ro take her flight.Go home, go home, says Captain Ward,and tell vour king from me,If he reigns king on dry land,I will reign king at sea.With that the gallant Rainbow,she shot and shot in vain,Then left the Rover’s company,and home returned again.Tell our royal king of England,his ship’s returned again,/<Fcfr captain Ward he is too strong,he never will be ta’en.O everlasting shame, said the king,I have lost jewels three, : iWhich would have gone unto the sea,and brought proud Ward to me.The first was brave Lord Clifford,great Earl of Cumberland,The second was my Lord Mountjoy,as you shall understand;The third was brave Lord Essex,from field would never flee.Who would have gone unto the sea,and brought proud Ward to me.MAGGY LAUDER.Wha wadna be in lovewi’ bonny Maggy Lauder?A piper met her gaun to Fife*an’ spier’d what was’fthey ica’d her;Right scornfully she answer’d him,begone, you hallamhaker.Jog on your gate, vcu bladderskate,my name is Maggy Lauder.107Maggy, quoth he, an’ by my bags,I’m fidgin’ fain to see thee;Sit down by me, my bonny bird,in troth I winna steer thee;For I’m a piper to my trade,my name is Rob the Ranter,The lasses loup as they were daft,when I blaw up my chanter.Pipet, quoth Meg, ha’e you your bags,or is your drone in order;If you be Rob I’ve heard of you,live you upon the border?The lasses a’ baith far an’ near,ha’e heard o’ Rob the Ranter;I’ll shake my foot \vi’ right good will,gif ye’ll blaw up your chanter.f Then to his bags he flew ivi’speed,•about the drone he twisted;Meg up an’ wallop’d o’er the green,for brawly could she frisk it.Weel dune, quqth he, play up, quoth she,weel boo’d, quoth Rob the Ranter,’Tis \»orth my while to play indeed,when I hae sic a dancer.Weelhae you play’d your part, quoth Meg,your cheeks are like the crimson;There’s nane in Scotland plays sae weel,since we lost Habby Simpson.6I’ve liv’d in Fife, baith maid an’ wife,these ten years an’ a quarter;Gin ye ahou’d come to Anster fair,speer ye for Maggy Lauder.THE BEGGAR GIRL.Over the mountain, and over the moor,Hungry and barefoot I wander forlorn;My father is dead, and my mother is poor,And she grieves for the days that will never return.Pity kind gentlefolks, friends of humanity,Cold blows the wind, and the night’s coming on;Give me some food for my mother in charity,Give me some food and I will be gone.FINIS.

I cross’d the DardanellesUpon my journey back,Where old King Neptune dwells.And drives his five-horse hack.Talk no more, &c.oThus did my sportive brain,Conduct me to each star,Where, as I hurried on,I lit a new cigar ;But when the vision fled,About the dawn of day,By my troth, I was safe in bed.And never a mile away !Talk no more, &c.THE CHARMING WIDOW.I am a charming widow now,In age just twenty-two,And being rid of my former vow.New lovers come here to woo.There’s many a one with flattering tongue.Of high and of low degree ;But he that is both brisk and young,Is the brisk young man for me.There’s, &c.Last time I wed an husband old,About fourscore or more ;But then his purse was lined with gold.Which woman-kind adore!He’s dead and gone to his narrow home-So there let him quiet be.And now my heart is free to roam.So a brisk young man for me,There’s, Ac.GTHE CARLE HE CAM’ OWER THE CEAFThe carle he cam’ ower the craft,Wi’ his heard new-shaven ;He looked at me as he’d been daft—The carle trowed that I wad hae him !Hout awa ! I winna hae him !Na, forsooth, I wiima hae him !For a’ his beard’s new-shaven,Ne’er a hit o’ me will hae him,A siller brooch he gae me neist,To fasten on my curchie nookit;1 wore’t a wee upon my breist,But soon, alake ! the tongue o’t crookit;And sae may his ; I winna hae himNa, forsooth, I winna hae him !Twice-a-bairn’s a lassie’s jest ;Sae ony fool for me may hae him.The carle has nae fault but ane ;For he has land and dollars plenty ;Bnt waes me for him, skin and baneIs no for a plump lass of twenty.Hout awa, I winna hae him !Na, forsooth, I winna hae him !What signifies his dirty riggs.And cash, without a man wi’ them ?But should my cankert daddie garMe tak him ’gainst my inclination,I warn the fumbler to bewareThat antlers dinna claim their station.Hout awa !

The Corn Laws,A New Song-,To which is added,THE LAND OF THE THISTLE.GLASGOW.Published, and Sold Wholesale and Retail, byR Hutchison 10. Saltmurke^NEW CORN LAWS—A Song.Tune.—The Factor's Garland.sr T'T'p ' " ‘r** ■ *'r trri / ^ *■; j rj ■ rY--IIn the year eighteen hundred and fourteen,we hearThat a new corn bill on the stage did appear;Rut so many petitions against it were sent,That our great corn lawyers saw meet to repent.Meantime they a grand commitee did appoint,To examine the matter, and all things disjoint,For farmersand Landholders all should make rich,If trademen of all kinds should die in a ditch.Next season this grand committee did report.That no farmer could live without shutting eachport,When the quarter of grain was sold under fourpounds.Unless the landholders would lower their grounds.O then, said the Landholders, we must proceedTo get a bill pass’d with all possible speed.For we are determin’d our rents to uphold.As \vc must still ride in our chariots of gold.3But petitions against it were sent in so fast.That the t ible cou d no; the.n contain at the last;So they w re ohlig’d to pile them in the hall,Yei still they proceeded in spite oi them all.!For sta esmen and landholders all did agree,To starve the poor tradesman, you p ainly may see;Yet without sui’h people they never could stand,And that they will find, when they’re forc’d fromthis land.Ye statesmen and courtiers pray be not So fast,i On your constituents such insults to cast,ij But feelingly pomier the Case of the poor,1 Who e fervent petitions are now at your door.For twenty long years we great hardships haveborne, ■ t'!: By laws made for raising the price of the corn.Of which it appears many thousands of bolls1 Have in granaries been kept till unfit for ourmouths.Ye judges and rulers, a word in your ear,'JThere are many old laws in our country, I hear,fFor punishing those who provisions forestall,iTray execute these, and relieve us from thrall.It is not many years since petitions were sent,/'from all kinds of tradesmen, their wages to stent,w4So that they might live by the sweat of their brow;But these you rejected, and why not this too?But because ye’re determin’d the poor to sup¬press, »And the health of the Landholder still to increase,Such partial proceedings I ne’er knew before,I pray you desist from what all does abhor.What tho’ the Landholders did pay ten percent,If they on the farmers did lay double rent,Xhtir income was greater than when they paidnone,And all came upon the poor tradesman alone. |For the farmers did treeble the price of their jcheese,Their eggs and their butter, their beans and their jpease,And so from their shoulders the burden did east,And all came upon the poor tradesmen at last.A certain great courtier a traitor became,And ruined his country for the love of gain;O plague come upon him and all that he has.Because he deserted the poor tradesman’s cause.And faulsely reported the minds of the placeWhich he repreientetl, t© his disgMe*,5But better I ne’er did expect from the man;Now 1 the poor turn-coat no farther will scan,But leave the poor mortal to bear his disgrace.In hopes that a better will soon fill his place;But thanks to Lord Archibald, who always prov’dtrue' mAnd the good of his country kept still in his view.But I trust the Prince Regent will yet interfere,When he sees the nation against it so clear,And ne’er give consent to this much hated law.And make its abettors of him stand in awe.And the constitution keep still on the base,Which king William laid, while the world didgaze,Admiring the structure as they past it by.But never could reach to a summit so high.This beautiful fabric let no man pull down.That wields Britain’s sceptre, or wears Britain’scrown,For it was rear’d up by much labour and pain.And for it our forefathers bled on the plain.Now may peace and plenty our country per¬vade,And may we still flourish ia all kinds of trade;6So that we in comfoit our days yet may spend.And our constitution see pure to the end.But what do I hear, we’re completely deceiv’d,And of our last hopes are entirely bereav’d,For now the P  R has sanctionedthe bill, $And we his poor subjects must bear all that’s ill.But let us take comfort, there’s One above all,Whose ears are still open to his people’s call,And their just petitions by him shall be heard,For the more they ask of him, the more’s theirreward.He many a time has oppressors brought low,For proof you may look into Judges, and knowHow Sisera and Eglon, and many beside.By him were destroyed for oppression and pride.Now let us request him to grant us relief,From all our oppressions, our sorrows and grief,For this lie has promis’d, and will not deny,But give to his people who on him rely.7THE LAND OF THE THISTLE.Tune.—Black Jock.YOU rmy talk of the land that gave Patrick hisfame,1 The land of*the Ocean and ^nglean Name,IWith the red blushing roses and shamrock sogreen,Far dearer to me are the hills of the north.The land of blue mountains, the birth-place of, worth.Those bleak hills where freedom has placed herabode,And those wide spreading glens where noislaveever trode,Where grows^ the red heatherAnd Thistle so green.i Though rich be the soil where blossoms the rose,i And bleak arc our mountains, and covered withsnows,Where grows the red heather and Thistlesogreen;lYet, for friendship sincere, and for loyalty true,l And for courage so bold, that ne’er foe couldsubdue,Unmatched is our country, unrivalled our swains,i And lovely and true are the Nymphs on our plains,Where grows the red heatherAnd Thistle so green.Far famed are our sires in the battles of yore,And many a cairney does rise on our shore,O’er the foes that invaded the thistle so green;And many a cairmy shall rise'o’er our strand,Should the torrent of war ever pour o’er our land.For let foe come on foe, like wave upos wave,TVe’ll gi’ethem a welcome, we’ll gie them a graveBeneath the red heatherAnd thistle so gfetn.Oh! dear to our souls are these blessings of he.ven,The land which we boast off,—that land whiwe live in,The land of the thistle,—the thistle so green;For that lard, and that freedom, our foiefathetjbled,And we swear by the blood that our fathers harjshed,That no foot of a foe shall e’er .tread on the]grave, *But the thistle shall bloom o’er the bed of tjjbrave.The thistle of Scotland,The Thistle so green.D.

Her parentsdying when she was young, left her to ramble abroadat her will ; and she supported herself chiefly bybegging. It was then strongly remarked in her, thatshe made observations on person’s features and man¬ners ; she would sit up whole nights when the atmo¬sphere was clear, and seemed as intent on consideringthe. stars, as the greatest astrologers would be w iththeir glasses ; this kind of study gave her a greatknowledge of the weather, the alteration of the air.ci.nil the effect it had ; and from her sometimes casuallyacquainting the neighbouring farmers of any changewhich usually took place, her fame began to spreadwhen young, and she was consulted by them on almostevery occasion ; not a farmer would go to plough, nota sower would put the seed in the ground, withoutfirst asking the opinion of the young gipsy (for sothey then styled her), and following according to herdictates.Her fame now began to spread, and Bridget’sprescience became more universal; other personsbesides the farmers and her neighbours came toconsult her ; and the truth of her predictions madeher veracity gain ground, and she became the topic ofconversation of the politest circles, many of whomcame in their equipages to consult her; and shenever asked for any particular sum, so the unboundedgenerosity of those who applied to her oracles, put herin possession of more money than was suflacient tomaintain her.As she grew in years, like the generality of oldfolks, she became fond of dumb animals, which wereher chief companions, and of these she always had avery great number ; people, indeed, have said aboutone hundred, and others have declared she could call jas many on the earth as she pleased, but this isfabulous, for I never saw more than ten at any time.Dogs and cats were the principal companions of herretirement, which, being of the smallest breed, would,as she sat, creep from different parts of her garments,and not a little to the surprise of those who came tosee her, and, indeed, frightened many, though to do jher justice, she desired her visitors not to be terrifiedat her domestics as she termed them, for they werenot like many th.'.t attended on the gentry, saucy,imperious, and unfaithful, but were always attendanton the will of her whose hand fed them, nor wouldinjure without provocation, a lesson, she used to say,she wished was learned by all mankind.Of a pipe of tobacco our Bridget was exceedingly I'fond, and, indeed, was continually whiffing; and as |Eshe humourously used to observe, she had “ sent limore puffs into the world than all the quacks in the jakingdom.” From a long, contracted habit, likewise, L7when she was smoking, of ever being seated so thather knees almost touched her visage, her limbs becameso contracted, that when she became old in years, shewas almost double, which, together with her enormouslength of nose and chin, her pipe, and the number ofanimals about her, made her cut a most hideous figure,and appear rather uncommonly terrifying to those whowere not apprised of it.Though this famous old woman had never beentaught to write, yet by long practice, she had formedto herself, a kind of hieroglyphical characters, inwhich she deciphered her observations, knowledge,and remarks; these I found concealed within thethatch of her cave ; but, as they were so unintelligibleI thought it would be impossible to make head or tailof such a heap of monsters and other figures as wereattempted to be drawn, and as I am rather of astudious turn, I thought as I had made it my businessformerly to transcribe the Egyptian hieroglyphics,which, when they were as unintelligible to me asthese, I might by perseverance get at the depth ofthis valuable manuscript, or at least it would serve todeposit in the British Museum, as the remains of awoman who was so famous, and whose name was sowell known among mankind.I was, therefore, determined immediately on renew¬ing my labours with redoubled ardour and unweariedapplication, and at length, as perseverance and resolu¬tion will conquer difficulties, I soon found the wholemystery was opened unto me. Think of my joy—notthe miser who has found a treasure he supposed lost,not a maiden who finds her lover returned after along voyage, whom she thought perished in the waves,but finds restored to her arms with love and fidelity,not —but a truce with metaphors. It is enough to tellthe reader that I was at length enabled to read thisvaluable work, and found by experience, that hermaxims and remarks, her observations and judgment,have been extensive, are true, are strongly character¬istic, and would do honour to the most experiencedastrologers.Nature sometimes in her roughest coat drops herbrightest jewel, which for a long time lies hidden, tilldeveloped by some experienced adept. So we may8obaerve of our authoress, that though clothed in themeanest garb, nature showed herself in her abilities,and left it for me to hand down to posterity whatwould otherwise have been lost in oblivion.Thinking, therefore, so precious a jewel should notremain long hid, but shed its lustre to all eyes, Iimmediately set about putting it into English, whichat length I have accomplished, and usher it into theworld, requesting the gentle reader to excuse myliteral errors; and if he reaps any benefit from thisproduction, I shall not think my labour ill bestowed,though all the merit is due to the deceased authoress.MOTHER BRIDGET.Hite Hnte Jforhme Heller.An Explanation of the Circles of the SphereAND SOME OTHER TERMS OF ASTROLOGY, FORthe Easier Understanding of this Book, andfurther Information of the Reader.The Equinoctial Circle, Equator, or Equinox, is agreat circle or line equally distant from the two polesof the world, dividing the sphere in the midst.Zodiac is a broad oblique circle, crossing the equi¬noctial in two opposite places, viz., in the beginningof Aries and that of Libra, so that one half declinestowards the south. In this circle is comprehended thetwelve constellations or signs, every sign containingthirty degrees in length, and twelve in breadth. Notealso, that the first six are northern signs, and the lastsix are southern signs.The Ecliptic Line, is a line imagined to go along inthe midst of the Zodiac as a girdle, out of which thesun never goes ; but, the moon and other planets aresometimes on the one side and sometimes on the otherside, which is called their latitudes, only the fixedstars alter not their latitudes, whether great or small;but the longitude of a star is the arch, or parts of theecliptic in degrees, between the beginning of Ariesand the circle which passeth through the body ofAries, and the circle which passeth through the bodyof the stars, where 11 the circles of the sphere or10heavens, whether they are large or small, have 360degrees allowed to each of them.Colours are said to be two great moveable circles,crossing each other at the poles of the world, onecutting the equinox at the beginning of Aries, Cancer,and Capricorn, and so dividing the globe into fourequal parts.Horizon is a great circle passing through the poleof the world, and the poles of the horizon, called theZenith and Nadir (which are two points, one directlyover our heads, the other directly under our feet), onwhich the sun is always just at noon, and to go directlynorth and south the meridian is changed ; but to goeast or west, it is changed to sixty miles, either waymakes one degree, or four minutes of time differenceunder the equinox, viz., sixty miles eastward, it isnoon four minutes sooner; and sixty miles westward,four minutes later.Tropics are supposed to be two lesser circles,parallel with the equinoctial, and distant from it oneither side twenty-three degrees thirty-one minuteseach ; the ecliptic line touches the tropics of Canceron the north side of the equinoctial, and it touchesthe tropics of Capricorn on the south side thereof, sothat the sun hath his motion between these two circles.The Arctic Circle is equally distant from the NorthPole, as the tropics are distant from the equinox—twenty-three degrees thirty-one minutes.The Antarctic Circle is the same distance from theSouth Pole.Zones, so called, are five in number, to cold, twotemperate, and one hot, which are divided by thetropics and polar circles from each other ; the hotzone is counted between the two tropics that areextended from one to the other, being about forty-seven degrees, two minutes broad; the temperate zonesare extended from the tropics, on either side, to aboutforty-two degrees, fifty-eight minutes, that is north¬ward to the Arctic Circle, and southward to the Ant¬arctic Circle, and the two cold zones are each withinthose two small circles, having the poles for their centre.The Poles of the World—two points exactly oppositeto each other in the heavens, one in the north, theother in the south, the earth being in the midst, so11Iiat it seems to turn about as if it were borne up byem ; therefore, by some it is termed the axle-tree ofe world, as if there was a line supposed to be drawnom one pole through the centre of the earth to theher pole, and the earth turning thereon; thougholy Writ tells us “ The Lord hangeth the earth upon>thing, it being upheld by his mighty power.” Theale Arctic, or North Pole, is elevated above our>rizon about fifty-one degrees, and the stars withinat distance from it never set with us, but keep theircourse round it daily ; so, likewise, those that are thatdistance from the South Pole never rise with us, butperform their course in the like order.Azimuths are supposed lines, or circles of distance(from the meridian, drawn from the zenith to anydegree, or two degrees of the horizon, or according tothe thirty-two points of the mariner’s compass, sothat in travelling or sailing any way, supposing acircle to go from our zenith directly before us to thehorizon, is the azimuth, called the vertical point, aswell as the zenith.Almicanthourats, or Almadarats, or Circles of Altitude,are imaginery lines passing through the meridianparallel with the horizon.Sphere is a round body representing the frame ofthe whole world, as the the circle of the heaven andthe earth. This is sometimes called a martial sphere,for the orbs of the planets are called their spheres,that is, the circles in which they move.Ascension is the rising of any star, or any part ofthe ecliptic above the horizon. Decension is its goingdown.Right Ascension of a star, is that part of the equinoxthat riseth or setteth with a star in the right sphere ;but an oblique sphere, is that part of the equinoctialin degrees, containing between the first point of Aries,and that part of the equinoctial which passeth by themeridian with the centre of the star.Oblique Ascension is a part of the equinoctial icdegrees containing between the beginning of Ariesand that of the equinox, which rises with any star orpart of the ecliptic in an oblique sphere.Essential Difference is the difference between theright and oblique ascension, or the number of degrees12Contained between that place and the equinox thatriseth with the centre of a star, and that place ofthe equinox that cometh to the meridian with the samestar.Solistice is in the summer when the sun is in thebeginning of Cancer, and in winter when the sunenters into Capricorn; because, then the days seem tostand still, and seem neither to increase or decreaseabove two minutes in ten or twelve days.Constellation is a certain number of stars supposedto be limited within some form or likeness; as Ariesthe Ram is said to have thirteen stars ; Taurus theBull, thirty-three ; Arcturus, Orion, and the Pleiades,mentioned in Job ix. 9, are said to be constellatiads.Planets are the seven cratique, or wandering stars,called Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Venus, Mercury, Sol,and Luna. These planets have also their severalmotions, as—Direct, is a planet moving in its natural course,which is forward.Retrograde, is their moving backward, contrary totheir direct motion.Combust is their being under the sun’s beams, orwithin eight degrees of it.Oriental, is when a planet riseth before the sun—Occidental, after him.Latitude of the earth is the distance or breadth oneither side of the equinox towards the pole, and theythat are under the equinox have no latitude, but the ,poles of the world are in the horizon. This is a rightsphere, and every sixty minutes directly north andsouth are said to make a degree of latitude in an Ioblique sphere; as London is counted to be in fifty-one degrees, thirty-two minutes, the pole thereofbeing exalted as much. The like is to be observed inany other place or region.Longitude of the earth is the outside thereof, extend¬ing from west to east, crossing the latitude at rightangles ; the beginning of which (according to someastronomers), is the Canary Isles, so going eastwardquite round the world, unto the same place again,which is 360 degrees ; and under the equinoctial isreputed to be 29,600 miles, reckoning sixty miles to adegree : but the further off the equinoctial, the fewer18miles in a degree ; for at London about thirty-sevenmake a degree of longitude, so these degrees grow lessand less until they meet at the latitude of ninety, thatis under the poles.Parallels—the lines straight and circular, equallydistant from each other, as the equinox, tropics,degrees of latitude, etc.Climate or Clime, is such a space of earth compre-hended between two parallels, in which space there ishalf an hour difference in the sundials and length ofthe days.A nlipodes are those whose feet are directly againstours, as if a line were drawn from one through thecentre of the earth to the other.And this shall suffice for an explanation, which Ihave done as briefly as I could for the advantage ofthe reader, to whom possibly, these things so neces¬sary to be known, may have hitherto been concealed.Of the Planet at. y Days and Hours, and How toKnow what Planet Anyone was Born under.The planetary hours are those hours in which eachplanet reigns, and has the chief dominion, of which,the ancients gave the following account:—Saturn is lord on Saturday ; Jupiter on Thursday ;Mars on Tuesday; Sol on Sunday; Mercury onWednesday ; Venus on Friday, and Luna on Monday.On Saturday, the first hour after midnight, Saturnreigns, the second Jupiter, the third Mars, the fourthSol, the fifth Venus, the sixth Mercury, the seventhLuna, and then again, Saturn the eighth, and so on toMars the twenty-fourth ; and then Sol beginneth thefirst hour after midnight on Sunday, Venus the second,and so on ; Luna the first on M onday, and Saturn thesecond ; Mars the first on Tuesday, Sol the second,and so forward, planet by planet, according to theirorder, by which every planet reigns the first hour ofhis own day, and so likewise, the eighth, fifteenth,and twenty-second ; as for instance, Saturn reigns thefirst hour, the eighth, fifteenth, and twenty-second onSaturday, Sol the same hours on Sunday, Luna thesame on Monday, Mars the same on Tuesday, MercuryA TABLE OF THE PLANETARY HOUR OF EVERYDAY IN THE WEEK.PLANETS.Saturn .Jupiter .MarsSol . .Venus .MercuryLunaSUNDAY.12 1913 2014 218 15 229 16 2310 17 2411 18.MONDAY.2 9 16 233 10 17 244 11 185 12 196 13 207 14 211 8 15 22TUESDAY.6 13 207 14 218 15 229 16 2310 17 2411 1812 19WEDNESDAY.3 10 17 244 11 185 12 196 13 207 14 211 8 15 222 9 16 23THURSDAY.14 218 15 229 1610 17 2411 1812 196 13 20FRIDAY.4 11 185 12 196 13 207 14 211 8 15 222 9 16 233 10 17 24SATURDAY,8 15 229 16 2310 17 2411 1812 196 13 207 14 21, J’1.18 18 80 easy that it needs very little explanation, its use is to find what planet rules anvhour of the day, and every day m the week ; as for example—I desire to know what planet ruleson Wednesday at 8 o clock at night—under Wednesday I look for 20, which answers to 8 o’clockat night; for the natural day, consisting of 24 hours, begins at midnight, so that from 12 at noonyou begin to reckon 13, 14, 15, 16, etc., you find that the 20th hour from midnight answers to8 o clock at night, over against which, on the left hand, you find Sol, which shows that to be thehour of the sun. And if you would know what planet rules at seven in the morning of that davyou will find it against 7, which shows that Venus rules that hour ; and so of any hour in the day.’15the same on Wednesay, Jupiter the same on Thursday,and so Venus on Friday, which I have thus set.But I shall now come to speak of the significationof the planetary hour of each planet, and what iti portends to them that are born in them.The hour of Saturn is strong, is good to do all thingsthat require strength ; such as fighting, bearingburdens, and the like ; but for those things it is very(evil. He that is born in the hour of Saturn is slow,rdull, melancholy, of dogged temper and disposition,black and swarthy complexion, being quanelsome,wrathful, and very malicious.The hour of Jupiter is in all things good, and denotesjpeace, love, and concord. He that is born in the houriof Jupiter is of a ruddy and sandy complexion, fairihair, well-proportioned body, and of a lovely counten-|ance; his face rather broad than long. He is also cour-ious, of a very affable carriage, moral, and religious.The hour of Mars is evil, and denotes the personin it to be of a choleric disposition, and of a[robust strong body, soon angry, and hard to beireconciled; his face red, and his eyes sparkling andfiery, much addicted to fighting, and ready to quarrelwith every man he meets, which often brings him toan untimely end.The hour of the Sun signifies great strength, veryfortunate for kings and princes. He that is born inthis hour has sharp eyes, brown hair, and a round face,denotes one that is a great projector, aims at greatthings, but is often disappointed, and seldom bringshis design to pass.The hour of Venus is very propitious and fortunate,but it is better by night than by day, especiallymid-day, for the Sun covers it. He that is born inthis hour has fair hair, soft eyes, a little forehead,and a round beard, very complaisant in his carriage,i mighty amorous, a great admirer of women, much>1 addicted to singing and dancing, and spends his moneyin courting.SThe hour of Mercury is very good, but chiefly fromthe beginning to the middle. He that is born in thishour, has stature inclining to tallness, a sharp, longface, large eyes, a long nose, his forehead narrow, along beard and thin hair, long arm and fingers, of a1(5good disposition and obliging temper, much given toreading, and very desiro is of knowledge, delightingto be among books, very eloquent in his speech, and !yet addicted to lying, anil if he is poor, he is commonlylight-fingered.The hour of the Moon is both good and evil, accord¬ing to the day ; for from the fourth to the seventeenthit is good to those that are born under it; but fromthe seventeenth to the twentieth it is counted unfortu¬nate to be born under it; and from the twentieth toto the twenty-seventh very happy. He that is bornin the hour of the moon (especially upon her own day)shall be pale faced, of a thin meagre visage, withhollow eyes, an l of a middling stature; he appears ]very courteous and obliging, but is very crafty anddeceitful, variable in his humour, malicious, and his 1constitution phlegmatic.Thus I have given the reader the judgment ofancients upon the planetary hours, and what theyportend to those that are born under them, by whicha person comparing himself to what is here set down,may easily know under what planet he was born.Ok the Birth of Children with respect tothe Age of the Moon.To be born on the first day of the new Moon is veryfortunate, for to such all things shall succeed-well;their sleep will be sweet, and their dreams pleasant;they shall have long life and increase of riches.A child born the second day of the new Moon shallgrow apace, but it will be much inclined to lust,whether it be male or female. On this day also, allthy dreams shall quickly come to pass, whether theybe good or bad. It is also good on this day to open avein if there be occasion.A child born on the third day of the Moon, shall diesoon, or at least short-lived ; on this day to begin anywork of moment is unfortunate, for it seldom comes toa good conclusion.On the fourth day of the Moon the child that is bornshall prosper in the world, and be of good repute. Onthis day it is good to begin any enterprise, provided17it be done with good advice, and with dependance onon heaven for a blessing.The fifth day of the Moon is unfortunate ; and thei: child that is bom therein shall die in its infancy. HeIS that is in danger, and thinks to escape this day shallcertainly be mistaken. If good counsel be given theei;o-day, take it, but execute it to-morrow. This day0 thou may let blood with good success.The sixth day of the Moon, the child that is bornj shall be of long life, but very sickly. To send children1 to school on this day is very fortunate and denotes«hey shall increase in learning.C'l On the seventh day the child that is born may liveor years ; on this day it is good to shave the head, to,me wild animals, and buy hogs, for he that doth sohall gain much by them. He that takes physic thisyiiay is likely to recover.On the eighth day a child born shall be in danger ofying young; but if he survives his first sickness, hehall live long and arrive at a great estate. He thatreams a dream shall quickly have it come to pass.yiMriything that is lost shall be found.0 On the ninth day the child that shall be born will1 pe very fortunate, enjoying long life and arriving toThreat riches. What thou do each day shall come to aXitood issue; he that is pursued shall escape, and heii|hat groans under the burden of oppression, shall beopportunely relieved. Do not let blood on this dayi jfor it is dangerous.“I On the tenth day a child that is born shall be a greattraveller, pass through many kingdoms and regions,Ij.nd a last die at home in his old age. Do nothing onhis day but what you would have known, for allecrets shall be brought to light.On the eleventh day of the Moon the child that isorn shall be of a good constitution, and be mightilyevoted to religion, shall be long-lived, and of a lovely:ountenance; and if it be a female, she shall bendowed with wisdom and learning. On this day itgood to marry, for the married couple shall beappy all their lives, and be blessed with manyhildren.if The twelfth day of the Moon’s age, in allusion tohe twelfth sign of the Zodiac, betokeneth nothing butsorrow and woe ; and the child born this day shall begiven to wrathfulness, and subject to many afflictions.On the thirteenth day the child that is born shallbe of a short life, and by reason of peevish crossness,never be pleased. To wed a woman on this day isgood, for she shall be both loving and obedient to herhusband.On the fourteenth day the child that is born shallbe an enemy to his country, and seek the destructionof his prince, which will bring him to his deservedend. On this day if you give to a sick man physic, itshall restore him to his former health.On the fifteenth day the child that is born shallquickly die. On this day begin to work for it isfortunate. That which was lost yesterday will befound this day.On the sixteenth day the child born shall be of illmanners, and very unfortunate, insomuch that thoughhe may live long, yet his life will be a burden to him.It is not good to dream on this day for they are com¬monly hurtful, and such as come to pass a long timeafter.On the seventeenth day the child that shall be bornwill be foolish to that degree, that it shall be almost anatural, and thereby become a great affliction to itsparents; yet to contract matrimony, compound physicalpreparations, and take physic is very good ; but by nomeans let blood.On the eighteenth day the child that shall be born,if male, will be violent, courageous, and eloquent;and if female, chaste, industrious, and beautiful, andshall come to honour in her old age.On the nineteenth day the child then born, if a male,shall he renowned for wisdom and virtue, and therebyarrive to great honour ; but, if a female, she will be ofa weak and sickly constitution, yet she will live to bemarried.On the twentieth day the child that shall be bornshall be stubborn, quarrelsome, and a great fighter,yet he shall arrive to great riches and a great store ofmoney.On the twenty-first day the child that is bornwill be unhappy, and though he will be witty andingenious, yet he shall be addicted to stealing. He19that is minded to keep his money, ought on this dayto abstain from gaming, else he may chance to lose all,Abstain from bleeding this day.On the twenty-second day the child born shall befortunate and purchase a good estate ; he shall alsobe of a cheerful countenance, comely, and religious,and shall be well loved.On the twenty-third day the child bom shall be ofan ungovernable temper, and will give himself up towandering abroad in the world, and seeking his fortunein foreign parts, and in the end shall be mistaken.This is a good day to choose a wife ; for he that canmeet with a good woman on that day, should marryher while he can have her.On the twenty-fourth day the child then born shallbe a prodigy in the world, and make all men admirehis surprising wonderful actions, which shall exceedthose of the ordinary sort of men.On the twenty-fifth day the child then born shall bewicked ; he shall encounter with many dangers andat last will perish by them.

Put on the truelid, and say,—“I will command all the seed out of this box,and order a living bird to appear.” Then take off the coverstogether, and the bird will be seen.TO WAKE AN EGG TUMBLE.Put a pennyworth of quicksilver into a quill, and seal it atboth ends with wax; then boil an egg hard, and as soon asyou take it out of the water, put your quill through a smallhole in the narrow end; put the egg on the table, and it willtumble about as long as the heat remains.A CURIOUS METHOD OF RESTORING A FLY TO LIFE IN TWOMINUTES, THAT HAS BEEN DEAD TWENTY-FOUR HOURS.This wonderful experiment is produced from a very simplecause. Take a fly, put it into a glass or cup of water, coverit so as to deprive it of air. When you perceive it to be quitemotionless, take it out, and put it into a place exposed to thesun, and cover it with salt, in two minutes it will revive andfly away.TO MAKE WATER FREEZE BY THE FIRESIDE.This curious feat can only be performed in winter. Set aquart pot upon a stool before the fire, throwing a little waterupon the stool first. Then put a handful of snow into thepot, having privately conveyed into it a handful of salt. Stirit about for eight or nine minutes with a short stick, and thecongelation will be effected.4TO TAKE A BIRD OCT OF A CAGE, AND TO MAKE IT APPEAR ASIF IT WERE DEAD, OR TO ROBB IT ABOUT AS YOU PBEASE.Lay the hivcl upon a table, and wave a small feather beforeits eyes, it will immediately seem as dead; remove thefeather, and it will revive as soon. Let it lay hold of thestem part of the feather with its feet, and it will twist andturn about just like a parrot; you may then roll it about uponthe table at your pleasure.TO PURIFY BAD WATER.Five drops of sulphuric acid put into a full quart decanterof bad water, will cause the noxious particles to fall to thebottom. Twenty drops of diluted vitriolic acid will answerthe same purpose. The water should stand two hours, andthen pour off about three parts for use; the rest throw away.TO SUSPEND A QUART POT PROM THE CEIBING, AND CUT THESTRING IN THE MIDDLE, WITHOUT THE MEASURE TABBINGTO THE GROUND.You must lay a wager upon this, and then tie the stringin a loop about the centre. Having done this, cut the loop,and the quart pot will of course remain suspended.TO GIVE EGGS A PINE VARIEGATED APPEARANCE.Cut up about a couple of handfuls of different coloured ragsinto small strips, mix them together indiscriminately, and com¬pletely envelope the egg in them; then tie the whole up ina piece of cloth, and boil them for three or four hours.Take them up, and on uncovering the egg, the shell will befound dyed in a beautiful manner, with all the colours of therags. Eggs thus variegated form very handsome ornamentsfor the mantel-piece.TO CHABK A RING ROUND A PERSON THAT HE CANNOTGET OUT OF.This trick, extremely simple as it is, causes much mirth ina party. Tell the company that you have the power to placeany person in the middle of the room, and to chalk a ringround him that he cannot get out of, use as much labour andexertion ns he may, without actually undressing himself.This will naturally cause much wonder, some one of the partywill, doubtless, put your powers to the proof. Make suchparty stand in the middle of the room, button his coat, thenwith a piece of chalk make a ring round his person upon hiscoat, wliich it is evident he cannot get out of without takinghis coat offiTHE ENCHANTED COCK.Bring a cock into a room with both your hands close to hiswings, and hold them tight; put him on a tabic and point hisbeak down as straight as possible; then let any one draw aline, with a piece of chalk, directly from bis beak, and all thenoise you can possibly make will not disturb him for sometime, from the seeming lethargy which that position you havelaid him in has effected.TO SUSPEND A KING BY A BURNT THREAD.The thread having been previously soaked two or threetimes in common salt and water, tie it to a ring not largerthan a wedding-ring. When you apply the flame of a candleto it, though the thread burn to ashes, it will yet sustain thering.A CONCEIT TO PRODUCE LAUGHTER.Take a ball in each hand, and, stretching your hands nsfar apart as you can, bet with any one in the company thatyou shall make both balls come into either hand he pleases,without bringing your hands together; as it appears rather adifficult feat, your bet will be readily taken up. You thenaccomplish the feat and win the wager by simply laying theball in the one hand on the mantel-piece or table, and,turning yourself half round, taking it up with the other.THE TRAVELLING EGG.Take a goose’s egg, and, after opening and cleansing it,put a bat into the shell; glue it fast on the top, and the batwill cause the egg to move about in a manner that will excitemuch astonishment.THE SIMPLE DECEPTION.Stick a little wax upon your thumb, take a by-stander bythe fingers, show' him a sixpence, and tell him you will putthe same into his band ; then ring it down hard with yourwaxed thumb, and, using many words, look him in the face:suddenly take away your thumb, and the coin will adhere toit; then close his hand, and it will seem to him that the six¬pence remains; now tell him to open his hand, and if youperform the feat cleverly, to his great astonishment, he willfind nothing in it.TO PRODUCE A COLOUR WHICH SHALL APPEAR AND DIS¬APPEAR BY THE INFLUENCE OF THE ATjfbSPHERE.Put into a decanter some volatile spirit, in which copperfilings have been dissolved, and it will produce a fine blue6tincture; if the bottle be stopped, the colour will immediatelydisappear, but when it is unstopped the colour soon returns.This experiment may be repeated frequently.TO JUKE AN EXPLODING BUBBLE.If you take up a small quantity of melted glass with a tube,(the bowl of a common tobacco pipe will do,) and let a dropfall into a vessel of water, it will chill and condense with afine spiral tail, which being broken the whole substance willburst with a loud explosion, without injury either to the partythat holds it, or to him who breaks it; but if the thick end bestruck, even with a hammer, it will not break.HOW TO LIFT UP A FLINT GLASS BOTTLE WITH A STRAW.Take a straw which is not broken or bruised, and havingbent one end of it into a sharp angle, put this curved end intothe bottle, so that the bent part may rest against its side;you may then take the other end and lift up the bottle by it,without breaking the straw, and this will be the more readilyaccomplished as the angular part of the straw approachesnearer to that which comes out of the bottle.TO JUKE A CONE OR PYRAMID MOVE UPON A TABLE WITHOUTSPRINGS OR ANY OTHER ARTIFICIAL JIEANS.Eoll up a piece of paper or any other light substance, andput a lady beetle, or some such small insect privately underit; then, as the animal will naturally endeavour to free itselffrom its captivity, it will move the cone towards the edge ofthe table, and as soon as it comes there will immediately returnfor fear of falling; and by thus moving to and fro, will occasionmuch sport to those who are unacquainted with the cause.TO MAKE A PEG THAT WILL EXACTLY FIT THREE DIFFERENTKINDS OF HOLES.Let one of the holes be circular, another square, and thethird oval, then it is evident that any cylindrical body of aproper size may be made to pass through the first hole per¬pendicularly, and if its length bo just equal to its diameter, itmay be passed horizontally through the second or squarehole; also, if the breadth of the oval be made equal to thediameter of the base of the cylinder, and its longest diameter ofany length whatever, the cylinder being put in obliquely, willfill it as exactly 113 any of the former.THE JIYSTERIOUS BOTTLE.Pierce a few holes, with a glazier’s diamond, in a commonblack bottle; place it in a vase or jug of water, so that theneck is only above the surface, then with a funnel fill thebottle, and cork it well while it is in the jug or vase. Takeit out, and, notwithstanding the holes in the bottom it willnot leak ; wipe it dry, and give it to some person to uncork.The moment the cork is drawn, to the party’s astonishment,the water will begin to run out of the bottom of the bottle.THE MAGIC SPOON.Put four ounces of bismuth in a crucible, and when in astate of complete fusion, throw in two ounces and a half oflead, and one ounce and a half of tin; these metals will com¬bine, and form an alloy fusible in boiling water. Mould thealloy into bars, and take them to a silversmith to be madeinto tea-spoons. Place one of them in a saucer, at a tea-table, and the person who uses it will be not a little astonishedto find it melt away as soon as he puts it into the hot tea.TO PUT A PENNY-PIECE TINDER A CANDLESTICK., AND TOWITHDRAW IT WITHOUT LIFTING IT UP.This appears a wonderful trick, and yet it is one of themost simple, and never fails to raise a hearty laugh. Placea penny piece under a candlestick on the table, then bet anyone of the party that you will take it from under it withoutlifting up the candlestick. Thinking it impossible, some will,no doubt, accept your wager; this being done, knock threetimes sharply under the table, saying, “Presto, fly, begone!”then tell your antagonist it is gone, and desire him to lift thecandlestick to satisfy himself, this, of course, he will imme¬diately do ; then, on the instant he raises the candlestick,snatch up the penny piece. You will then win the wager, asyou did not take up the candlestick.TO MAKE A MAGIC PICTURE.Take two level pieces of glass, plate glass is the best, aboutthree inches long and four wide, exactly of the same size; layone on the other, and leave a space between them by pastinga piece of card, or two or three small pieces of thick paper, ateach corner. Join these glasses together at the edges by acomposition of lime slaked by exposure to the air, and whiteof an egg. Cover all the edges of these glasses with parchmentor bladder except at one end, which is to be left open to admitthe following composition. Dissolve by a slow fire, six ouncesof hog’s lard, with half an ounce of white wax, to which youmay add half an ounce of clear linseed oil. This must be8poured in in its liquid state, and before a fire, between tbeglasses, by the space loft in the sides, and which you are thento close up. Wipe the glasses clean and hold them beforethe fire, to see that the composition will not run out at anypart. Then fasten with gum a picture or print painted onvery thin paper, with its face to one of the glasses, and if youlike, you may fix the whole in a frame. While this mixturebetween the glasses is cold, the picture will be quite concealed,but become transparent when held to the fire, and as thecomposition cools it will gradually disappear.TO MAKE A SHILLING TURN UPON ITS EDGE ON THE POINT OFA NEEDLE.Take a wine or porter bottle, and insert in the mouth acork, with a needle in a perpendicular position. Then cut anick in the face of another cork, in which fix a shilling, andinto the same cork stick two common table forks, opposite toeach other, with the handles inclining downwards; if the rimof the shilling be then placed upon the point of the needle, itmay be turned round without any risk of falling ofij as thecentre of gravity is below the centre of gravitation.THE TRANSPOSABLE PIECES.Take two farthings and two sixpences, and grind part ofthem away on one side only, so that they may be but half thecommon thickness; and observe, that they must be quite thinat the edge; then rivet a farthing and a sixpence together.Lay one of these double pieces, with the sixpence upwards,on the palm of yonr hand, at the bottom of your three firstfingers, and lay the other piece, with the farthing upwards,in the like manner, in the other hand. Let the companytake notice in which hand is the farthing, and in which is thesixpence. Then, as you shut your hands, you naturally turnthe piece over, and when you open them again, the farthingand the sixpence will appear to have changed their places.A CANDLE CONVERTED INTO CARBURETTED HYDROGEN GAS.When a candle is burned so low as to leave a tolerably largewick, blow it out; a dense smoke, which is a compound ofhydrogen and carbon, will immediately arise ; then, if anothercandle or lighted taper be applied to the utmost verge of thissmoke, a very strange phenomenon will take place; the flameof the lighted candle will be conveyed to that just blown out,as if it were borne on a cloud, or, more properly speaking, likea flash of lightning proceeding at a slow rate.9TO PRODUCE AN ELECTRIC SPARK FROM A PIECE OF BROWNPAPER.Thoroughly dry before the fire a quarter of a sheet of ratherstrong brown paper, place it on your thigh, holding it at theedge with one hand, while with the cuff of the sleeve of theother you rub it smartly back and forwards ten or fifteen times;if the knuckle be then placed near the paper it will emit abrilliant spark, accompanied with a snapping noise; theprongs of a fork similarly placed, will produce three distinctstreams of light. The experiment must, of course, be per¬formed in the dark, and the trousers and coat be of woollencloth,TO WALK UPON A HOT IRON BAR.Take half an ounce of camphor, dissolve it in two ouncesof aqua vitae, add to it one of quicksilver, one ounce of liquidstorax, which is the droppings of myrrh, and prevents thecamphor from firing; take also two ounces of bematis, whichis red stone, to be had at the druggists, and w’hen you buy itlet them beat it to a powder in their great mortar, for beingvery hard it cannot well be reduced in a small one; add thisto the ingredients already specified, and when you purpose towalk upon the bar, anoint your feet well with it, and you maythen put the feat into execution without the slightest danger.TO MAKE AN EGG STAND ON ONE END ON A TABLE ORLOOKING-GLASS.To make an egg stand on end on any polished surface seemsvery extraordinary, yet is to be done even on a looking-glass; now, from the form of an egg, nothing is more liableto roll, and on nothing more than a looking-glass. To accom¬plish this trick, let the performer take an egg in his hand, andwhile he keeps talking and staring in the faces of his audience,give it two or three hearty shakes, this will break the yoke,which will sink to one end, and consequently make it moreheavy, by which when it is settled, you may make it, with asteady hand, stand upon the glass. This would be impossiblewhile it continued in its proper state.TO PLACE A LIGHTED CANDLE UNDER WATER, WITHOUT EX¬TINGUISHING IT ; OR A HANDKERCHIEF, WITHOUT WETTINGIT.Take a glass, and fastening a small bit of wood across themouth, stick thereupon a piece of caudle lighted, and, with asteady hand, convey the glass to the surface of the water;then push it carefully down, and the candle may be seen10burning under the water, and it may be brought up againalight.In the same manner you may put a handkerchief rolled tighttogether and it will not be wet. The principal art in perform¬ing this feat consists in the nicety of bringing the mouth ofthe glass exactly level with the surface of the water; for, ifit be put the least on one side, the W'ater will rush in, andconsequently defeat the object.The experiment, simple as it is, may serve in some degreeto elucidate the principle of the diving-bell, as it is contrivedmuch in the same way.TO TELL A PEBSON WHERE HE HAS DEPOSITED THE LAST OPTHE THREE GIVEN KNIVES.In order to make this trick appear plausible, wager any sumwith a person that you will give him three knives to hide(one at a time,) and you will tell him where he will depositthe last. It generally happens with the person who acceptsof this wager, to make stipulations to hide them out of theroom, which you readily agree to, and on your presenting tohim, in a careless manner, the tirst and second knife, he runsout, and carefully deposits them in some secret hole or corner,though not the least consequence is attached to them in word¬ing the wager.During your opponent’s absence backward and forward,whip the third knife into the fire, and by the time he is pre¬pared to accept of it, have it moderately heated; he will thennaturally enough deposit it on the ground, with a few ejacu¬lations incident to a person in his situation, while you exclaim,“ There, there it is, on the ground—I knew where you woulddeposit it. So I have wmn the wager.”TO MAKE A WATCH STOP AND GO AT THE WORD OF COM¬MAND.Borrow a watch from any person in company, and requestof the whole to stand around you. Hold the watch up to theear of the first in the circle, and command it to go. Thendemand his testimony to the fact. Remove it to the ear ofthe next, and enjoin it to stop. Make the same request ofthat person, and so on, throughout the entire party.Explanation.—You must take care in borrowing the watchthat it be a good one, and goes well; have concealed in yourhand a piece of loadstone, which, as soon as you apply it tothe watch, will occasion a suspension of its movements, whicha subsequent shaking and withdrawing of the magnet willrestore.I*11For the sake of shifting the watch from one hand to theother, apply it when in the right hand to the left ear of theperson, and when in the left hand the right ear. But if youcan slip the loadstone up and down your sleeve, by using onehand, the feat is more curious.TO TELL THE NUMBER THOUGHT OE BY A PERSON.Desire the person to take one from the number thought of,and to double the remainder, then bid bim to take one fromthis double, and to add it to the number thought of; in thelast place, ask him to tell you the number arising from thisaddition, add three to it, and the third of the sum will be thenumber required. For example—Let the number thought ofbe 6, if 1 be taken from it, there will remain 5, the double ofwhich, 10, being diminished by 1, and the remainder 9 beingincreased by 6, the number thought of, the result will be 15,if to this we add 3, we shall have 18, the third part of which,6, will be the number required.TO TELL WHAT REMAINS AFTER WORKING A QUESTION IN ADDI¬TION, SUBTRACTION, MULTIPLICATION, AND DIVISION, ANDYOU NOT KNOWING ANY OF THE FIGURES BUT THOSE USEDIN THE ADDITION.Desire any pcrsoc to think of a number; then ask him todouble it; then name some number which he is to add to it;then ask him to take away half of the whole amount, andthen deduct the figure first thought of, and the remainderwill be just half the number you told him to add. For in¬stance, let the figure thought of be 8, doubling it makes 16,adding six to it (as you tell him to do, and that is the onlyfigure you know in the whole process of working the question,)gives 22; take away half, and 11 is left; from this deduct 8,the figure first thought of, and 3 remain—that is the half ofthe sum you ordered to be added.TO MAKE A BALL OR LOAF OF BREAD DANCE UPON ATABLE.Having a quill filled with quicksilver and stopped close,you secretly thrust it into a hot roll or loaf, which will put itin motion.By means of quicksilver, many ludicrous feats may be per¬formed.An old lady on a Sunday was making dumplings, when twourchins, her grandsons, came to visit her, and being archlydisposed, while her back was turned, conveyed some quick-12Silver into the dough, and then took their departure. Theancient dame left the care of the cooking to her granddaugh¬ter, and betook herself to church, charging her to be carefulin skimming the pot, wherein were contained the dumplingsand a leg of mutton. The girl was very watchful to obeythose injunctions, and taking off the cover, when the potboiled, out popped a dumpling, which she put in again, when outbounced another, and another after that, so terrifying the girlthat she ran with all her speed to the church. Grandmotherseeing her come, shook her head, winked at her, as much asto say, “ begone! ” At last the girl cried out before the wholecongregation, “All your nodding and winking is in vain, forthe leg of mutton has kicked the dumplings out of the pot.”Feats performed through the medium of quicksilver shouldbo executed with the greatest caution, as there is some dangerattending them.TO CUT AND TEAR INTO PIECES A HANDKERCHIEF, AND TOMAKE IT WHOLE AGAIN.This feat, strange as it appears, is very simple: the per¬former must have a confederate, who has two handkerchiefs ofthe same quality, and with the same mark, one of which hethrows upon the stage to perform the feat with. The per¬former takes care to put this handkerchief uppermost in mak¬ing up a bundle, though he affect to mix them together pro¬miscuously. The person whom he desires to draw one of thehandkerchiefs, naturally takes that which comes first to hand.He desires to shake them again to embellish the operation,but in so doing, takes care to bring the right handkerchiefuppermost, and carefully fixes upon some simpleton to draw;and if he find that he is not likely to take the first that comesto hand, he prevents him from drawing by fixing upon another,under pretence of his having a more sagacious look. When thehandkerchief is torn and carefully folded up, it is put under aglass upon a table placed near a partition. On that part ofthe table on which it is deposited is a little trap, which opensand lets it fall into a drawer. The confederate, concealedbehind the curtain, passes his hand within the table, opens thetrap and substitutes the second handkerchief instead of thefirst; then shuts the trap, which fits so exactly the hole itcloses, as to deceive the eyes of the most incredulous. If theperformer be not possessed of such a tabic, (which is abso¬lutely necessary for other feats as well as this,) he musthave the second handkerchief in his pocket, and by slight ofhand change it for the pieces, which must be instantaneouslyconcealed.♦13HOW TO TAKE THREE BALLS OFF TWO STRINGS.White the balls are examining, you double each string, andeach appears to have two even ends; you twist the doubleend of each together, and putting on one of the balls whichhas a hole smaller than the others over the place that is join¬ed, the strings remain firm, and can bear to be pulled. Eachperson that holds, thinks he has the extremities of two strings,while in fact he has only the ends of one. By a jerk the mid¬dle ball comes off, followed by the rest; you then slip theminto the hands of one of the persons who holds the strings;he of course lets go his hold, and you then take care to putthe strings lengthways. This is a clever feat when performedadroitly, but it requires no slight degree of dexterity to con¬ceal the deception. Formerly the feat was performed withthree button moulds on two small whip cords of about twofeet each, and with three rings upon two ribbons, but the ballsand tapes are preferable.MAGIC SQUARES.A magic square consists of numbers so disposed that inwhatever way you may add the numbers which the squarecontains, they will give the same amount, whether it be ver¬tically, horizontally, or diagonally.The first one hundred numbers so disposed as to produce 505v;hen added upwards or crossways.10 9211 IS71704151403081100931829 2862 6352 5342 4332798993378838784773744546727145857636465665261594 95968675354555662516648724 233447576474179798 9913 12226959493972685849387383 823 2197803160506121209114No. I61No. 4.62THE MAGIC CARDS.No. 2.62No. 5.171819No. 3.1562 63No. 6.3539434751555963The best method of using the abovo is to cut away the leaf,and paste each of the six divisions on a separate slip of stiffcard; present these cards to the person whose age you wishto tell, and desire him to return you all those on which hisage is marked; add together the first figures of each cardreturned, and the amount will be the exact age of the person.Thus, if his age should be 27, he will return you Nos. 1, 2, 4,and 5, these being the only cards on which 27 is marked, andby adding the first figures of each of these together, viz.,1,2, 8, and 16, you obtain 27—the age required.15TIIE MAGIC TAPER ORACLE.Some amusement may be created among young people, bywriting with common ink, a variety of questions, on differentbits of paper, and adding a pertinent reply to each, writtenwith nitro-muriate of gold. The collection is suffered todry, and put aside till an opportunity offers for using them.When produced, the answers will be invisible; you desire'different persons to select such questions as they may fancy,and take them home with them; you then promise, that ifthey are placed near the fire during the night, answers willappear beneath the questions in the morning; and such willbe the fiict, if the papers be put in any dry warm situation.TRICKS WITH CARDS AND DICE.TO TELL ANY CARD IN TIIE TACK.This is an excellent trick, and though quite simple, will befound to astonish an audience in which it is not known. .Seatyourself at table or elsewhere, so as to have the whole of thecompany as much as possible in front of you. Take the packof cards as it usually lies, and, in passing it under the tableor behind you, steal a glance at the card which happens to beexposed; then, pretending to shuffle the cards, place the oneyou have seen back to back on the other side of the pack, andholding the cards firmly by the edges, raise your hand betweenyou and the company, and show the card you have seen, tellingat the same time, what it is. While doing so, observe whichcard is facing you (for you have now the whole pack facingyou except the one card which is shown to the spectators,)pass them under the table again, and transfer the card whichyou have just seen to the other side of the pack, handling thecards as if shuffling them; again exhibit, and cry out thename of the card turned to the company, taking care to noticethe card that faces yourself, which, change as before, and soon, by which means you may go over the whole pack, tellingeach card as it is exposed, without ever looking at the cards,except when they are held up between you and your specta¬tors, and when they are anxiously looking at them themselvesto see whether you are right or not.TO TELL A CARD THOUGHT OF BLINDFOLD.Take twenty-one cards, and lay them down in three rows,with their faces upwards; i. e. when you have laid out three,begin again at the left hand, and lay one card upon the first,1Gand so on to the right hand; then begin on the left hand again,and so go on until you have laid out the twenty-one cards inthree heaps, at the same time requesting any one to think ofa cai'd. When you have laid them out, ask him which heaphis card is in : then lay that heap in the middle between theother two. This done lay them out again in three heaps asbefore, and again request him to notice where his noted cardgoes, and put that heap in the middle, as before. Then tak¬ing up the cards with their backs toward you, take off the up¬permost card, and reckon it one; take off another, whichreckon two; and thus proceed till you come to the eleventh,which will invariably prove to be the card thought of. Youmust never lay out your cards less than three times, but asoften above that number as you please. This trick may bedone without your seeing the cards at all, if you handle andcount them carefully. To diversify the trick, you may use adifferent number of cards, hut the number chosen must bedivisible by three, and the middle card, after they have beenthrice dealt as directed, will always be the one thought of;for instance, if done with fifteen cards, it must be the eighth,and so on; when the number is even, it must be the exacthalf; as, if it be twenty-four, the card thought of will be thetwelfth, &c.TO PICK OUT ALL THE COURT CARDS BLINDFOLD.The following trick is one of the simplest when known, butcreates more wonder in a private party during its operationthan almost any in the whole catalogue.Previous to your wishing to perform this trick, draw asideone of the party, and make him acquainted with the processof it. After mingling again with the company, and introduc¬ing a discourse about various tricks with cards, you may thenprofess to have the power of picking out all the court cardsblindfold.The process is thus:—After your eyes are tightly bound,and the company seem perfectly satisfied that they are so, takeup the pack, and holding up one in view of the whole company,feci it about. Your confederate (whom you contrive to haveseated next to you,) if a court card, must then tread on yourtoe, and you proclaim aloud, “ Ah ! this is a good one 1” youthen hold up another card, (feeling and smelling it all over,)and if it prove a common card, your confederate takes nonotice of it; you then say, “ No, this will not do—this is a badoneand so on, till you have convinced the company of yourcapability.17iro HOLD FOTTR KNAVES OR FOUR KINGS IN YO0R HAND. AND! TO CHANGE THEM SUDDENLY INTO BLANK CARDS, AND THENj INTO FOUR ACES.You must have cards made for the purpose of this feat, half:ards, as they may be properly termed, that is, one half kingsir knaves, and the other half aces. When you lay the acesDne oyer the other, nothing but the kings or knaves will heseen. Then turning the kings or knaves downwards, the fouraces will be seen. You must have two perfect cards, one aking or knave, to cover one of the aces, or else it will be seen;md the other an ace to lay over the kings or knaves. When(Du wish to make them all blank cards, lay the cards a littleower, and by hiding the aces, they will all appear white onboth sides. You may then ask the company which they choose,pxhibit kings, aces, or blanks as required.UPS AND DOWNS.This is one of the most simple ways, but by no means theless excellent, of ascertaining what card a person chooses.When you are playing with the pack, drop out the diamonds,from the ace to the ten, and contrive without being perceived,!to get all the other cards with their heads in the same direc¬tion ; then request a person to choose a card; do not forceone, but let him choose whichever he pleases: while he has itin his hand and is looking at it, carelessly turn the pack inyour hand, so that the position of the cards may be reversed ;then bid him put the card he has chosen into the centre of thepack ; shuffle and cut them, and you may to a certainty knowthe card chosen, by its head being upside down, or in a dif¬ferent direction from the rest of the pack.THE TURN-OVER.When you have found a card chosen, which you have pre¬viously forced, or any card that has been drawn, and whichyou have discovered by the means before described, in orderto finish your trick cleverly, convey the card, privately,to the top of the pack; get all the other cards even witheach other, but let the edge of your top card project a littleover the rest; hold them between your finger and thumb,about two feet from the table, let them drop, and the top card(which must be, as we have said, the one drawn,) will fall witliits face uppermost, and all the rest with their faces toward thetable.CARDS IN COUPLES.Select any twenty cards, and having them shuffled by anyperson that pleases, lay them in pairs upon the table, then desire18several persons (as many as there are pairs on the table) f>look at dift’erent pairs, and remember what cards compose themYou then take up the cards in the order in which they hay«been placed, and replace them with their faces uppermosupon the table, according to the situation of the letters in tinfollowing word:—M U T U SI 2 3 4 5DEBIT6 7 8 9 10N O M E NII 12 13 14 15C O C I s16 17 18 19 20These words, which have no particular meaning, containten letters repeated, or two of each sort. You, therefore, askeach person which row or rows the cards he looked at arein, if he says the first, they must be the second and fourth inthat row; these being the only duplicates in them ; if he says’the second and fourth, they must be the ninth and nineteenth,and so of all the rest. This amusement, which is very simple,and requires very little practice, will excite considerable as¬tonishment in the uninformed.TO CALI, ANY NUMBER Of CARDS FROM A PACK.Take up a pack of cards, and carelessly notice the bottomcard in the pack, then pretend to shuffle them well, but becareful to shuffle that particular card (say the ace of diamonds)always as the top card, then desire any of the party to cut theminto three packs ; when done, call for the ace of diamonds atany of the packs but the one which you know contains it atthe top. Of course it will be quite a different card, (say thenine of clubs;) then call for that at the next, which will bodifferent again, (say the jack of spades;) then call for it at thepack which you know contains the ace of diamonds, and youcan then produce the whole of those called for. Be carefulto throw' them on the table in the order yon called for them,and this will appear a fine trick.THREE DICE BEING THROWN ON A TABLE, TO TELL THR NUM¬BER OE EACH OP THEM, AND THE ORDER IN WHICH THEY'STAND.Let the person who has thrown the dice double the numberof that next to his left hand, and add five to that sum; thenmultiply that amount by five, and to the product add thenumber of the middle dice, then let the whole be multiplied19by ten, and to that product add the number of the third dice.J'rom the total let there be subtracted 250, and the figures ofthe number that remain will answer to the points of the threedice, as they stand on the tableExample.—Suppose the points of the three dice thrown on thetable to be 4, 6, 2.Then the double of the first dice will be  8To which add  5135That sum multiplied by five will be  65To which add the number of the middle dice  671And multiply the sum by  10710To that product add the number of the thirddice  2712Subtract  250462The numbers of the dice and the order inwhich they stand.ANT NUMBER OF MCE BEING GIVEN, TO DETERMINE WIIAT DE¬GREE OF PROBABILITY THERE IS OF THROWING AN ASSIGNEDNUMBER OF POINTS.In the first place we shall suppose that the dice are of theordinary kind, namely, having six faces marked with the num¬bers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6; and we shall analyze some of the first casesof the problem, that we may proceed regularly to those thatare more intricate.I. It is proposed to throw a determinate point, 6 for in¬stance with one die.Here it is evident, that as the die has six faces, one ofwhich is only marked six, and as any one of them may asreadily come up as another, there are five chances againstthe person who wishes to throw a six at one throw, and onlyone in his favour.20II. Let it be proposed to throw the same point 6 with twodice.To analyze this case, we must first observe that two dicegive 36 different combinations, for each of the faces of the dieA, for example, may be combined with each of those of the <die B, which will produce 36 combinations. But 6 may bethrowm first _3, and 3; second by 2, with the die A, and 4with the die B, which, as may be readily seen, forms two dis¬tinct cases; third, by 1 with the die A, and 5 with the die B,or 1 with B and 5 with A, which also gives two cases; andthese are all which are possible. Hence there are five favour¬able chances in 36; consequently, the probability of throwingsix with two dies, is 5-36, and that of not throwing it is 31-36.This therefore ought to be the ratio of the stakes or moneydeposited by the players. But analyzing the other cases, itwill be found that of throwing two with two dice, there is onechance in 36; of throwing 3, there are two; of throwing 4,three; of throwing 5, four; of throwing 6, 5; of throwing 7,six; of throwing 8, five; of throwing 9, four; of throwing 12,three. If three dice were proposed, with which it is evidentthe lowest point would be three, and the highest eighteen, itwill be found, by a similar analysis, that in 216, ttie wholenumber of the throws possible with three dice, there is onechance of throwing 3; three of throwing 4; six of throwing5, &c.FIRE WORKS.TO MAKE ARTIFICIAL FIRE BALLS.Put thirty grains of phosphorus into a Florence flask, withthree or four ounces of water. Place the vessel over a lamp,and give it a boiling heat. Balls of fire will soon be seen toissue from the water, after the manner of an artificial fire-work,attended with the most beautiful coruscations.TO MAKE FIRE FLASH FROM WATER.Pour a small quantity of clear water into a glass, and put apiece or two of phosphoret of lime into it. In a few secondsflashes of fire will dart from the surface of the water, and endin curls of smoke rising in regular succession.TO MAKE LUMINOUS WRITING IN THE DARK.Fix a small piece of solid phosphorus in a quill, and write withit upon paper; if the paper be then placed in a dark room, thewriting will appear beautifully luminous.21THE FIERY FOUNTAIN.If twenty grains of phosphorus, cut very small, and mixedwith forty grains of powder of zinc, be put into four drachmsof water, and two drachms of concentrated sulphuric acid beadded thereto, bubbles of inflamed phosphoretted hydrogengas will quickly cover the whole surface of the fluid in succes¬sion, forming a real fountain of fire.TO CAUSE A BRILLIANT EXPLOSION UNDER WATER.Drop apiece of phosphorus, the size of a pea, into a tumblerof hot water; and, from a bladder, furnished with a stop-cock,force a stream of oxygen directly upon it. This will afford amost brilliant combustion under water.TO MAKE A PARTY' APPEAR GHASTLY.Take half a pint of spirits, and haring warmed it, put ahandful of salt with it into a basin, then set it on fire, and itwill have the effect of making every person within its in¬fluence look hideous. This feat can only be performed in aroom.TO CAUSE A REPORT LIKE A GUN WITH A PIPE.Previously to performing this feat, you must have a powdercomposed of the following ingredients in your pocket:—Oneounce of saltpetre, one ounce of cream of tartar, and half anounce of sulphur, pulverized singly, and then mixed together.Convey a single grain of this powder into a tobacco-pipe, andwhen it takes fire, it will produce a noise like that of a gun,without breaking the pipe.TO MAKE DETONATING BALLS, &C.Half a grain of fulminating silver is to be wrapped up witha hard pea, in a piece of tissue paper, this, when thrownsmartly on the ground, or when trod npon, explodes with aloud report.A very small quantity of the silver, enclosed in a piece ofsandpaper, and placed under the foot of a chair, will explodewhen any one sits down on it. A little of it placed in the heelof a boot or shoe, with a piece of paper pasted over it, willexplode on the heel being pressed to the ground. Placed in asnuffers, it will go off with a smart report when they receivethe hot snuff of the candle.TO MAKE CRACKERS.Some stout cartridge paper must be cut into pieces threeinches and a-half broad, and one foot long ; one edge of each22of these pieces fold down lengthwise, rather less than an inch1broad ; fold the double edge down a quarter of an inch, andturn the single edge back half over the double fold; then openit, and lay all along the channel which is formed by the foldingsof the paper, some meal powder; then fold it over and over,till all the paper is doubled up, rubbing it down every turn;this done, bend it backwards and forwards, two inches and a-half or thereabouts at a time, as often as the paper will allow,then hold all these folds flat and close, and with a smallpinching cord give one turn round the middle of the cracker,and pinch it close, then bind it with pack thread as tight asyou can, then, in the place where it was pinched, prime oneend, and cap it with touch paper. When these crackers arefired they will give a report at every turn of the paper.TO MAKE WATERLOO CRACKERS.Take a slip of cartridge paper, about three quarters of an iinch in width, paste and double it, let it remain till dry, thencut it in two equal parts in length, (Nos. 1 and 2,) according ,to the following pattern :—| No. 1. Glass | S | Glass | No. 2. [ ‘Take some of the glass composition and lay it across the 'paper as in the pattern, put about a quarter of a grain offulminating silver in that part marked S, and while the glasscomposition is moist, put the paper marked No. 2 over thefurthest row of glass. Over all paste twice over the part thatcovers the silver, a piece of paper, let it dry, and when youwish to explode it, take hold of the two ends and pull themquickly from each other, when a loud report will be produced.TO MAKE SQUIBS AND SERPENTS.First make the cases, of about six inches in length, by roll¬ing slips of stout cartridge paper three times round a roller,and pasting the last fold, tying it near the bottom as tight aspossible, and making it air tight at the end by sealing wax.Then take of gunpowder half a pound, one ounce of charcoal,one ounce of brimstone, and half an ounce of steel filings;grind them with a muller or pound them in a mortar. Thecases being dry and ready, first put in a thimbleful of powder,and ram it hard down with a ruler, then fill the case to thetop with the aforesaid mixture, ramming it hard down in thecourse of filling it two or three times; when this is done,point it with touchpaper, which should be pasted on that partwhich touches the case, otherwise it will be liable to drop oft.23TO MAKE SKY ROCKETS.As the performance of rockets depend much upon theirmoulds, they should be made according to the following pro¬portions :—Taking the diameter of the orifice, its heightshould be equal to six diameters and two-thirds ; the choke,one diameter and one third of this model, will serve for everyrocket from four oz. to six lbs.; for instance, suppose thediameter of a rocket of one pound be one and a-half inch,then its length being six diameters and two thirds, the lengthof the case must be ten inches one-eighth, and the choke twoand a quarter inches. Your rammer must have a collar ofbrass to prevent the wood from splitting.The principal part of the performance of the rocket dependson the compositions being well mixed; therefore great caremust be taken in this part of the work, particularly in themanufacture of rockets.Rockets are filled hollow, otherwise they would not ascend.The charge of rockets must always be driven above thepiercer, and on it must be rammed a thin head of clay,through the middle of which bore a small hole to the com¬position, that when the charge is burned to the top, it maycommunicate its fire through the hole to the stars in the head.When you load the heads of your rockets with stars or serpentsor any thing else, remember always to put a ladiefull ofpowder into each head.TO MAKE RED FIRE.The beautiful red fire which is used in the theatres is com¬posed of the following ingredients:—Forty parts of dry nitrateof strontian, thirteen parts of finely powdered sulphur, fiveparts of chlorate of potash, and four parts of sulphuret ofantimony.TO MAKE GREEN FIRE.Take of flour of sulphur thirteen parts, of nitrate of baryta,seventy-seven, of oxymuriate of potassa, five, of metallicarsenic, two, of charcoal three. The nitrate of baryta shouldbe well dried and powdered.TO MAKE A BLUE CANDLE.These cases are made much the same as for serpents, andare filled with a composition of a quarter of an ounce of salt¬petre, half an ounce of powder, and one ounce of sulphur.A very small quantity of charcoal may be added, whichwill have a sparkling effect.24TO MAKE AN AI1TIFICAL VOLCANO.Tor this curious experiment, which enables us to assign avery probable cause for volcanoes, we are indebted to Lemery.Mix equal parts of pounded sulphur and iron filings, and hav¬ing formed the whole into a paste with water, bury a certainquantity of it, forty or fifty pounds for example, at the depthof about a foot below the surface of the earth. In ten ortwelve hours after, the earth will swell up and burst, andflames will issue out, which will enlarge the aperture, scatter¬ing around a yellow and blackish dust. It is not impossible thatwhat is here seen in miniature, takes place on a grand scalein volcanoes: as it is well known that they always furnishabundance of sulphur, and that the matters they throw upabound in metallic, and probably ferruginous particles; foriron is the only metal which has the property of producing aneffervescence with sulphur, when they are mixed together.But it may easily be conceived, from the effect of a smallquantity of the above mixture, what thousands of millions ofpounds of it would produce; there is no doubt that the resultwould be phenomena as terrible as those of earthquakes andof volcanic eruptions, with which they are generally accom¬panied.HOW TO EAT FIRE, AND TO BLOW IT UP IN YOUR MOUTH.Anoint your tongue with liquid storax, and you may put apair of tongs into your mouth red hot, without hurting your¬self, and lick them till they are cold, by the help of this oint¬ment ; and by preparing your mouth thus, you may take wood-coal out of the fire, and eat it like bread; dip it then intobrimstone powder, and the fire will seem more strange, butthe sulphur puts out the coal. You may put a piece of burn¬ing charcoal into your mouth, and suffer a pair of bellows tobe blowing it continually, and receive no hurt, but your mouthmust be quickly cleaned, otherwise it will cause a salivation:it is a very dangerous thing to be done, and although thosethat practise it, use all the means they can to prevent danger,yet it is seldom these fire-eaters have a good complexion.

and to the fair,My secret wounds impart,Tell all I hope, tell all I fear,Each motion in my heart.But she methinks is list’ning now,To some enchanting strain,The smile that triumphs o’er her brow,*Seems not to heed my pain.Yes, plaintive sounds, yet, yet delayHnwe’er my love repine,Let that gay minute pass away,The next perhaps is thine.Yes, plaintive sounds, no longer crost,Your griefs shall soon be o’er,Her cheek undimplad now has lost,The smile it lately wore.Yes, plaintive sounds, she now is yours,’Tis now your time to move $Essay to soften all her pow’ts,And be that softness, love.Cease, plaintive sounds, your task is doneThat anxious tender airProves o’er her heart the conquest won,I see you melting,there.iReturn, ye smiles, return again,Return each sprightly grace,I yield up to your charming reign.All th?,t enchanting face.I take no outward shew amiss.Rove where they will, her eyes,Still let her smi.es each shepherd1'bless,So she but hear my sighs.THE LASS O’ 13ALLOCHMYLE.Twas even—the dewy fields were green,On every blade the pearls haug,Thg Zephyr wanton’d round the bean,And here its fragrant sweets alang.In every glen the mavis sang,All nature listening seem’d the while,Except where greenwood echoes rang,Araang the braes o’ Ballocbmyle.With careless steps I onward^stray'd,My heart rejoiced in nature’s joy,W- lien musing in a lonely shad#,A maiden fair I chanced to spy :Her look was like the morning’s aye,Her hair like nature’s vernal smile,Perfection whispered passing by,Behold the lass o’ Ballochmyle.Fair is the morn in flowery May,And sweet is night in autumn mild,8When roving through the garden gay,Go wandering in the lonely wild jBut woman, nature’s darling child,There all her charms she does compile,Even there her .other works are foil’d,By the lass o’ Ballochmyle.O, had she been a country maid,And I the happy country swain,Though shelter’d in the- lowest shed,That ever rose on Scotland’s plain.Through weary winter’s wind and rain,With jay with rapture I would toil,And nightly to my bosom strain jThe bonny lass o‘ Ballochmyie.Then pride might climb the slippery steep,Where fame and honours lofty shine,And thirst of gold might tempt the deep,Or downward sink, the Indian mine jGive me the' cot below the pine,To tend the flocks or til! the soil,And every day have joys divine,With the bonny lass o’ Ballochmyle.FINIS.

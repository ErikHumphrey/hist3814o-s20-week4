Being at that time in Cork, and not meet¬ing there with a veiTel to my fatisfaftion, l tookan adventrous paflage to Briftol, in a coaftingbrig, ar>d arrived fate at the defired place on the4th of July 1769 I now (hipped myi’elf onboardthe Jane of Briltol, Captain Clarke, for the Havetrade- on the Coaft of Guinea We foon reach¬ed the defired coaft and there took m 500 (laveswhith whom we proceeded to Jamaica, where,we arrived in December following.Here I left her, and entered on board a (loop,commanded by Creole, named Peter Richardionto go to Ratan for curtles We accordingly fail¬ed from Montego-bay in January 1770 , and infive days arrived at the place of our deftination jwhere in the fpace of a month we caught aboveninety turtles ; after which we failed again forJamaica But after being a few days at Sea,having little wind, and a very fttong current,we were driven through the guiph of Florida,and obliged to caft anchor in the river Mississipi.Here we remained about five days; we then (foodout to fea again, and in twelve days arrived fafein Montego-bay, After this I (ailed to the bayof Honduras, tor logwood and mahogany, in thebrigantine Nancy, Captain Ferguson — Ve, com*pleated this voyage, and arrived again in Jamaicaiu March 1770.I5 *I was/ than engaged by Captain Woodkoufe,'of the {loop Betfey, to go with him (as he theninformed me) to the bay of Honduras. On the26th of March wc failed from Jamaica, fully per*fuaded that the bay of Honduras was our deftin-ed place; but were foon informed of our Captain’sintention of going to the Ifthraus of Darien, formules and hornea cattle Accordingly on or a-bout the icth of April, vc anchored a little onto the weflward of Nombre de Dios, and ourCaptain difpatched a negro on fhore, who couldfpeak the Spanifh tongue, as a mefllngsr toinform the inhabitants that he wanted a fewmules and horned cattle, for which he would re¬turn them fundry goods, which he had brrught:for that purpofe, ViZ. linens, hardware, and cut¬lery wareAs fcon as the inhabitants received this intelli¬gence, they brought to the fhore about thirtymoles, and forty b«ad cf homed cattle, whichwe took on board; and the Spaniards came 011board to receive in exchange fuch goods as theymade choiee of: But before any of their articles, were landed, our Captain ordered us to fetze theSpaniards by force of arms, and put them onfhore j which we accordingly did, and immedi¬ately weighed anchor, leaving thefe poor injuredpeople to bewail their Id's and difappointment,and curie the Engliih traders for this perfidiousinjury done them.

 — 4With yftui’ passions all Inflamed and your reason laid aside,l.ou may take some stranger by the hand and fancy her yourbride.Or when Bacchus leads the way, will you think amid the noiseThat the pleasure you are seeking all my happiness destroys ;1 or your frolic and your wit, perhaps, their leader you maybe—To me such honour is disgrace—such laughter, misery:But had I a voice of thunder to shake St. Stephen’s dome,I d have no brandy from abroad, no whisky made at home;Or if Statesmen license Publicans to vend the “mountaindew,”Let the men who make the paupers be compelled to keepthem too!“LIBERTY, EQUALITY AND FRATERNITY!”Tune—“iJo5 Sorison’s Bannet."Commotion, commotion is seen far and near,The surges are thund'ring—hearts failing for fear;The sceptres are trembling—crowns nod to their fall,And monarchy staggers at anarchy’s call.The Pope, that has war against Freedom long waged.Is now like a bird in the Vatican caged,Tho’ late as the great Liberator revered—But he’s a wise warlock that kens his ain weird.As Britons, we Liberty’s blessings would crave,Tho’ none knows in what he is held as a slave—Yes; free to he lazy and get up a strike,Then live on our neighbour and do what we like!Equality, too, is the sum of our song,But righted to-day, ere to-morrow were wrong;For one drops his cash in the Savings’ Bank’s till,While another melts his in the Publican’s gill.Fraternity, too, we are leagued to adranee,With thoae who our artizans kick out of France,Such brotherly love, sure, the Irishman tried,Who placed reciprocity all on one side.The men who their country’s fair character blot,And basely degrade the proud name of a Scot,The red rampant Lion would tear from our flag,And over them flutter the tricolour rag.But shame to the man that would cover his eyes,Is or blessings of Plenty and Liberty prize;o'1 grateful acknowledge the Peace we enjoy,Nor his head nor his hand to defend them employ.THE PIPES.TUNE—11 Maggie Lauder!*Tne blast o’ war, on Braes o’ Mar,Arous d rebellion's stour, man ;The bagpipes clear, the clans did cheer,To fecht at Sherra-moor, man :Then foreign field saw sword an' shield,Baith Dons an’ Munsies claw, man :The pibroch gay, that cleared the way,Was Up and waur them a\ man.But bowden bags, an’ drones wi’ flagsGaed out as Peace cam’ in, man ;An' saurless gypes preserv’d the pipes,That only gya the win’, man;A hg!,: they scratch, and hand the match’A here they tobacco stuff in ;Then raise a smoke wad smore a brock,While all they scour puff-puffin’!eHer* beggars blind, to raise the wind,Their black-mou’d cutty blaw, man;For what you chuck, they wus you luck,But never miss a draw, man;There royal Stars, wi’ dear cigars,In clouds consume their days, man;When Dukes hae luck to kill a buck,They sit astride an’ blaze, man!Thus gryte an’ sma’, in cot an’ ha’,Inhale this foreign fume, man;An’ sons o' toil in smoking pile,Baith bit an’ brat consume, man 5Their wives gang bare, their bairns want lare,An’ reek aye maks a sour house;When limb and lith hae tint their pith,They shochel to the Poorhouse.Then, Lasses gay, attend my lay,That’s lilted for your profit;An’ quickly quench this poison’s stenchThat’s only fit for Tophet ;Renounce the race, that fumes your face,Tho’ some may ca’ you saucy;—Nane but a gype, for fousome pipe,Would lose a thrifty lassie!THE PIPE AND BOWL.Tune—“ IV//a tvadna fechtfor Charlie f "Fill the Bowl and foam the Bicker,While Mackenzie’s eyelids wink ;Drink makes languid hearts beat quicker,Empty heads sublimely think.Drink, all slavish toil forgetting,Drink can make the clown a king;Drink till eyes in joy are setting,Drink makes sorrow take the wing J7Parson* preach that drink’s demerit*Bring us all to Tophet’s brink;While their Elders deal in spirits,And their Deacons draw our clink.Templars, decked in Popish tucker,Spread their chaff to gull our class;Templars, leagued the weak to succour,Give the sign but grip the glass!Bring the pipe with lengthy stalk in,Well Tobacco Bacchus serves;Smoke promotes enligtened talkin’,Wings the fancy—soothes the nerves.Smoke, nor name our lair for sleeping,Fireless hearth and sloppy floor;Smoke till vapours round us creepingScreen from peepers at the door.Statesmen, like the press of Bramah,Tax from Pipe and Bicker squeeze;Drinking paid the Alabama,Smoking smored the Ashantees ;Near Balmoral’s banner’d turrets,Lochnagar* recruits the cag ;And the smoke of “ royal ” spiritsStains the folds of Britain’s flag.While the Pipe and Bicker cheer usWondrous scenes enchant our view ;Kobed in clouds, like Fingal’s heroes,Swift we mount—Police, adieu!Drinking, smoking, grandly soaring,Till the floor arrests their head,Leave we safe our heroes snoringWhere Incapables are spread.♦ A Distillery so called,8WELCOME TO THE FESTIVAL.Tune—“ Scots who. hae."Friends, arrared at Temp’rance’ call,Foes to Drink’s degrading thrall,Welcome to our Festival—To all a gueed New Year.Wha wad kirk or court reform?Wha wad lay the social storm ?Let liim crush the fiery wormThat stung the parted Year.Stillers proud and Brewers bland,Linked wi’ Tapsters’ balefu’ band,Tour distruction o'er the land.And blight the budding Year.Tempters prowl in ilka place,Luring youth to dire disgrace;Bon-Accord, these blots efface,And launch a purer Year.What though Plenty crowned the plain,When the lore o’ sordid gainPoison strained from tortured grain,And spoiled the plenteous Year?Drunkards, daised in filthy lair,Drunkards’ wives, forfowden sair,Drunkards’ bairns, mislea: d and b re,Ne’er blessed the bounteous Year.Youth, as Vet’rans fade away,Round our flag your strength array jTriumph soon will hail the day,That heralds Freedom’s Year.Patriots, liquor’s tide restrain,Freemen, break the drunkard’s chain,Light of Truth, on land an’ main,Ob, beam a brighter Year.

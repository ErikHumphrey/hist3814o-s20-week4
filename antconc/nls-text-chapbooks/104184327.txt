I will put my law in their ,inward parts, and write it in their hearts, and Iwill be their God, and they (hall be my people. \And in Pf. Ixxxix. throught. It is called a co¬venant of grace ; becaufe grace is the begm-ing and the end, the foundation and top-lloneof it; even grace reigning thro’ righteoufnels. It |s called a covenant of mercy ; becaufetherein mercy to the miferable is proclaimedthro’ juftice fatisfying blood ; for there mercyand truth met together; and all the fare mer¬cies of David arc conveyed thereby. It is cal¬led a covenant of peace and reconciliation ; be-caufe it both treats of peace with God and makesit good. It is called a covenant of prom.fe; be- -caufe it lies in promifes with reference to us;and thefe to be accomplilhed upon the conditi¬on already fulfilled in Chrift’s obedience and fa-tisfatfion ; and becaufe therein the faithfulnefsof God is pledged, for making out all the pr -mifes to believers, and the children of promife.It is called a covenant of fait; became it is an ;incorruptible word, an everlafting covenant wellordered in all things and fore. In a word U iscovenant of heln to poor, helplefs finners. f y- ;inS I have laid help upon one that is mighty OJftael, thou had de/boyed thyfelf, but in me isthy help.

It is a covenant of fupply 10the needy, fa\ing, When the poor and needyfetk water, and there is none, and their tonguefailcth for third, I, the Lord, will hear them. Ithe God of Ijrael, will not forfake them. It isa covenant of gifts, wherein grace and glory arefrt-ely given; and, in the difpenfation thereofGod fa>s come, and take all freely, bimfelf, hisChrifl, his Spirit, and all. Rev. xxii. 17.Ifa. lv. 1.II. We are to (hew what it is for God to haverefpetfl to the covenant.I G >d hath refpect to the covenant when heremembers it, and fo remembers us, as in thatforfeited. Lev. xxvi 47. I will remember my co¬venant, and then will I remember the land.Thus IT cxi. 5. He hath given meat to themthat fear him. Why, he will ever be mindfulof his covenant, if he come to give us meat, tofeed ouv fouls at this occafion, the ground willbe, he will be mindful of his covenant, mind-'ful of his promife.2. God may be faid to have refpeifi to his co.venant, when he regards it. He hath no reafonto have*refpe<5t or regard to us, but he fees rea.fon to have regard to his covenant; he puts ho¬nour upon it, for reafons that I (hall afterwards(hew. only I will fay here, his honour is engagedtherein, therefore he fays. My covenant will Inot break, nor alter the thing that is gone out ofmy lips, Pfal. Ixxxix. 34. He hath more regardto6 Filth's Plea upon God's Covenant.to it than he hath to heaven and earth, for hefays, heaven and earth JhiU pafs away, but my"words [hill not pafs away. He hath fuch regirdto it, that he will never break it, but everkeep it.3. He hath refpecft to his covenant, when heeflablidies it. And when we pray, that hewould have lefpecTt to the covenant, we not on¬ly pray he would remember the covenant, andregard the covenant, but en.ablifh the covenantbetwixt him and us, as he faid to Abraham,Gen xv»i. 7. / will eftablifi) it between me andthee, and thy feed after thee. He fhews refpetffcto the covenant, when be makes the covenanttake hold of us, and makes us take hold of thecovenant ; for then he makes us put refpetH: up¬on him, and upon his covenant.4. He hath refpecl to the covenant, when heperforms the covenant promife, according toMicah -vii 20. 'Thou wilt perform the truth to"Jacob, and the mercy to Abraham which tb*uhall Jworn to our fathers from the dayPof old ;and he does this, when he a<fls according to thecovenant, or according to the mercy that madethe promife, and the truth that is engaged tomake out the promife.In fhort, the fum of this prayer, as it concernsthe import of the word refpetfl, have refpeci tothe covenant, is, Lord remember the covenant,and fo remember me ; Lord, have regard to thecovenant, and let me be retnembred on thisground when there is no reafon why I fhouldbe regarded; Lord, eftabliflt the covenant withFaith's Plea upon God's Covenant. jwe, and (1) pm honour upon thy name manifefl-ed in that covenant, and to me according to thepromife of the covenant, caufe me hope in thyword, and then remember thy word o.i whichthou haft caufed me to hope ; and deal with menot according to my fin and defert, but accord¬ing to thy covenant and mercy in Chrift Jefus.HI. We are next to (hew what it is in thecovenant he hath a refpetft to, or that we (houldplead upon.i. Have refpeft to the covenant; that is, tothe Mediator of the covenant. Though thouowtft no refpttft to me, yet dolt thou not owerefpcct, and haft thou not a great rtfpttft to theMediator of the covenant, even to him whomti on haft given to be a covenant of the people?F >r his fake let me be^pitied ; have a refpetft tothe relation he bears to the covenant, even tohim who is the Mediator.

It is a ftrong plea to pleadwith God upon the refpect he bears to Chrift •God cannot win over fuch a plea as that. Hemnfl own his regard and refped: to Chrift whopaid fuch refpect to him, and finilhed the workhe gave him to do.? JJave i-efpetf to the covenant, by havinerelpeft to the blood of the covenant.

Have refpetft to the covenant, by havingref'petft to the oath of the covenant Heb. vi 17.The promife is confirmed with the oath of God7hat by two immutable things ’wherein it is im.poffihle for God to lie, we might have ftrong con.folation, &c. Now, Lord wilt thou not haverefpeft to thine own oath? Haft thou not pwornby thy holinefs, thou wilt not lie unto David?4. Have refpetft to the covenant, by havinga refpetfl to the properties of the covenantsThis would be a large fi' ld ; I fum it up in afew words. Have refptd to the covenant ; thatis, Lord, have refpetft to the fulnefs of the co¬venant, and let me be fupplted, for there is e-nough there ; it contains all my falvation, andall my defire. Have refpetft to the freedom ofthe covenant, and let me, however unworthy,(hare of the grace that runs freely thence.Have refpetft to the (lability of the covenant,and let me be pitied, though unftable as wa¬ter, and infirm, yet the covenant (lands fall ;remember thy word that endures for ever.Have refpetft to the order of the covenant, thatis well ordered in all things, as well as fore.ThoughFaith's Plea upon GotPs Covenant. 97hough my houfe be not fo with God, fays Da¬vid, yet he hath made with me an everlafling co~l venant, well ordered in all things and fure.| Though my houfe be out of order, and heartout of order, and my frame out of order, andall be in confufion with me, yet fee, accordingto thy covenant, to order all well.IV. We proceed to fliew what kind of a re-fpe«fl he hath to the covenant, that we may bej the more engaged to plead upon it.1. He hath a great and high refpe<ft to the1 covenant. It is the covenant of the great God,1 with his great and eternal Sou, for the honouri and glory of his great name ; and theref ire, he1 cannot but have a great and high refperff untoi it. His great name is manif<-lted in it; and( therefore, when we plead his refpetft to the co*venant, we plead in effetfl, faying, What wiltthou do for thy great name?2. He hath a dear and lovely refpetff to thecovenant; for, it is the covenant of bis graceand love, wherein he Ihews his infinite Io\e toChrifi, and through him to a company ofwretched finners It is a covenant of kindnefs,Ifa. liv. 10. My kindnefs (hall not depart fromthee, neither (hall the covenant of tny peace< be removed, faith the Lord, that hath mercy on1 thee ; intimating, his covenant of peace is a co.venant of kindnefs, wherein he manifefts his1 dearelt love; therefore he hath a dear refpe&to it.3. He hath a full refpetfl to the covenant, aB refpedtio Faith's Plea upon God's Covenant.refpeft to every promife of it; they are all yeaand atner^ to the glory of God, 2 Cor. i. 20.He hath a relpecft to all ot them, becaufe they •are all yea and amen, and becaufe they are adthus ratified in Chrift, to the glory of God,He hath refpeift to every article of the cove-hant, not a jot lliall fall to the ground.4. He hath an everlafling refpedt to the co¬venant ; therefore it is called, an everl.illiugcovenant; it is fecured by an everlalting righte-oufnefs; it is made between everlafling parties;it is repleniflied with everlafling bleflings; it isrooted in his everlafling love ; therefore he isever mindful of his covenant, and will neverceafe to have refpecl to it.Well then, fay you, what need we pray andplead, that he would have refpetfl to his cove¬nant? Why, if it be Cure that he hath, andwill for ever have a refpe^l to the covenant,then we may pray with the more affurauce andconfidence ; fo that there is here flrong footingfor anr prayers But befides, when we pray, andfay. Have refpett unto the covenant, we feck,that he would Ihew the refpetfl: that he hathunto it, that he would fhew and make it mani-fefl unto us, that we may have the faith of ir,and enjoy the fruits of it, and the blefled effedtsof that refpect to it, in our participation of thebleflings thereof.V. The next thing was, to fhew,why he willhave refpedt to his covenant; and conlt-quently,whence it is fuch a faitable plea and argumentfor us. Why,». WhenFaith's Plea upon God’s Covenant. 11i.

My God Jhall fupply all your need, accor-j ding to his riches in glory, by Chrijl Jefus.VI, I would now proceed to make fome ap¬plication of the fubjetft in thefe four words.I. Hence fee a mark and character of truebelievers, that are fit for a communion table,they are of God’s mind ; he hath a relpe^t tothe covenant, and they have a refpetfl to thecovenant; and hence they know what it is toplead with God upon the refpeCt that he bathto the covenant; they could not do fo, if theyhad not a high refpedi to it themlelves; theyhave fuch a refpetft to the covenant in kind asGod hath. They have a great refpeft to it,fo as they efieem it more than all things in aworld; they would not give one promile of it,on which they have been caufed to hope, forall the gold of Opbir. They have a dear andkindly refpetft to it, as all their falvation andall their defire : Yea, and all their delight al-fo. The word of grace is fweeter to them thanhoney and the honey-comb. They have a foiland univerfal relpect to it, and to all the pro-tnifes of it ; they refpeiff the protnife of purityas well as the promife of pardon ; the promifeT,,Ill's Pica upon God’s Covenant. irof filvation from fin, as well, and as iruich,the promife of fd vat ion from hell; the promifeof holinef# a- svell as of happinefs. As theyhave a refiju<ff to all God’s commandments, l'«they have a refpetfl to all his promifes; andparticnlarly as David had his golden Pfalms,fit they have their, golden promifes that theyare made hing upon Yea, they hive an ever-lafling refped to the covenant and to the pro-mifes thereof; even when their f ame failsthem; when their fweet enjoyments fail them,yet their refpedi to the covenant remains, andtheir r-efpeft to the Maker of the covenant, tothe Mediator of life covenant, to the bloodand oath of the covenant, to the Spirit of thecovenant, and to the bleflings and benefits ofit They have an everlalting refp; to thegrace of tiie covenant of g'ace; they are ador¬ers and admirers of free grace. They have aneverlafling refpect to, and remembrance of thewords of the covenant, particularly thefe wordsthat have b-en let in with any life and powerupon their foul, or that they have been caufedto hope upon ; whatever they forget, they cannever forget fuch a word that biought life totheir fools; / will never forget thy word, firysDavid, for by them thou hu ' quickened me.They have fueli an everlafling refpeft to thecovenant, that when they have nothing in theworld to truft to; they will rely ou the cove¬nant, and confide in fnch a proniife, and pleadupon it, faying, Lord, have refpefi to the cove¬nant.2. Hence we may fee the tnifery of thefethat are unbelievers, and remain ftrangers totbev c /■- -—i. ■            3 6 Faith’s Plea upon God’s Covenant.ihe covenant of promife, and have no refpectto the covenant. It is mifery enough, thatGod hath no refpecl to you; no refpe^l to yourperfon nor prayers, as it is faid, To Cain and hisofferings God had no refpett, Gen. iv. 5. So Godbath no refpetil either to your perfons or per¬formances ; they are an abomination to him.Your prayers to him are but like the howlingof a dog, if you have never taken hold of hiscovenant, nor feen the refpeft that God hathto the covenant. You have no refpedl to God,while you have no refpetfl to that which he re-fpe<i\s fo highly. And as he hath no refpetflto your perfons or performances, he hath norefpedi: to your tears; they never flowed fromfaith’s views of a pierced Ghrift. He ha^h norefpeft to your fouls, the redemption thereofceafeth for ever, becaufe you have no due re-fpetft to the Redeemer’s blood and righteouf-nefs. He hath no refpetff to your comnauni-cating; nay, he difipproves of it, and di£charges you to fit down at his table, on perilof eating and drinking your damnation. Godbath 110 regard nor refpetfl to your falvaiion,becaufe you have no regard nor refpetfl to theSaviour he hath provided and offered. Godthinks as little tu damn you, as you think littleto diflionour him. God thinks as little of you,as you think little of fin, and he hath as littlerefpetfl to you, as you have to Cbrift and tothe covenant. Wo to you, if you remain inthis cafe ; for the day is coming wherein Godwill before all the world, fhew no more re-fpe«5t to yon, than to fay to you, Depart fromme, ye cuffed into ever la fling fire, preparedfor ihe devil and his angelsl. But,3. Hence.faith's Pica upon God's Covenant. ijr3. Hence we may fee the happinefs of belie.! vers, that have fuch a refpeft to the covenant,as t was fpeaking of, a great, dear, full, and per¬petual refpetft to it, and the Mediator of it, whohave taken hold of the covenant thro’grace, andI know what it is to take hold of God in the co-I venant, to take hold of God in a promife, and to: hold him by his word, and rely upon him in itfaying. Lord, have refpetft to the covenant; hereis your great happinefs, God hath a iefpe<5t toyou: What refpetfl ? Even to your perfons andofferings, as it is faid of Abel, Gen. iv. 4. Godj .had a rc/peil to him and to his offerings. Thoughyou be faying in your heart, Oh ! how can hehave a refpecf to me, black and vile, and guil¬ty me? why? not for your fake indeed, be itknown unto you, but for his covenant’s fake, andhis name’s fake. He hath a refpect to your pray-j ing, and praifing, and communicating; becaufehe hath a refpedt to the covenant. He hath a: refpetff to your name; though the name of theJ wicked (Ttal! rot, your name fhall be in everlaff-i ing remembrance ; for God hath put his name inI y°u; fomething of Chrift in you, fomething of| the covenant in you.

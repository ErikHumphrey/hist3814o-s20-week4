In vain Se¬bastian, the Sovereign of this country, opposedthe bravery, fidelity, and the utmost resources ofhis kingdom, to this ravening horde, stimulatedalike by rapine and the glory of warlike exploits.Many, however, through succeeding years, werethe conflicts which its brave inhabitants sustained,headed by a sovereign, whom they loved equallyfor his justice, humanity, and courage, againsttheir veteran opponents, flushed with so many vic-Atones: a pitched battle (in which Sebastian anilbis son Alphonso, heading the remaining strengthof his dominions, were completely vanquished,and Sebastian himself being; taken prisoner, whilehe and his intrepid son were performing the mostheroic deeds,) decided at once the fate of thatmonarch, and the whole country. Alphonso, afterachieving whatever the height of consummate skillor desperate valour could effect, to retrieve thefortune of the day, was forced to fly with a fewof his brave adherents, and take refuge inthe most lonely and almost impenetrable recesseswhich the surrounding forests afforded, under thecruel mortification of leaving his unfortunate fa¬ther in the hands of the triumphant Murad.Sebastian, according to the custom of that bar¬barous age, was loaded with chains, and hurriedinto the deep and gloomy dungeons of his ownpalace, which, with all its treasures, the highly-exulting Murad took possession of, and made hisresidence.Among the numerous captives, who had eminent¬ly distinguished themselves upon that fatal daywhich placed Murad on the throne of Mursia,was Alvar, a youth endowed with every personalattraction, heightened by a courage which spurredhim on to the most heroic deeds, and which nodanger could allay.On the conclusion of the battle, this youth,though grieving inwardly for the ruin of his coun¬try, disdaining the chains with which he wasloaded, stood undauntedly before the haughtyconqueror. Murad beheld him with fixed atten¬tion ; his youth, the dignified beauty and grace¬fulness which displayed themselves throughout hisface and person, together with his courage, plead-5ed strongly in his favour. Animated by selfishprinciples, with his own hands Murad releasedhim from his chains, and embracing him, hailedhim as the completest warrior of that hard-con¬tested action.Native dignity, and the unsullied principles ofhonour, occasioned a violent contention with gra¬titude in the bosom of Alvar, for this seeming actof generosity, and held him for some time mute;but the recollection of the benefit he might renderhis suffering country, by mitigating, through hisinterest, the haughty ferocity of Murad, over¬powered every other impulse, and he bowed withdignified acknowledgement for the favour grantedhim.The bosom of this youthful warrior was nostranger to the shafts of love ; the beautiful Sera-phina had made the deepest impression there.This lady was possessed of the most captivatingcharms, both of body and mind; she was thedaughter of a Jew, whose name was Olivarez, whohad in his early years quitted Spain for Palestine,prompted by the eager desire of riches, the inor¬dinate thirst for which had nearly hurried himto ruin.His wealth, which was rapidly acquired by usury,failed not to attract the eyes of a greedy piince,in whose dominions he resided, and some irre¬gularities in his bargains gave an opportunity ofgratifying that rapacity, which is the constant at¬tendant upon eastern power: it was merely by hisembracing the Mahometan faith, and giving alarge sum of money, that he preserved the remain¬der of his wealth, and his life.He had purchased a beautiful Christian slave,by whom he had Seraphina; on her he had6spared neither pains nor expense, to render hercomplete in every accomplishment and attraction ;and her assiduity fully answered his fondest hopes.The plague, which raged with the utmost violence,carried off her mother about the time Seraphinahad attained her sixteenth year; and her father,who had ever preserved the tenderest regard forthat captivating female, who was in every respecthighly worthy of his affection, remained inconsol¬able. Soon after her death, he took the first op¬portunity of conveying himself and his daughter toSpain ; having, previous to his landing, laid asidethe turban, and resumed the garb and religion ofthe Jew'. When the Moors conquered Mursia,he again put on the turban, and became one ofthe most zealous of the true believers; but he didnot long survive his settling in Mursia, to whichcity he had removed on its falling into the handsof Murad. On his death, he left his beloveddaughter great wealth, together with the prudentadvice of carefully secreting it, and spreading thereport of his having died poor.But it w'as not possible to conceal the truthfrom the penetrating eyes of Roderigo, a youthfulSpaniard, whose subtility in bargains, and readi¬ness in accounts, rendered him a most useful agentto this Jewr, both with the Spaniards and theMoors. Long had he in secret cherished a tenderflame for the lovely Seraphina; and he was notwithout hopes, that he might one day become thepossessor both of herself and fortune.But her heart was decidedly fixed on Alvar.The latter had been under the necessity of apply¬ing to Olivarez for a loan, to relieve the wants ofnumbers of his distressed countrymen, whom he’’found the seci'et means of aiding, and which the7viches bestowed upon him by Murad quickly en¬abled him to repay, together with the most exor¬bitant interest charged upon it. It was duringthese meetings with the father that Alvar first be¬held Seraphina, and the most ardent love for hersucceeded. The heart of Seraphina received anequallystrongimpression; and their mutual passionwas soon made known to each other, by means ofa favourite and trusty servant of Seraphina, namedJacintka, who procured them frequent private in¬terviews, in which they exchanged their vows.-After the death of Olivarez, their intercoursewas still more closely repeated.It chanced, that one evening while the subtleRoderigo was musing on the surest means of fur¬thering his views on Seraphina, amid a retired andshady part of the garden at the back of her house,he was roused from his reveries by the rustling ofthe leases at no great distance from him. Start¬ing, he wrapped his cloak closer round him, andconcealing his face, he paced with cautious stepsto the spot from whence the sound came. Heapproached near enough to hear the sound of voices,though in a low tpne, and quickly after saw Ja-cintha conducting a man with great caution to¬wards a private door which led into the fields.The moon, which had just before emerged frontthe clouds, now shone sufficiently bright for himto see the face of Alvar, which he well remem¬bered, from having often seen him with his latemaster. Transported with fury, he revolved athousand projects in his mind, to prevent Alvar’sunion with Seraphina, which he doubted not wason the point of taking place; but the situation ofAlvar, and the high estimation in which he stoodwith Murad, occasioned him the utmost perplexity,and lie could resolve upon nothing, but determined8to seize the first Opportunity, of either blasting hishopes, or effecting his destruction.Although Murad remained in possession of thekingdom of Mursia, and no extensive oppositionto his power was displayed, yet Alphonso was sur¬rounded by an army, which, though at first small,was daily increasing, by the number of Spaniardswho found the means of secretly resorting to him.This prince was possessed of a strong and pe¬netrating judgment, which was capable of improv¬ing every fortunate event to the utmost, and ofmitigating or repairing the most disastrous : inbattle he was cool and intrepid ; deeply versed inall the science and practice of war ; humane andgenerous when a conqueror ; patient, and abound¬ing wdth fortitude, w hen conquered. Such an op¬ponent Murad secretly dreaded, and his apprehen¬sions were the more keen, from the great affec¬tion which the whole kingdom had for him ; andhe wTas firmly satisfied, that his newly-acquiredthrone could never be firmly established, while soable and industrious a rival was in existence ; todeprive him of life, therefore, by whatever meansit could be effected, w'as the prime object of hissoul. . -The hand of Alvar was the only means that couldafford the security he so ardently panted for: seiz¬ing, therefore, a moment, when he judged the sa¬tisfaction and gratitude of Alvar for the favours be¬stowed upon him had clothed his face with joy, hecommenced the trial of his heart, lamenting thenecessity, which his fears imposed upon him, ofthose restrictions and hardships which the Span¬iards endured.Alvar remained in silence, while his soul shud¬dered amid conjectures upon w hat would be theend of this address ; when Murad, eagerly catching9liis hand, said that the future happiness of hiscountrymen depended solely upon his arm. Alvarstarted, and Murad lost no time in trying tosoothe and tempt his awakened soul, by placingbeforejiim the aggrandizement and power whichawaited the executing, at the same time, whatwould yield such happiness to his country, andeven stamp virtue upon the deed : then, hastilyplacing a dagger in his hand, emphatically added,“ That it was the only means of making multitudeshappy, by the sacrifice of one." The horror whichthis excited in the breast of Alvar, .cobbed him ofall reflection, and he instantly dashed the daggeron the earth. The countenance of Murad kindledwith rage and disappointment, in conscious guilthe rolled his glaring eye-balls from the face of Alvar,and fixed them with a downcast look; while hisdeeply agitated bosom prompted the destruction -of this virtuous warrior. Alvar beheld, with re¬turning thought, the convulsive gusts of passionwhich shook the frame of.Murad, and his prudencesought to quell them. Seizing, therefore, the dag¬ger, anil submissively returning it, he thus address¬ed him: “ Mighty conqueror ! let the enemies ofMurad perish in the open field of contention ; andnever may the secret dagger, in the breast of bisadversary, slab bis own glory.” The furious,soulof Murad was abashed at this generous sentimentof Alvar, and the crimsoned fury of his counte¬nance was instantly changed to a deadly paleness.Recovering himself, he eagerly raised Alvar,and embracing him, apologized for this pretend¬ed trial which he had put him to; highly extolledthe purity of his heart, nor failed to add how muchthe result had raised him in his own ; and, on de¬parting, assured hirn of new and increasing fa¬vours. But Alvar had too well noticed his cornuB 210tenance and sudden change, to remain free fromapprehensions. Under the cover of the night,therefore, hastening from the palace, he soughtthe abode of his beloved Seraphina. She had beenby no means easy at the situation of Alvar withMurad; dreading, as she was conscious of his gen-ewus nature, lest it should operate but too power¬fully to the disadvantage of his suffering country¬men. To remind him, therefore, of his duty, andto keep it constantly before him, she had employ¬ed her utmost skill in embroidering a rich scarf withthese words: Alvar, yield thy oath to aid Alphonso,and this becomes the pledge for Seraphina s hand..She had just finished it, when a signal at the doorannounced his arrival. Seraphina started, andthough surprised at his visiting her at an hour somuch later than that to which they had accustom¬ed themselves, yet she flew with joy to give himentrance.Alvar approached her with downcast looks; andwhen she anxiously enquired the cause, he, with atrembling accent, informed her of the whole thathad passed between him and Murad.Seraphina stood fixed in horror at his relation ;and overcome with apprehensions for his safety,sunk motionless on his bosom. He clasped her inhis arms ; and his soothing voice at length restor¬ing her, she gave vent to her sorrow in a flood oftears.Though absorbed in equal grief, he strove tocomfort her. At length the danger of his longerdelay rushed upon her mind, and she bade him fly,assuring him his life was dearer to her than herown ; and although his absence would plunge herinto the depth of misery, yet his safety would bethe subject of her constant prayer.After many mutual endearments, Alvar was11forced at length to tear himself from her; but erelie departed she bethought her of the scarf whichshe had worked for him. On her presenting himwith it he kissed it a thousand times, and read¬ing the words took a most solemn oath to obeyher injunctions: then, after fresh embraces andmutual vows, he reluctantly quitted her presence.Jacintha stood ready to conduct him throughthe garden to the gate which led into the fields;where, having joined his companions, who waitedfor him, they hastened forward on their journey.Jacintha, on her return through the garden,met Koderigo; for that crafty Spaniard, who hadbeen constantly on the watch ever since his firstdiscovery of the intercourse between Alvar andSeraphina, had seen him enter, and by the aidof all-powerful gold, soon became acquainted withthe cause of his visit at so late an hour.The treacherous Roderigo lost not a momentin letting Murad know, by a secret agent whomhe employed, of the flight of Alvar to join Alphon¬se, yet carefully concealing the name of Seraphi-na, and the love whieh Alvar held for her; wellknowing, that such an information would lose himfor ever his charming mistress.Murad was thrown into the most violent trans¬port of rage on gaining this intelligence. He in¬stantly commanded Alvar’s apartments in the palaceto be searched, and finding him gone, doubted notthe truth of what was thus imparted to him, andimmediately dispatched a party of his soldiers,headed by a favourite Moor, whom he strictlycharged to bring him the head of Alvar.Meanwhile Seraphina remained under the mostpainful apprehensions for his safety, and everymoment started with terror at some fresh idea ofB 312mischief befalling him ; and so wretched did theseSuggestions render her, that she determined to riskher own life, and immediately follow him withevery aid in her power. For this purpose shehastily summoned Ro'derigo and her servants be¬fore her, and informed them that the most urgentbusiness required her going immediately to thecountry ; and giving them money, ordered them toprocure as many men as they could engage withsufficient secrecy, and who could be depended up¬on, in the neighbourhood, to accompany them inguarding her.They cheerfully acquiesced, and prepared accor¬dingly, Roderigo alone excepted, who deeply re¬pined at the summons; but this he was forced todo in secret, as his acting otherwise would havebetrayed his knowledge of her design. He there¬fore prepared to head them, resolving within him¬self to thwart her design of succouring Alvar byevery means in his power.Seraphina having now entrusted every thing tothe care of Jacintha during her absence, and tak¬ing all the wealth which she could possibly secret,particularly her jewels, issued with her party, un¬der cover of the night, through the private entrancewhich had led Alvar to the fields, and, directed byher, they pursued the same route he had taken,she having been well informed of it ere he depart¬ed from her.The party dispatche^ by Murad had pursued atract among the woods, and they were on the bor¬ders of a tliicket when Seraphina and her partyappeared. Irani, the Moor deputed by Murad,who proceeded with extreme caution, and whoseeyes were constantly prying around him on everyobject, quickly beheld them. He lost no time insecreting himself and his followers among theISbushes, from whence he plainly discerned thatthe group was composed of Spaniards, and thatthey were conducting a lady, who, though plainlyattired, he doubted not, from her numerous attend¬ants, was of no small consequence. As they drewnear the place of his concealment, he discovered herto be of exquisite beauty; which instantly inflamedhim, that forgetting for the moment every otherconsideration, he gazed motionless at so delightfulan object. When the reflection upon his immedi¬ate commission obtruded itself, he summoned upevery argument of excuse for attacking this partybefore he proceeded farther in search of Alvar.Desire, and the hopes of a rich booty, quicklydecided him, and he waited for their near ap¬proach, that he might rush out upon them with thesure prospect of success. He no sooner beheldthem on the wished-for spot, than he sallied forth,closely followed by his attendant Moors. Thesuddenness of the attack had nearly deprived Se-raphina’s party of all power of defence; but thedespair of saving themselves by any other means,quickly furnished them with a desperate courage,which enabled them to stand the shock of theirfurious assailants, several of whom fell in the at¬tack. The Moors, from being greatly superior innumbers, quickly terminated the action, compell¬ing the Spaniards to seek their safety in flight.The terrified Seraphina, clasping her hands towardHeaven, bewailed the miserable lot which awaitedher. Iram was advancing to seize her in his arms,when a party of Spaniards suddenly rushed amongthem and checked their victorious career. Seraph¬ina, who was near falling to the earth with terrorat the approach of the furious Moor, suddenlyheard the voice of one who rushed to her deliver¬ance, and who with loud and menacing tone, ex-14claimed—“ Forbear ! proud infidel, and meet myavenging sword !”Irani started from his prey—he beheld the faceof Alvar; and the astonished Seraphina sustaineda fresh tumult in her bosom, from the joy of be¬holding him, and the fear for his life. While theSpaniards, recovering from their panic on this time¬ly aid, recommenced the action with renewed hopeand vigour; and so desperate was become thestrife, that none had survived but Alvar, whowas fiercely engaged with Irani, together withHoderigo, Perez, and two other Spaniards, thatwere opposed by a couple who now alone remain¬ed, besides Iram, of all the Moors. Roderigoand his companions had the good fortune to slayone of these, though two of the Spaniards hadscarce strength left to use their weapons, and the *other Moor appeared to shun all farther conten¬tion.At this moment a clump of earth, against whichthe foot of Alvar struck, threw him on his knees,and Iram, who was nearly spent with' the fatigueof so long a contest, with uplifted sabre, seizingthe advantage, was on the point of plunging it in¬to him. Seraphina screamed with terror at thedescending stroke, while Roderigo, now freed fromdanger, beheld with joy the approaching death ofhis rival, and seeing this was a favourable momentto secure Seraphina to himself, beckoning to Pe¬rez, who immediately followed him, rushed uponher. and seizing her in her arms, was hasteningaway with her ; while the remaining Moor, whofebackwardness in continuing the engagement pro¬ceeded not from fear, sprung upon Iram and check¬ed his arm. Alvar instantly sprung up, and withrenewed strength attacking his adversary, soon laidhim lifeless at his feet. The cries of Seraphina15prevented him thanking his deliverer; for, on turn¬ing hastily toward her, he beheld Roderigo, aidedby Perez, forcing her away. Astonished, he rushedupon him, accompanied by the Moor; but Rod¬erigo, who expected not this sudden change in thefate of Alvar, quitting her, declined all contest,and with refined hypocrisy, begged him to forbear;congratulating him on his safety, he assured him,that his only motive was to secure her from thechief of the infidels, whose success he had deemedcertain, from the desperate situation of Alvar, andthe inability which he and his companions lay un¬der, from their fatigue, of defending her from himaided by the other Moor.The generous, unsuspecting Alvar, believed hisstory, and in the height of his joy embraced him.Alvar had now leisure to thank the generousMoor for having preserved his life; and, at thesame time he requested to learn to what peculiarlive he was indebted to him for his assistance.Mosoul informed him, that Iram was alwayshis deadly foe. He hated him for his valiant deeds.Often has he,” said Mosoul, “ vowed thy de¬struction ; and when our sovereign, on thy flight,in the transport of his fury, commanded thee tobe pursued and slain, Iram joyfully stepped forth,and promised to bring him thy head, or forfeit hisown. Murad joyfully accepted the tender of hisservices, and furnished him with as many warriorsas were deemed sufficient; amongst whom I, muchagainst my will, was one—for oft have I admiredthy generous nature, and deeply repined at beingforced to seek thy death. Thus accompanied, heset off in pursuit of thee ; but meeting thy belovedSeraphina by the way, he was so inflamed with lustand the hopes of plunder, that he ventured thelives of his attendants to gratify his own inordinate16desires. Too nearly had lie succeeded in his views;but I could not behold with indifference his up¬lifted sabre, ready to take the life of the bravedefender of her honour, so I rushed forward tosave thee. Go, may Alla preserve thee fromfurther evils, and mayest thou be happy with thybeloi’ed and charming Seraphina !” Alvar partedfrom Mosoul, but not till after many embraces;and the eyes of Seraphina, glistening with regretat his departure, spoke at the same time the deepgratitude of her heart.And now the delighted Alvar passed gaily on,leading his Seraphina, who, with downcast looks,listened with rapture to his soothing voice, whichin tender: accents strove to chase from her bosomthose terrifying objects, which her late dangerous »situation had planted there.Long had they pursued their way withoutrest or refreshment; for the hand of rapine hadcreated a dreary waste around them, and those de¬licious plains, which formerly had fed vast herdsand innumerable flocks, now presented nothingbut a wide extended space, without a living objectto cheer the wandering eye. Seraphina, complain¬ing of fatigue and thirst, sat down upon the turf;Alvar anxious to afford her relief, leaving Roderi-go and Perez to guard her, proceeded in search ofwater. At a considerable distance he found abrook, and filling a small cup, which he alwayscarried about with him on a journey, he returnedto the place where he had left Seraphina. Whatwas his astonishment to find her gone! Thinkingshe and her attendants had been surprised by aparty of Moors, and carried off by these in¬fidels, with a look of despair he threw himselfupon the earth, and bitterly bewailed his misfor¬tune; then, starting up, flew with frenzied stepi17he knew not whither. Thus urged by the wildimpulse of his mind, he hastened through the wood,till its rugged surface impeded his further progress.Raging with despair at his loss, he sat down ; andwhile a deep sigh heaved from the most inward re¬cesses of his aching bosom, he cried—“ Alas ! allhope is now lied! She is lost to me forever!”Then suddenly starting up, and gazing wildlyaround him, he groaned : “ Yet through the worldwill I seek thee ! this heart shall be dead to allcomfort till thou art found l” Then w ith melan¬choly step he proceeded, and eagerly passed eachobstruction that came in his way.Meantime Seraphina, after Alvar’s departure com¬plaining of a sudden sickness, fainted in Roderigo’sarms, who, during tier insensibility, flew with heracross the wood, accompanied by Perez. On herrecovery she stared wildly around, but seeing noappearance of Alvar, in a tone of command shebade Roderigo release her, which he refused.Seraphina, in the utmost terror, filled the airwith her cries, which were answered by the roughvoice of Roderigo commanding her to be silent,or her instant destruction would ensue; while Pe¬rez, on the other hand, gazed around him in fear,or the alarm which her screams might occasion,brandished his sword over her head, witii threat¬ening looks, he trembling followed the footstepsof the base Roderigo.They had advanced, heedless of the path, until-thoroughly bewildered; they then gazed aioundthem in perplexity which way to proceed; whilethe terrified Seraphina, beholding the sword con¬stantly suspended over her, with agonized thoughts,deplored her wretched fate and her lost Alvar.It was now evening, and the twm villains were18debating upon their further tract, when a deepshade, which obscured part of the horizon, arrestingtheir eyes, they observed a large building not fardistant. Thither they instantly determined uponconducting her. As they approached it, the palebeams of the moon shone through its windows, deepchasms, and over its decayed battlements; adjoin¬ing to these, they beheld the rugged edges of roof¬less walls, all displaying the dire effects of destruc¬tive war.When they arrived at the foot of these loftyruins, which were situated upon an eminence, theycautiously surveyed them, and perceiving an en¬trance, with trepidation they ventured in, -deter¬mined to rest themselves, and debate upon theirfuture purposes.In a gloomy apartment, which only admitteddisjointed rays of tl»e moon between the ironbars of a window at a great height from the floor,they determined to secure her; while they, rest¬ing themselves, guarded the entrance. Where,after having left her, they shut the door afterthem, and seating themselves on the ground, com¬menced their consultation. In the midst of theirdiscourse, Perez, who was thoroughly fatigued, be¬gan to nod ; and though Roderigo repeatedly shookhim by the arm to keep up his attention, he atlength fell backward in a profound sleep.Roderigo, who was himself sufficiently tired,from having borne Seraphina so far in his arms,would have followed his companion’s example,had not the thoughts of having her thus in hispower raised in his breast a powerful opponentto Morpheus. A raging lust burned within him,and roused him to take advantage of her lonelysituation; and he was the further prompted to this19diabolical intention by the situation of Perez,which promised not to admit any touch of pity in¬to his bosom, sufficient for rousing him to her as¬sistance.To accomplish this purpose, after having byrest invigorated his limbs, he eagerly arose; butthe sudden bursting open of a door arrested hissteps, and fixed him motionless. The cold dropsflowed from his pale visage; his staring eyeballsrolled, accompanied with convulsive starts, aroundhim ; and, while his knees knocked together, hesought in terror the cause of his alarm. His earswere wide open to catch the least sound, dreadingone to succeed to that he had just heard.Seraphina, after her first terror had subsidedon being left in so miserable a situation, guided bydespair and the feeble light which the window af¬forded her, paced cautiously round the room, withthe hope of finding some place to Jiide herselffrom the attempts of Roderigo, which slie somuch dreaded. In the doing of which, her footstriking against some rubbish which lay in herway, threw her with violence against part of anold hanging; which giving way, her weight burstopen a door behind, and she fell prostrate into alow and arched passage. Stunned with the fall,she remained motionless and insensible for sometime; but at length, recovering, she raised herhead, and beheld, by the light of a gloomy lampwhich gleamed from an apartment to which thisavenue led, a man of grim and furious visage stand¬ing over her.Terror and apprehension robbed her of all potverof utterance. While she gazed upon him withsupplicating woe, his countenance instantly assum¬ed a milder aspect: he raised her up in his arms, andleading her from the avenue, placed her on a seat;C20then rushing with rekindled rage toward the pas¬sage, he fixed upon it his glaring eyes ; but hear¬ing no sound, he quitted the entrance and stalk¬ed, with furious muttering and brandished weapon,to the further end of the apartment; where, oftenstarting, he fixed his eyes upon the ground, andgroaned deeply.Meantime Roderigo having awakened Perez,accompanied by him, ventured to push open thedoor leading to the apartment in which Seraphinahad been confined, and peeping in, beheld the faintlight which glimmered through the vaulted entranceof the inner recess. They gazed upon each otherwith amazement and apprehension; yet at lengththey ventured, finding all still, to pass through thefirst apartment, and approach the passage ; wherethey beheld, with astonishment, Seraphina seatedby the trembling flame, and leaning dejectedlyupon her hand.The furious Spaniard, who had assisted her,was fixed in deep and convulsed agitation ofmind, with his eyes rivetted on the earth, at a dis¬tance, and out of sight from the entrance; andthe cautious observers of Seraphina, conceivingher to be alone, though unable to account for thelight, determined to seize her; and rushing in,were on the point of accomplishing their purpose,when her screams, and the sight ot her assailants,roused the agonized Spaniard. Darting upon themwith his sword, he exclaimed, with frenzied looks,“ Come on, my brave countrymen, and aided bythis arm, drive the murderous infidels before you !thus let us avenge our wrongs !”Roderigo and Perez, surprized and terrified,started from their prey; and though they saw butone, who with fury rushed upon them, their fright¬ened imaginations made them fancy his com pa-21nions at his iieels. With the utmost speed whichsudden panic could impart, they lied before him;and rushing from the shattered mansion, scram¬bling over the fragments of its ruins, thus savedthemselves from the enraged Spaniard, who follow¬ed them ; but the darkness of the night impededIds pursuit.He now returned to Seraphina, who had remain¬ed in the deepest anxiety for his success, and en¬tering with triumphant looks, loudly exclaimed,“ Banish all apprehensions, fair mourner ; this armshall drive thy foes before it.—it has ever protect¬ed female innocence.” Here he started, and strik¬ing his bosom gave a deep groan ; then, raisinghis eyes towrard heaven, the big tear rolled downhis cheek, and mingled with his deeply-clottedbeard. Seraphina gazed on him with pity, andher bosom heaved with sympathizing w oe: “ Mayheaven relieve the sorrows of thy heart!” exclaim¬ed she.—He gazed upon her with discomposed, yetthankful aspect, and was struggling within him¬self to make a reply, when the sound of a footstepin the passage, cautiously advancing, arrested theirattention.Seraphina was seized with fresh alarm, and furyglowed anew upon the countenance of the Spaniard.Drawing again his sword, he rushed forward; andnow the repeated clashing of weapons in the arch¬ed entrance, struck her terrified ear. Long wasthe contention; but at length the Spaniard wasforced to retire before his adversary, and, fightingbravely with undiminished valour, re-entered thechambert Dismay seized upon the heart of Se¬raphina, at seeing her defender so hard pressed;and, with her hands clasped towards heaven, sheearnestly prayed for his success.While she was thus employed, the prosperous22assailant, following his opposer, pressed hard uponhim, until the sight of Seraphina palsied his arm.The Spaniard, viewing his advantage, rushedupon, him, while he, unable to recover himself, fellback upon one knee ; and his antagonist, with up¬lifted weapon, was preparing to strike, when Se¬raphina, screaming, rushed forward. She threwherself before him, and, with her arm opposed tothe descending sword, exclaimed, <{ Oh ! spare,spare my Alvar !” The Spaniard, checking theblow which had almost fallen, viewed them alter¬nately in astonishment. He recoiled a few paces,and Alvar, springing up, caught Seraphina in hisarms.After the first transports of their meeting wereover, she failed not to represent to him, withthe warmest glow of gratitude, how much she hadbeen indebted to the stranger for his protection,and related the whole of the circumstances attend¬ing her deliverance.Alvar, transported with joy, flew to embracehim, and hailed him as the preserver of all thatwas dear to him. The Spaniard, after returninghis salutations, with a momentary joy beamingupon his countenance, caught him in his arms,and eagerly exclaimed, “ While the dawn nowinvites us to pursue our journey, delay maybe attended with danger. Thou mayest standin need of my further assistance—I must attendthee !”—Alvar consented, and they pursued theirjourney. As they silently proceeded through thewood, a band of troops suddenly rushed out froma thicket and attacked them. Alvar and theSpaniard, unable to defend themselves from theirassailants, were forced to retreat, leaving Seraphi¬na in the hands of the Moors. What was the agonyof Alvar, on seeing his beloved Seraphina placed23on horseback behind one of the Moors, and thewhole body gallop off across the forest. He fol¬lowed at a distance, and saw them enter a largebuilding situated upon an eminence, which, fromthe soldiers around it, appeared to be a garrisonof the Moors.The Spaniard stood petrified with agony at thesight; and, when he had at last recovered thepower of utterance, with a deep sigh, he exclaim¬ed—“ Alas! Seraphina, to what fresh miseries artthou doomed ! while thy wretched Alvar is thusdenied the means of yielding thee aid.” “ De¬nied ! No !” cried Alvar, “ I will instantly fly tosuccour my beloved, even though I perish in theattempt.” Then turning from the Spaniard, hiseyes met the body of one of the Moqrs who hadfallen beneath his sword, and a sudden thoughttook possession of his mind. “ Yes !” cried he,“ that dress may enable me to behold my Seraph¬ina once more.” In vain did the Spaniard en¬deavour to display the rashness of the attempt;but finding him firm in his determination, he as¬sisted him in stripping the body of the Moor.,Alvar, after having put on the Moorish dress,thought of staining his face a deep brown. Thishe easily affected, by the assistance of berries,which he found in the woods, while a clear streamserved to view himself in.Bidding the Spaniard farewell, he pursued hisway towards the building in which Seraphina was-confined, while the Spaniard continued to gazeafter him until his figure was lost amongst thewoods, and then hurried on in a different direc¬tion, muttering curses and vengeance on the heads•of those who had dared to snatch her fromthem. With hurried step, and lost in thought,.24lie wandered so far, that the night began to obscurethe horizon, which soon grew so dark, that heknew not which way to proceed farther; but per¬ceiving a light at a distance, he bent his steps to¬ward it, and found it to issue from the window ofa cottage. Arriving at the door, he knocked loud¬ly for admittance; and a voice from w'ithin de¬manded w hat he wanted. He answered that hehad lost his way, and wished shelter for the night;on which the door w'as opened by an old woman,who, perceiving by her light that he was a Span¬iard, bade him enter.On his entrance, he perceived a man seated overa few nearly-extinguished embers, w ho desired himto rest himself. Observing a gloom of melancholyto cloud their brows, he asked the cause of it.The woman with a sigh said, their dejected appear¬ance proceeded from the loss of a beloved boy,who was the prop of their feeble age. “ A son !”cried the Spaniard. “ No ! wTe cannot say he wasour own, but he was reared by us from his child¬hood, and his great affection to us,” said she,“ rendered him as dear as if he had.” The Span¬iard begged to know how they had lost him.“ Thou shalt hear, signior,” replied the woman.“ It is now many years since my husband, whomyou now see before you, and myself resided in acottage far distant from this spot, wrhere we sup¬ported ourselves by selling such refreshments aswere necessary to the traveller. Soon after thearrival of the Moors, a party of them, mounted,arrived at our house ; behind one of whom was alady, richly attired, who, in the utmost agitation,and bathed in tears, clasped an infant fondly toher breast. They forced her to alight, and enter¬ing the house with her, called for liquor, of whichthey drank freely, and it w as not long before a25violent contention arose amongst them for the pos¬session of her. Amid their struggling she swoon¬ed away—I caught the infant from her arms, topreserve it for her; and gave it into the hands ofa young girl who assisted us in our business, whileI gave its unfortunate mother all the aid in mypower. But as soon as she had somewhat recov¬ered, one of the most furious amongst them, catch¬ing her in his arms, rushed out with her, andplacing her on his horse, sprung up behind her,and rode swiftly away, while with her utmoststrength she called eagerly for her child—and therest, mounting their horses, as speedily followedhim. The child had a crucifix set with diamondsround his neck. We trained him up as our son, andnamed him Henriquez; but at the age of eighteenwe lost him. We suspect he joined the army,and have long feared that he must have losthis life in some of the engagements with the Infi¬dels, having never since heard any thing of him.A few hours after his departure, looking for thecrucifix, I found it gone ; but recollecting that Ihad told him all the particulars respecting himself,and had shown it to him, I suspect he took it awaywith him when he left us.”The Spaniard appeared deeply agitated duringthe whole of her narrative ; and when she hadfinished, clasping his hands upon his bosom, hegave a deep groan, and remained for a long timein profound musing.Alvar in the meantime had arrived at the footof the garrison, where he beheld none but thecentinels, who were pacing silently before it. Aftercalling to them, he informed them that he wishedto take shelter within. He was conducted imme¬diately to the otficer on guard; to whom, onbeing questioned, he related a story which he26iiad previously fabricated for the purpose ; and toldthat his name was Elbrahaud. After congratulat¬ing him upon his arrival among them, they ledhim to a chamber, and placed before him theirchoicest wines, together with a variety of other re¬freshments, of which they all partook. Univer¬sal mirth now prevailed, except in the bosom ofAlvar, which heaved for a sight of his beloved Se-raphina, and he was deeply impressed with sorrow,notwithstanding the outward joy which he wasunder the necessity of assuming. From his com¬panions he learned, that Alphonso was hourly ex¬pected to assaidt the castle, that the women a fewhours before had quitted the fortress under a strongguard to the royal seraglio, and that the prisonerswere conveyed to a strong dungeon beneath thecourt. Alvar having expressed a wish to seethe enemies of his faith groaning in captivity,one of the Moors, who was the gaoler, with asmile bade him follow him, led him to the placeof their confinement. Pie unlocked the gate, andthe heart of Alvar shuddered as he beheld the pi¬tiable state of those unfortunate Spaniards.Some were reclining upon heaps of straw;others, silently, and with downcast eyes, pacedwith heavy step the dungeon’s narrow bounds.Pale and dejected, they all seemed to long, amidthe loud and terrifying clanking of their chains,for the arm of the executioner, to relieve them fromthe horrors of their confinement, and the noxiousair they were forced to breathe.At length the hour of rest came, and each soughthis repose, leaving Alvar to follow their example,by retiring to the spot assigned for him. Pie nmvconceived Seraphina to be lost to him for ever.Busy thought drove away sleep, and he spent seve¬ral hours in an agitation of mind which bordered27upon frenzy, when he was suddenly roused by theloud shouts of those who surrounded the castle;while the Moors, grasping their arms, flew to itsdefence. It was hemmed in on all sides by a largeparty of Spaniards, who furiously assaulted it.Alvar, fired by the occasion, longed to join hiscountrymen ; but this was at present impossible.On the first alarm he therefore made a show of en¬gaging on the side of the Moors; but while do¬ing this, he eagerly sought an opportunity of tak¬ing his advantage for executing what he had re¬solved upon.The Spaniards had by this time gained the ram¬parts, where the conflict became desperate. Thedetermined valour of the Moors, however, wassuch, as at length to repulse their enemies in everyattempt to enter the castle ; and now Alvar judg¬ed the time to be arrived for striking a decisiveblow.Hastening therefore to the dungeon, he undrewI the bolts, and called the prisoners forth ; and thenleading them to the armoury, bade them arm them¬selves. The prisoners, in fearful amazement obey¬ed; while he, placing himself at their head, display¬ed the brilliant cross upon his bosom, whichhe had so long concealed, as the pledge of hissuperior birth. With these, his desperate coun¬trymen, he charged upon the rear of the infidels,just as Alphonso and his old friend the Spaniard,who headed the attack, were on the point of givingway.The Moors were astonished, and confounded atthis unexpected assault, which thus placed themin the midst of their fierce assailing foes. The8 Spaniards at their front seeing this timely aid, andbeing hailed, with loud shouts, by their long suffer¬ing countrymen, who, struggling for freedom, had28hastened thus to their assistance, flew with re¬doubled ardour to the attack. Now a dread¬ful carnage ensued ; the Moors were slaughteredon all sides, yet they continued the contest with avigour which was heightened by despair.At this moment the perturbed Spaniard, whowas rushing impetuously among the infidels, deal¬ing slaughter around him, on beholding Alvarwith the glittering cross suspended on his bosomheaping destruction on every side, started at thesight of this badge, while his uplifted* arm hungin the air, and spared the daunted foe. Butspeedily recovering himself, he no longer pausedfrom his victorious career; and Alphonso follow¬ing with his chosen band, a complete route en¬sued.Immediately after their final success, the Span¬iard, whose attention during the battle had been sopowerfully arrested by the sight of Alvar underIns Moorish disguise, and particularly by the spark¬ling cross which shone upon his bosom, sprungto him, and catching him in his arms, with strongemotion and eager tone, exclaimed, “ Oh ! myson—my son ! that precious emblem, which adornsthy bosom, proclaims thee mine ! long hast thoubeen lost, but I now behold thee, even under thatdisguise, and survey a hero!” He then, aftermany endearments, related to the astonished Alvarall that he had learned at the cottage; to whichhe added, “ That cross which is now before theeI gave thy mother!” Alvar, happy in beholdinghis sire, dropped upon his knee, and grasping thehand of a parent, hitherto known to him only asa sincere friend, kissed it with filial reverence andtransport; while the Spaniard, whose reason seem¬ed to have recovered its perfect state on the resto¬ration of his child, hung over him, and with tearsof joy tenderly embraced him.29Alplionso, who beheld this scene, felt deeply af¬fected ; yet he stood looking with surprise at Alvar'sMoorish habit and appearance, until the Span¬iard perceiving it* led Alvar to him, and thusspoke: “ Behold, great prince, my son clothed inthis disguise, to whom We owe the bright successthis day hath witnessed. My name is Don ManuelD’Aranda, and he was baptized by the name ofI'erdinando—Yes, beneath this Moorish sem¬blance, behold that Alvar, so wrell known to both.Under this disguise hath he sought through nu¬merous perils his persecuted Seraphina, to releasewhom he had entered this castle.” Alphonso,after clasping the brave Ferdinando to his heart, ,anxiously enquired for Seraphina. The unhappyFerdinando x'elated his misfortunes, and they ten¬derly sympathised with him in his loss.Then, Alphonso, after leaving with Ferdinandoa sufficient number of soldiers, together with thosewho had joined Don Manuel on his way to hiscamp, created him governor of the castle, and oneof his chief generals Don Manuel would by nomeans quit his beloved son ; and Alphonso, ac¬companied by the remainder of his troops, re¬turned to his encampment.As Ferdinando was returning from one of thoseexpeditions in which he had subdued a numerousparty of the infidels, he passed over a wide extendingforest; where, as he and his followers eagerly pur¬sued their track, the darkened firmament proclaim¬ed a storm at hand; and while they strove, byincreasing their speed, to elude its vengeance, adeep gloom surrounded them, and they beheldwith terror the vivid flash of the^Jightning, whichshone with reflected lustre on their burnished ar¬mour.A heavy torrent accompanied the awful scene,30and poured its fury on their heads ; but a neigh¬bouring wood at length afforded them shelter un¬der its spreading branches.At length the heavens, freed from the ragingelements, began to re-assume their blue serenity.—While Ferdinando and his troops beheld withjoy the increasing splendour of the scene, they ob¬served, at a small distance from them, a prostratefemale, who had fallen at the foot of a scorchedelm. They hastened to the spot, and raising herfrom the earth, saw a pale and emaciated visage,unblasted by the fire of heaven, but which had be¬come the prey of famine. With refreshments,which they brought with them, they strove torecall her nearly departed life. In vain they stroveto cheer her, as returning thought poured thestream of sorrow down her wan and hollow cheek;yet she suffered them at length to bear her fromthe spot, and place her on one of their steeds;where, secured by the protection of its rider, theyconveyed her to the castle.They np sooner arrived, than Don Manuel has¬tened to welcome his son’s return ; but he nosooner beheld the distressed female than he start¬ed back. While his eyes were fixed on her inamazement, the violent agitation of his mind shookhis whole frame, and he stood rivetted to the spot.But the object of his wonder no sooner beheldhim, than summoning all her remaining strength,she rushed forward, and throwing her arms a-round his neck, sunk motionless upon his bosom.On her recovery, and after their mutual endear¬ments on so blessed and unexpected a meeting hadceased, “Behold, my son!” said Don Manuel, “ thatparent who yielaed thee to the light of heaven,and whom, while to thee a stranger, thy tender31care hath snatched from surrounding perils, andsufferings long sustained. At these words thewife of Don Manuel fixed her eyes on Ferdinando;and, hurrying to him with strong emotion, caughthim in her arms, while joy, which in vain struggledfor utterance, heaved within her bosom.Meantime, Don Manuel, impatient to learn bywhat means his consort had escaped from thosedangers which surrounded her amidst the fury ofthe Moors, requested her to satisfy his anxiouscuriosity ; which she did in the following words :“ While you,” said she to Don Manuel, “ wasabsent in the army of our King Sebastian, whichstrove, in various engagements, to repel the in¬cursions of the Moors, your castle was attackedby a large body of them. Notwithstanding thebrave resistance made by those whom you leftto guard it, they gained possession, and with un¬relenting fury put to the sword all its intrepid de¬fenders who survived the fierce assault. Catchingup our child, I flew in terror to the apartmentsmost remote from the dreadful scene of carnage.Hut it was in vain, for the leader of the Moors pur¬sued me, and catching me in his arms, heedless ofmy cries and those of my infant, whom I shelter¬ed closely in my bosom, bore me to his victoriousband, and placing me upon his horse, held mebefore him, while he swiftly led them from thespot.“ They flew with rapidity across the country,until they came to a small cottage where wine wassold; here they stopped for refreshment, and theliquor which they drank enflaming some of theparty to gain possession of me, a violent conten¬tion arose amongst them. The sight of themdrawing their sabres, together with the fatigue andagitation of mind which I had endured, caused meto swoon. D32“ On my recovery, seeing my ciiild in the armsof a woman near me, I eagerly stretched out myarms for him, but the Moor who had first seizedme caught me up, and regardless of my entreatiesfor my infant, placed me again on his steed, androde swiftly away; the rest, mounting their horses,followed him. Afterwards, dismissing his party, heconveyed me to an old mansion, surrounded on everyside by lofty trees, where he committed me to thecare of an old woman, bidding her see me well at¬tended ; he then spurred his steed, and was in a mo¬ment out of sight. A raging fever seized me, andfrom that instant all recollection forsook my mind:and, I was afterwards informed, insanity possessedme. In the end, however, the power of medicinerecovered my faculties, and I was soon enabled toleave my bed. The Moor then sent me notice, thaton tl:e approaching evening he had determined onvisiting me; my heart sunk within me at this in¬telligence, and I saw no means of escaping theruin that awaited me. The windows of my apart¬ment were covered with a close lattice-work, andlooked into an adjoining wood. They were secure-Jv fastened, yet my desperate situation, which urgedme to any attempt, made me resolve to burst oneof them open.“ My strength proved for a long time unavail¬ing, but despair giving me additional power, I atlength succeeded, and gazed around me with a ris-in<> hope; which, however, was soon damped, onbeholding beneath, and close to the base of themansion, a narrow river.“ However desperation seized me, and, dreadingnothing but of the designs which the Moor hadupon my person, I threw myself headlong fromthe window. The water received me on my fall,and on recovering, I saw a man standing over me.anxiously affording me every assistance in hispower. I surveyed him with gratitude, and assoon as I was able to rise he led me to a cottage.He informed me that he had seen me throw myselfinto the river, and had immediately sprung in andsaved me. I remained for sometime with this goodpeasant and his wife, until my strength permittedme to travel ; then bidding them farewell, I wan¬dered through the woods in search of my infant. Mymisfortunes again bereft me of reason, and whenthe fit went off, I found myself in the house of apeasant, surrounded by his smiling family, HereI passed many tedious and mournful hours, untilhappening to lose my way, I had wandered longwithout sustenance, when the storm laid me sense¬less on the earth, where I was found by you, mydear and long lamented son.”Iltoderigo and Perez, on leaving the ruin in theforest, proceeded to Murad’s court and entered hisarmy, where Itoderigo’s prowess soon obtained himpromotion ; and with pleasure he beheld Seraphinaarrive with the other slaves, at the royal seraglio.Murad, kept in constant alarm by the daily accountsof Ferdinando’s success and encreasing power, de¬termined upon collecting his forces together, andto conquer him, ere his adherents were farthermultiplied ; he therefore appointed Koderigo, un¬der the assumed name of Valentio, to guard thepalace during his absence, while he set forward onthis expedition with the flower of his troops.The aged Sebastian who had been long confinedin a gloomy dungeon, one day discovered a secretdoor, held by a bolt, which he undrew, and pass¬ed into a large chamber. At the further endhe saw a passage, and on the floor lay a bar ofiron; this he took up, and entered the passage.34Meantime Roderigo, under the title of Valentio,finding all his love revive at having Seraphina inhis power, had entered her apartment, and seizingher in his arms, was resolved to delay his desin^s'no longer. Her strength was exhausted, for invain her cries echoed throughout the apartment, jand Roderigo had her completely in his power,when a door at the further end of the room burst .!open, and the aged Sebastian entered. Roderigo;instantly started from his prey; while Sebas¬tian, beholding his base attempt, rushed upon rhim, brandishing his bar of iron. The foul ra- •visher fled with dismay, and Sebastian no sooner 1saw him depart than he hurried to Seraphina, andused every effort to comfort her; but recollecting|the danger of remaining too long from his dun¬geon, he bade her adieu.Meantime Murad advanced rapidly against Fer-dinando; the two armies met, and a bloody conflictensued. Early in the engagement Murad attackedthe brave Ferdinando, who soon laid the proud in¬fidel lifeless on the ground, and rout and universalslaughter ensued, until the Moors were at last for- fced to lay down their arms.This happy kingdom was now free. The joy fof their deliverance appeared on every face, and |while the Prince embraced Ferdinando, he publicly fhailed him the Spanish champion—the deliverer 1of his country.Surrounded by loud shouts of victory, Alphonsoand Ferdinando hastened to the palace, and foundtheir aged sovereign. They told him the events ofthe day; but he resigned his crown to his son.Ferdinando soon found Seraphina, and the uni¬versal joy was encreased by the union of these twolovers.FINIS.

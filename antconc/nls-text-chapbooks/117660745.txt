1/DREADFUL NARRATIVEEAST lAMMAJSAA,BY FIRE,In the middle of the Atlantic Ocean, withupwards of 600 souls on board.ACCOUNT OF THE DREADFUL SUFFERINGSTHE ISLAND OF ST. HELENA.GLASGOW:PRINTED FOR THE BOOKSELLERS.1 OF SuVTt•  THELOSS OF THE KENTEAST-INDIAMAN.The Kent, Captain Henry Cobb, a fine newship of 1350 tons, bound to Bengal and China,lelt the Downs on the 19th February, with 20officers, 344 soldiers, 43 women, and 66children, belonging to the 31st regima|t:with 20 private passengers, and(including officers) of 148 men, on board.W ith a fine fresh breeze from the north¬east, the stately Kent, in bearing down theChannel, speedily passed many a well-knownspot on the cost, dear to our rememberance ;and on the evening of the 23d we took ourlast vew of happy England, and entered thewide Atlantic, without the expectation ofagain seeing land till we reached the shoresof India.With slight interruptions of bad weatherwe continued to make way until the night ofMonday the 28th, when we were arrestedin lat. ^7- 30* long. Id by a violent gale fromthe south-west, which gradually increasedduring the whole of the following morning.The activity of the officers and seamen of theKent appeared to keep ample pace with thatof the gale, ©ur large sails were speedilytaken in, or closely reefed ; and about 10 o’dock on the morning of the 1st of March,after having struck our top-gallent yards,, wewere lying to, under a triple reefed main top^sail only, with our dead lights in, and with |hewhole watch of soldiers attached to the Fifelines, that were run along the deck for thispurpose.The rolling of the ship which was vastlyincreased by a dead weight of some hundredtons of shot and shells that formed a partof its lading, became so great about half pasteleven or twelve o’clock, that our main chainswere thrown by every lurch considerably un¬der waterand the best cleated articles offurniture in the cabins and the cuddy weredashed about with so much noise and violenceas to excit the liveliest apprehensions of indi¬vidual danger.It was a little before this period that one ofthe officers of the ship, with the well meantintention of ascertaining that all was fast be¬low, descended with two of the sailors intothe hold, where they carried with them, forsafety, a light in the patent lantern; andseeing that the lamp burned dimly, the officertook the precaution to hand it up to the orlopdeck to be trimmed. Having afterwards dis¬covered one ofthe spirit casks to be adrift, hesent the sailoiVibr some billets of wood tosecure it: but the ship in their absence havingmade a heavy lurch, the officer unfortunatelydropped the light; and letting^go his hold of5the cask in his eagerness to recover the lan¬tern, it suddenly stove, and the spirits com¬municating with the lamp, the whole placewas instantly in a blaze.I know not what steps were then taken;but having received the alarming informationthat the ship was on fire in the after hold, Ihastend to the hatchway, whence smoke wasslowly ascending, and where Capt. Cobb andother officers were giving orders, which werepromptly obeyed by the seamen and troops,who used every exertion by means of thepumps, buckets of water, wet sails, hammocks&c. to extinguish the flames. Finding, how¬ever, that the devouring element was rapidlyspreading, and that volumes of smoke were is¬suing from all the four hatchways, CaptainCobh, with ability and decision of characterthat seemed to increase with the imminenceof the danger, resorted to the only alterna¬tive now left him, of ordering the lower portsto be opened, for the free admission of the wa¬tery element.These instructions were speedily executedby the united efforts of the troops and sea¬men ; but not before some of the sick soldiers,and one woman, and several children, unableto gain the upper deck, had perished. Sodense and oppressive was the smoke, that itwas with the utmost difficulty we could remainlong enough below to fulfil Captain Cobb’swishes ; which were no sooner accomplished,then the sea rushed in with extraordinaryforce, carrying away in its resistless progressto the hold, the largest chests, bulk-heads,&c.6The upper fleck was covered with betweensix and seven hundred human beings, manyof whom, from previous sea sickness, wereforced ou the first alarm to flee from below ina state of absolute nakedness, and were nowrunning about in quest of husbands, children,or parents. While some were standing insilent resignation, or in stupid insensibility totheir impending fate, others were yieldingthemselves up to the most frantic despair.Some on their knees were earnestly imploring,with significant gesticulations and in noisysupplications, the mercy of him, whose arm,they exclaimed, was at length outstretchedto smite them ; others were to be seen hastilycrossing themselves, and performing the vari¬ous external acts required by their peculiarpersuasion, while a number of the older andstout-hearted soldiers and sailors, sullenlytook their seats directly over the magazine,hoping, as they stated, that by means of theexplosion which they every instant expecteda speedier termination might thereby be putto their sufferings.While we thus lay in a state of physicalinertion, but with all our mental faculties iurapid and painful activity,—with the waveslashing furiously against the side of our de¬voted ship, as if in anger with the hostile ele¬ment for not more speedily performing itsoffice of destruction,—the binnacle, by oneof those heavy lurches which wa* drivingeverything moveable from side to side of thevessel, was suddenly wrenched from its fas¬tenings, and all the apparatus of the compass7dashed to pieces upon the deck ; on M-hieh oneof the young mates, emphatically regardingit for a moment, cried out with the emotion sonatural to a sailor under such circumstances,“ What! is the Kent’s compass really gone ?”leaving the bystanders to form, from thatomen, their own conclusions. Mr Thomson,the 4th mate, sent a man to the fore-top, ra¬ther with the ardent wish, than the expecta¬tion, that some friendly sail might be disco¬vered on the face of the waters. The sailor,on mounting, threw his eyes round the hori-zon for a moment,—a moment of unutterablesuspense,—and waving his hat exclaimed, “ Asail on the lee bow The joyful announce¬ment was received with deep-felt thanksgiv¬ing, and with three cheers upon deck. Ourflags of distress were instantly hoisted, andour minute guns fired ; and we bore downunder our three top-sails and fore-sail upnothe stranger, which afterwards proved to bethe Cambria, a small brig of 20Q tons bur¬den—:Cook—bound to Vera Cruz having onboard 20 or 30 Cornish miners, and others,agents of the Anglo-Mexican Company.For ten or fifteen minutes we were left indoubt whether the brig perceived our signals,or perceiving them, was disposed to lend usany assistance. From the violence of thegale, it seems, that the reports of our gunswas not heard ; but the ascending volumes ofsmoke from our ship sufficiently announced thedreadful nature of our distress ; and we hadthe satisfaction, after a short period of darksuspense, to see the brig hoist British colours,and crowd all sail to hasten to our relief.8Although it was impossible, and wouldhave been improper, to repress the risinghopes that were pretty generally diffusedamongst us by the unexpected sight of theCambria, yet I confess, when I -reflected onthe long period our ship had been alreadyburning—on the tremendous sea that wasrunning—on the extreme smallness of thebrig, and the immense number of humanbeings to be saved, I could only venture tohope that a few might be spared; but I durstnot for a moment contemplate the possibilityof my own preserservation.While Captain Cobb, Colonel Fearon, theCommanding Officer of the troops, and MajorMaegregor of the 31st regiment, were con¬sulting together, as the brig was approachingus, on the necessary preparations for gettingout the boats, &c., one of the officers askedMajor M. in what order it was intended theofficers should move off; to which the otherreplied, “ Of course in funeral order whichinjunction was instantly confirmed by ColonelFearon, who said, “ Most undoubtedly, thejuniors first—but see that any man is cut.down who presumes to enter the boats beforethe means of escape are offered to the womenand children."To prevent the rush to the boats, as theywere being lowered, which, from certainsymptoms of impatience manifested both bysoldiers and sailors, there was no reason tofoar; some of the military officers were sta¬tioned over them with drawn swords. Butfrom the firm determination which these ex-9jiibitec^and the great subordination observed,with few exceptions, ty the troops, this pro¬per precaution was afterwards rendered un¬necessary.Arrangements Tiaving been consideratelymade by Captain Cobb for placing in the firstfioat, previous to letting it down, all theladies, and as many of the soldiers’ wives asit could safely contain, they hurriedly wraptthemselves up in whatever articles of cloth¬ing could be most conveniently found; and Ithink about two, or half-past two o’clock, amost mournful procession advanced from theafter cabins to the starboard-cuddy port, out¬side of which the cutter was suspended.Scarcely a word was uttered—not a screamwas heard—even the infants ceased to cry, asif conscious of the unspoken and unspeakableanguish that was at that instant rending thehearts of their parting parents-—nor was thesilence of voices in any way broken, except inone or two cases, where the ladies plaintivelyentreated permission to be left behind withtheir husbands. But on being assured thatevery moment’s delay might occasion the sa¬crifice of a human life, they successively suf¬fered themselves to be torn from the tenderembrace, and with the fortitude which neverfails to characterise and adorn their sex on oc¬casions of overwhelming trial, were placed,without a murmur, in the boat, which was im¬mediately lowered into a sea so tempestuous,as to leave us only “ to hope against hope’’that it should live in it for a single moment.Twice the cry was heard from those on tint10chains that the boat was swamping', But hewho enabled the Apostle Petei* to walk onthe face of the deep, and was graciously at¬tending to the earnest but silent aspirationsof those on board, had decreed its safety. Thetackle, after considerable ^difficulty, was un¬hooked—the boat was dexterously clearedfrom the ship, and after a while was seen frontthe poop, battling with the billows ;—no\vraised in its progress to thb brig, like aspeck on the summit, and then* disappearingfor several seconds, as if eugulfed “ in thehorrid vale between them. The Cambriahaving prudently lain at some distance fromthe Kent, lest she should be involved in herexplosion, or exposed to the fire from our gunswhich, being all shotted, afterwards went oftas the flames successively readied them, themen had a considerable way to row ; and thesuccess of this first experiment seeming to bethe measure of our future hopes, the move¬ments of this precious boat—incalculably pre¬cious, without doubt to the agonized husbandsand fathers immediately connected with it,— were watched with intense anxiety by allonboard. In the course of twenty minutes,it was seen alohgtide the “ ark of refngeand the first human being that happened to beadmitted, out of the vast assemblage that ul¬timately found shelter there, was the infantson of of Major MacGregor, a child of only afew weeks old, who was caught from his mo¬ther’s arms, and lifted into the brig by MrThomson, the 4th mate of the Kent.I have been told by one abundantly capable11v>f judging, that the feeling of oppressive de¬light, gratitude, and praise, experienced bythe married officers and soldiers, on bein? as¬sured of the safety of their wives arid child¬ren, so entirely abstracted their minds fromtheir own situation, as to render them for alittle while afterwards totally insensible eitherto the storm that beat upon them, or to theactive and gathering volcano that threatenedevery instant to explode under their feet.It being impossible for the boats, after thefirst trip, to come alongside the Kent, a planwas adopted for lowering the women and chil¬dren by ropes from the stern, by tyihg themtwo and two together. But from the heavingof the ship, and the extreme difficulty indropping them at the instant the boat was un¬derneath, many of the poor creatures wereunavoidably pluriged repeatedly under water;and as much as humanity may rejoice thatno women was eventually lost by this process,yet it was impossible to prevent, as it wasdeplorable to witness, the great sacrifice itoccasioned of the younger children,—the sameviolent means which only reduced the parentsto a state of exhaustion or insensibility, havingentirely extinguished the vital spark in thefeebler frames of the infants that were fas¬tened to them.Amid the conflicting feelings and disposi¬tions manifested by the numerous actors inthis melancholy drama many affecting proofswere elicited of paternal and filial affection,that seemed to shed a momentary halo aroundthe gloomy scene.12Twa or three soldiers, to relieve their wivesof a part of their families, sprang- into thewater with their children, and perished intheir endeavours to save them. One younglady who had resolutely refused to quit herfather, whose sense of duty kept him at hispost, was near falling a sacrifice to her filialdevotion, not having been picked up by thosein the boat until she had sunk five or six times.Another individual, who was reduced to thefrightful alternative of losing his wife or hischildren, hastily decided in favour of his dutyto the former. His wife was accordinglysaved, but his four children, alas ! were left toperish. A fine young fellow, a soldier, whohad neither wife nor child of his own, but whoevinced the greatest solicitude for the safetyof those of others, insisted on having threechildren lashed to him, with whom he plungedinto the water; not being able to reach theboat, he was again drawn into the ship withhis charge, but not before two of the childrenhad expired. One man fell down the hatch¬way into the flames, and another had his backso completely broken as to have been observedquite doubled fallen overboard. These nume¬rous spectacles of individual loss and sufferingwere not confined to the entrance upon theperilous voyage between the two ships. Oneman, who fell between the boat and the brig,had his head literally crushed to pieces; andsome others were lost in their attempts toascend the side of the Cambria.Seeing that the tardy means employed forthe escape of the women and children, necea-Bai^ily consumed a great deal of time thatmight be partly devoted to the general pre¬servation, orders were given that along withthe females, each of the boats should alsoadmit a certain portion of the soldiers; severalof whom, in their impatience to take advan¬tage of this permission, flung themselves over¬board, and sunk in their ill-judged and prema¬ture efforts for deliverance.One poor fellow of this number, a very re¬spectable man, had actually reached the boat,and was raising his hand to lay hold of thegunnel, when the bow of the boat, by a sud ¬den pitch, struck him on the head, and he in¬stantly went down. There was a peculiarityattending this man’s case that deserves notice.His wife to whom he was warmly attached,net having been of the allotted number of wo¬men to accompany the regiment abroad, re¬solved in her anxiety to follow her husband,to defeat this arrangement, and accordinglyrepaired with the detachment to Gravesend,where she ingeniously managed, by eludingthe vigilance of the sentries, to get on board,and to conceal herself for several days; andalthough she was discovered, and sent ashoreat Heal, she cofttrived a second time, withtrue femenine perseverance, to get betweendecks, where she continued to secret herselfuntil the morning of the fatal disaster.While the men were thus bent in variousways on self-preservation, one of the sailors,who had taken his post with many others overthe magazine, awaiting with great patiencethe dreaded explosion, at last cried out, as ifin ill humour that his expectation was likely14to be disappointed, “ Well Hf she won’t blowup, I’ll see if I can’t get out of her j” and in¬stantly jumping up, he made the best of hisway to one of the boats which' I understandhe reached in safety.I ought to state, that three ont of the sixboats we originally possessed, were eithercompletely stove or swamped in the course ofthe day, one of them with men in it, some ofwhom were seen floating in tile water for amoment before they disappeared; and it issuspected that one or two of those who wentdown must have sunk under the weight oftheir spoils, the same individuals having beenseen eagerly plundering the cuddy cabins.As the day was rapidly drawing to a close,and the flames were slowly, but perceptiblyextending; Colonel Fearon and Captain Cobbevinced an increasing anxiety to relieve theremainder of the gallant men under theircharge.To facilitate this object, a rope was sus¬pended from the extremity of the spankerboom, along which the men were recom-mended to proceed, and thence slide downby the rope into the boats. But as from thegreat swell in the sea, and the constant heav¬ing of the ship, it was impossible for the boatsto preserve their station for a^moment; thosewho adopted this course incurred so great arisk of swinging for some time in the air,and of being repeatedly plunged under water,or dashed against the sides of the boats un¬derneath, that many of the landsmen continuedto throw themselves out of the stern windowson the upper decks, preferring; what appearedto me the more precarious chance of reachingthe boats by swimming, Rafts made ofspars, hencoops, &c. wete also ordered to beconstructed, for the twofold purpose of form¬ing an intermediate communication with theboats,—a purpose by the bye, which they veryimperfectly answered,—and of serving as alast point of retreat, should the extension ofthe flames compel us to desert the vessel alto¬gether.The gradual removal of the officers was atthe saimj time commenced, and was marked bya discipline the most rigid, and intrepidity themost exemplary; none appearing to be influ¬enced *,by a vain and ostentatious bravery,which in cases of extreme peril, affords rathera presumtive proof of secret timidity than offortitude, nor any betraying an unmanly orunsolderlike impatience to quit the ship ; butwith the becoming deportment of men neitherparalyzed by, nor stupidly insensible to, theaccumulating dangers that encompassed them,they progressively departed in the differentboats with iheir soldiers. They who hap¬pened to proceed first, leaving behind them anexample of coolness that could not be unprofit¬able to those who followed.But the finest illustration of their conduct,was displayed in that of their chief, whoseability and invincible presence of mind, underthe complicated responsibility and anxiety ofa commartder, husband, and father, Were emi¬nently calculated, throughput the dismal day,to infepirb all with Obmposure and fortitude.Never for a moment did Colonel Fearon seeirito forg-et the authority with which hisSovereign had invested him, nor did any ofhis officers—as far as my observation went—cease to remember the relative situations inwhich they were severally placed. Even inthe gloomiest moments of that dark season,when the dissol ' '' rthly dis¬and confidence with which orders were issuedon the one hand, and the promptitude and re¬spect with which they were obeyed on theother, afford the best proofs of the stabilityof the well connected system of disciplineestablished in the 31st ragiment,—and themost unquestionable ground for the high andflattering commendations which his RoyalHighness the Commander-in-Chief has beenpleased to bestow upon it.As an agreeable proof too, of the subordina¬tion and good feeling that governed the poorsoldiers in the midst of their suffering, I oughtto state, that towards evening when themelancholy groups wffio were passively seatedon the poop, exhaused by previous fatigue,anxiety and fasting, were beginning to ex¬perience the pain of intolerable thirst, a boxof oranges was accidently discovered by someof the men, who with a degree qf mingledconsideration, respect, and affection, that couldhardly have been expected at such a moment,refused to partake of the grateful beverageUntil they had offered a share of it to theirofficers.c Some of the soldiers near me having casuallytinction seemeddecision17remarked that the sun was setting, I lookedround, and never can I forget the intensitywith which I regarded his declining rays. Ihad previously felt deeply impressed with theconviction that night the ocean was to be mybed; and had, I imagined, sufficiently realizedmy “ mind, both to the last struggles and theconsequences of death.Some time after the shades of night hadenveloped us, I descended to the cuddy, inquest of a blanket to shelter me from theincreasing cold; and the scene of desolationwhich here presented itself was melancholyin the extreme. The place which, only a fewhours before, had been the seat of kindlyintercourse and social gaiety, was now' entirelydeserted, save by a few miserable wretches,who were either stretched in irrecoverableintoxication on the floor, or prowling about,like beasts of prey, in search of plunder.The sofas, drawers, and other articles offurniture, the due arrangement of which hadcost so much thought and pain, were nowbroken into a thousand pieces, and scatteredin confusion around me, some of the geese andother poultry escaped from their confinementwere cackling about in the cuddy ; while asolitary pig, wandering from its stye in theforecastle, was ranging at large in the undis¬turbed possession of the Brussels carpet thatcovered one of the cabins. Glad to retire froma scene so cheerless and affecting, and render¬ed more dismal by the smoke that was oozingtip from below, 1 returned to the poop where1 again found Capt. Cobb, Colonel Fearon,18and the few officers that remained, superin¬tending, with unabated zeal, the removal otthe rapidly diminishing sufferers, as the boatssuccessively arrived to carry them off.As the boats were nearly three quarters ofan hour absent between each trip, whichperiod was necessarily spent by those in thewreck in a state of fearful inactivity, abundantopportunity was afforded for collecting thesentiments of many of the unhappy menaround me, some of whom, after remainingperhaps for a while in silent abstraction, wouldsuddenly burst forth as if awakened from someterrible dream to a still more frightful realityinto a long train of loud despond mg lamenta¬tion, that gradually subsided into its formerstillness. „ , .But it was not till the close of tins mourn¬ful tragedy that backwardness, rather thanimpatience, to adopt the perilous and onlymeans of escape that offered, became gener¬ally discernable on the part ot the unhappyremnant still on board; and that it made itnot only imperative on Captain Cobb to re¬iterate his threats as well as his entreaties thatnot an instant should be lost, but seemed torender it expedient for one of the officers otthe troops to express his intention of remain^ing to the last, to limit, in the hearing otthose around him the period of his own stay.Captain Cobb, in his immoveable resolutionto be the last if possible, to quit his ship, andiu his generous anxiety for the preservationof every life entrusted to his charge, refusedto seek'the boat, until he again endeavoured/19to ur^ e those around him, who seemed struckdumb and powerless with dismay. But find¬ing all his entreaties fruitless, and hearing theguns whose tackle was burst asunder by the ad¬vancing flames, successively exploding in thehold in which they had fallen, this gallantofficer, after having nobly pursued, for thepreservation of others, a course of exertionthat has been rarely equalled either in its du¬ration or difficulty, at last felt it right to pro¬vide for his own safety, by laying hold on thetopping-lift, or rope that connects the driverboom with the mizen-top, and thereby gettingover the heads of the infatuated men who oc¬cupied the boom, unable to go either back¬ward or forward, and ultimately droppinghimself into the water.The means of escape, however, did notcease to he presented to the unfortunate indi¬viduals above referred to long after CaptainCobb took his departure,-^—since one of theboats persevered in keeping its station underthe Kent’s stern, not only after all expostu¬lation and entreaty with those on board hadfailed, but until tbe flames, bursting forthfrom the cabin windows, rendered it impossi¬ble to remain, without inflicting the greatestcruelty on the individuals that manned it.Quitting for a moment, the subject of thewreck, I would advert to what was in themeatirne taking place on board the Cambria.I cannot, however, pretend to give you anadequate idea of the feeling of hope or dis-pair, that alternately flowed, like a tide, inthe breasts of the unhappy females on boardthe brig, during the hours of torturing sus¬pense in which many of them were unavoid¬ably held, respecting the fate of their hus¬bands ;--feelings which were inconceivablyexcited, rather thafi soothed, by the idle anderroneous rumours occasionally conveyed tothem, regarding the state of the Kent. Butstill less can I pourtray the alternate picturesof awfnl joy, and of wild distraction, exhibitedby the sufferers, (for both parties for the mo¬ment seemed equally to suffer,) as the ter¬rible truth was communicated, that they andtheir children were indeed left husbandlessand fatherless; or as the objects from whomthey had feared they were for ever severed,suddenly rushed into their arms.But these feelings of delight, whatevermay have been their intensity, were speedily•Jiastened, and the attention of all arrested,by the last tremendous spectacle of destruc¬tion.After the arrival of the last boat the flameswhich had spread along the upper deck andpoop, ascended with the rapidity of lightningto the masts and rigging, forming one generalconflagration, that illumined the heavens toan immense distance and was strongly re¬flected on several objects on board the brig.At last abont half-past one o’clock in themorning, the devouring element havingcommunicated to the magazine, the longthreatened explosion was seen, and the blazingfragments of the once magnificent Kent wereinstantly hurried, like so many rockets, highinto the air.BREADFUL SUFFERINGSopSJX DESERTERS from ST. HELENA,IN A WHALE BOAT.On December 12, 1799, a court of enquirywas held at St. Helena, before Captain Des-fontaine, president, Lieut. B. Hodson, andEnsign Young, when the following extraor¬dinary and affecting narrative of the suffer¬ings of six deserters from the artillery of theIsland of St. Helena, was made to them onoath, by John Brown, one of the survivors :—In June, ITOQ, I belonged to the first com¬pany of artillery, in this garison, and, on the10th of that month, about half an hour beforeparade time, M'Kinnon, gunner and orderlyof the second company, asked me if I waswilling to go with him on hoard of an Ameri¬can ship, called the Columbia, Captain HenryLelar, the only ship then in the roads. Aftersome conversation I agreed, and met him,about seven o'clock, at the play-house, whereI found one M‘Quin, of Major Seale’s com¬pany, another man, called Brighouse, anothernamed Parr, and a sixth, Matthew Conway.Parr was a good seaman, and said he wouldtake us to the island of Ascension, or lie offthe harbour till the Columbia could weighanchor and come out. We went down abouteight o’clock to the West Rock, where theAmerican boat, manned with three seamen,was watting for us, and took us alongsidehe Columbia. We went on board.22Brighouse and Conway proposed to cut awhale-boat out of the harbour, to preventthe Columbia from being suspected.We observed lanterns passing on the linetowards the Sea-gate, and hearing a npise,thought we were missed and sought far us.We immediately embarked in the whale-boatwith about twenty-five pounds of bread in abag, and a small keg of water.We then left the ship, pulling with two oarsonly, to get ahead of her. The boat was halffull of water, and we had nothing to bale ttout. In this condition we rode out to sea,and lay off the island at a great distance, inhourly expectation of the American ship tak-mar us up. it\ bout twelve o’clock the second day, noship appearing, by Parr’s advice we bore awaysteering N. by W. and then N.N.W for theisland of Ascension, using onr handkerchiefsas substitutes or sails. We met with a galeof wind, which continued two days: toeweather then became very fine and we supposewe had run about ten miles an hour MKinnon kept a reckoning with pen, ink, andpaper, with which, together with maps andcharts, we were supplied by the Columbia.We continued our course till about the 18thin the morning, when we saw a number oibirds, hut no land. About twelve that day,Parr said he was sure we must be past theisland, accounting it to be eight hundred milesfront St Helena.On the 25th all our provisions were expend¬ed On the 27 th M'Quin put o piece ofbamboo in his mouth to chew, and we all23followed his example. On the night of thatday it was my turn to steer the boat, andrecollecting to have read of persons in oursituation eating their shoes, 1 cut a peace offone of mine ; but being soaked with salt waterI was obliged to spit it out, and take the insidesole, of which I ate a part, and distributed theaemainder to the rest; but we found npbeneifit fram itOn the 1st of July Parr caught a dolphin,with a gaff that had been left In the boat. Weall fell on onr knees, and thanked G od forhis goodness to us. We tore up the fish, andhung it to di*y ; about four we ate part of itwhich agreed with us pretty well. On thisfish we subsisted till the 4th ; about eleven o’clock, when finding the whole consumed, ParrBrighouse, Conway, and myself, proposed toscuttle the boat, and let her go down, to pntus out of out of you misery.On the 5th, about eleven, M'Kinnon pro¬posed that it would be better to cast lotstor one of us to die, in order to save the restto which we consented. WJlliam Parr, beingseized two days before with the spotted feverwas excluded. He rote the numbers* andput them into a hat. We drew them outblindfolded, and put them in our pockets.Parr then asked whose lot it was to die;none of us knowing what number w e had inonr pocket, it was agreed that number fivesbonld die, and the lots being unfolded, M‘Kinnon’s was the fetal number.We had concluded that he on whom the lotfell should bleed himself to death, for whichpurpose we had provided ourselves withHsharpened nails, which we got from the boat.With one of these M'Kinnon cut himself inthree parts; in his foot, hand, and wrist;and praying to God to forgive his sins, hedied in about a quarter of an hour.Before he was quite cold, Brighouse, withone of the nails, cut a piece of tiesh off histhigh, and hung it up, leaving his body inthe boat. About three hours afterwards weall ate of it, but only in a very small quantity.We dipped the body every two hours in thesea to preserve it. Parr having found a pieceof slate in the bottom of the boat, he sharpen¬ed it on the large stone, and with it cut ano¬ther piece off the thigh, which lasted us tillthe 8th; when it being the watch, and ob¬serving the water, about break of day, tochange colour, I called the rest, thinking thatwe were near the shore, but saw no land, itbeing not quite daylight. As soon as dayappeared, we saw land right a-head, andsteered towards it. About eight in the mo -ning we were close to the shore. Therebeing a heavy surf, we endeavoured to turnthe boat’s head to it., but, being very weak,we were unable. Soon afterwards the boatupset. Parr. Conway, and myself got onshore, hut M'Wimi and Brighouse weredrowned. We discovered some Indians, whotook us to the governor’s house, who gaveus a bed and miik and rice to eat. Weremained at Si Salvador about thirteen days,during which dme the inhabitants made up asubscription of £i!0'J each man. We thenembarked in the Maria, a Portuguese ship,for Lisbon.THE END.

Joe,Hove the anchor-a-peak, singing yoe, heave, yoe !To hand top-gallant sails next he learn’d,VVith quickness, care, and spirit,Whose gen’rous master then discern’d.And priz’d his downing merit:He taught him soon to reef and steer.When storms convuls'd the ocean.Where shoals made skilful Vet’rans fear,Which mark’d him for promotion;As none to the pilot e’er answer’d like he.When he gave the command. Hard a-port! helm a-lee!Luff, boys, luff! keep her near!Clear the buoy, make the pier !Kone to the pilot e’er answer’d like he.When he gave the command, in the pooVot at sea;. Hard a-port!,helm a-lee !For valour, skill, and worth renown’d.The foe he oft defeated jAnd now, with fame arrd fortune crown’d.Post Captain he is rated;Who, should our injur’d country bleed,Still bravely would defend her ;Now blest with peace, if beauty plead,"He’ll prove, his heart as tender.Unaw’d, yet mild to high andJow,To poor and wealthy, friend or foe;Wounded tars share his wealth,—All the fleet drink his health—Priz’d be such hearts, for aloft they will go.Which always are ready compasfciOn to shewTo a brave conquer'd foe.FJNJS.

;Transfixed before the joint he stood,The sight of which might have done goodTo any hungry glutton.For such a Leg at any door,The Elder never saw before,A better or a fatter ;The Mutton had been rightly fed,If caused with streaks of white and red,His very mouth to water.This man of spiritual elevation,Found in his heart a strong temptation,To put it in his paws ;And take the Leg home to his dinner,Kor let it fall to any sinnerTo grease theingraceless jaws.OF SCOTLAND r )4For he’d listen’d to the weekly prayings.And much admired his pastor’s sayings,W herein it was set forth ;That pease-meal brose were very goodTo feed the swinish multitude,Those souls of little worth.For worthy things unto the dogs,And Legs of M utton unto hogs,Should not be gi’en at all jSo to secure and end the matter,And get the joint for his own platter.To the owner he did call:—“ Your Mutton’s price, come tell me brief,”‘‘ Three Shillings,” cried the man of beef,“ The best I’ll swear in town ?”With some few prigging words at last,The Elder struck a bargain fast.To pay but half-a-crown.The price being’Settled, honest ,Did rumble thro’ his pouch for siiiar.Then to the Flesher said ;“ My pocket-book 1 have lorgot,“ Wherein was safely laid a note,“ From which you should be paid.”The merchant cried, “ there’s little danger,You are a decent looking stranger,“ We’ll trust you for the same j“ But lest the Mutton, when you’ve eat,“ Xo pay the same you should forget,“ I’d thank you tor your name.”To save his purse, a poor half-crown, —’s name he did write down• And gave it for his own.With Leg of Mutton an his back,He justified this worthy act,As he limped westward home.“ Since by the laws of ordination“ I have been thrown into temptation,“ The fault could not be mine ;“ For w'hat was doom’d before creation“ Will little touch my own salvation,“ Or yet be deem’d a crime.“ But what are moral actions worth,“Compared with faith in myst’rous truth,“ Which fully I inherit ?“ Thro’ strength of faith in the elected,“ Our little faults are all neglected,“ On faith we ground our merit.”On this matter then no more he thought.But the Mutton Leg to broughtAnd quickly did devour.Such a most glorious recreationStrengthen’d his strokes of degradationOn those within his power.6For he was of that worthy raceWho darkness from bur country chase.And ways to knowledge teach :lie pow’rfully did enforce his laws,With hearty thwacks of leather taws.On each poor culprit’s breechBy dint of practice and reflection,He had found out a strong connectionWhich nat’rally existed ;For honour’s seat he did reflectThe door was to the intellect,To gain each point insisted.And each poor dog who could not bringAt Candlemas some dainty thing,He’d set upon a stool,This practice good he never miss’d,But kept them there till they were hiss’dBy all the rest in school.And constant did the Dominie,With clenchy foot and bowly knee,Still follow up tins plan—And taught, moreover, by the rod.The duties that were due to God,And how to walk with man.Meantime, the man in townBegan to think that his haif crownWas totally forgot yn/Being deeply struck with this rcflectipn,.To the person nam’d in the directionA letter straight he wrote.The answer he got to his letterThrew some small light upon the matter,And strengthen’d all his fears.The flesher’s case the man much did pity.But declared he’d not been in the cityTor more than nine full years.The Butcher after chanced to beIn , and resolved was he,To find the Pedagogue ;He straightway to the man repaired,But whose appearance soon declaredThat he was not the rogue.Tho’ the just man of worthy piety,The ornament of good society,Who gave the false direction ;Thought still that by that line.Would pay the Leg of Mutton fine,A noble good reflection.Howe’er, from what the Tlesher said,A thought came into ’s head,Of whom the man might be ;They both to ’s school • iitl go,For in their hearts they longed to knowThe upshot of the spree.8The teacher’s vsg-e was somewhat dunted.To find himself thus so confronted,Jiy those he would have cheated jThe’ he was bowly 1 egg’d and fat,He looked on ihis, side, then on that.And fain would have escaped.Convinced from what he heard and saw, -That ’twould be vain for to withdrawVv'iihout paying down the sillar ?For the Butcher with a voice of thunder, >Cried, “ in your line there is a blunder,“ instead of !!!”He from his pocket in a thrice,Pull’d out the Leg of Mutton’s price,’“ I have no time to stay ;“ There, take your money and begone,“ You greasy son of flesh and bone,”He cried, and limpt away.Let Fleshers then take care.Lest they he brought unto the fairBy this worthy man of merit}Who for the sake of one half crown,The rights of Honour would lay downWith such becoming spirit.MODERN IDOLATRY.They provoked him to jealonsy w:th strange gods, with «ba-rninations prov- ked they liinn to anger.The vicar of Bray will be vicar of Bray stil. Paorxnn.I fain' would rehearse in a fe^ lines ofverse,The deeds of a good pious man ;‘Mongst our Pastor’s transactions there’ssome worthy actions.Part of which we at present will scan.He is pious and holy, a foe to all folly,To talk things immodest or rude :And by night and by day he would fervent¬ly pray,That Satan be fairly subdued.This Preacher so good at the back windowstood, ' ;When a being tript by like a Genie ;He thought ’twas Miss  , with herheathenish tricks,Hieing forth to the Fane of Cloacina*.* Cloacina, the name of the Deity who presides over Mor¬tals when incontinently aflected.10For daily this fair to her shrine did repair.To pay her unfeigned Devotions;But the Minister sage, waxed hot in a rage,As he look’d on her Paganish motions.Glow’d his heart with the fire: of a holydesire,So he after her straight did repair,To drag from the shrine of this ancientdivineA maid so accomplished and fair.He sware by the ; that such thingswere hostileTo nature, to custom, and order ;To see a maiden so tine attend at the shrine.His feelings threw into disorder.He with worthy intent, to the temple doorwent,There knock’d till the fabric did nod ;Tho’ the lady resisted, he on entrance in¬sisted.Like a praise-worthy servant of .But the man of the pulpit did mistake hisculprit,Altho’ bent to root out superstition :When the door open dew, it exposed tohis viewA Matron in bended ■position /11For the girl and her mother it seems bothtogether,The same superstition did follow ;And they went every day their devotionsto pay,Midst fumes of sweet-smelling savour.This act of our Patron enraged the matron.For the deed he had often repeated:He would look through and pry^ with in¬quisitive eye,While -they at their worship were seated.She exclaim’d, “ Mr. , more respectto the ladies,Is due from a man in your station ;Such an action, I’m sure, would e’en by aw—e,Be look’d on with great indignation.More immodest, I’m sure, at this presenthourAre not under the hands of a jailor ;I swear you inherit not half of the spiritOf your old buckrum father the Tailor.I ne’er would have thought that a man ofyour coat,With so much appearance of goodness $ISWould Imv.e descended so low, as to trou¬ble us so,An unmannerly instance of rudeness.That such meanness should lurch, at thehead of the church.As a Temple to try to force open ;"When seated at prayer anyfetnale was there.Persecution doth surely betoken.Such closehooded saints, religion but taints.Pretenders to penance and woe;If you lift up the cloak, the deception isbroke,There’s a Hypocrite lurking below.So my friends I advise you, if e’er he sur¬prise youWith his meanness, and want of discre¬tion,Turn your face from the door, and bespat¬ter him o’er,With part of the Golden Oblation.THELEARNED DOMINIE.Gratis anhelans, multa agendo nihil agens.—Phaedr.Out of breath to no purpose, aud very busy about nothing.(COPY.)Messrs ■Dear Sir !The following remarks youll pleasearrange agreeably to your own mind after read¬ing the whole Process /am much hurt at the foulaspersions against my Character as a Teacher af¬ter having taught upwards of Twenty years inthis place it is the first of the kind I ever metwith /appeal Vothrce of the present HonM0 Magis¬trates namely Baillie R M'Lean whose Family /taught and / hope to his satisfaction Baillie Car-s'wells Rider namely Mr Thomas Wylde who recdhis (wholeJ Education at my School BaillieBuchanan who has the experience oj me Teachinghis Sisters Children 1 appeal not only to the Eastand West Tolls in Paisley but to all the differentSessions here who have employed me and fromsaid bodies I am still employed and to all themen of Character who ever employed me and whoare still employing me namely M^rch** Manr3 andhonest Mechanics / appeal to the Tamm of Ren¬frew and^ Inchinnan namely Provest HutchesonMessrs Kerr Davidson and others who sent their34Familys at such a distance several years to mySchool one of that number is still employing meand to the Parishes of Beilh Dunlop and Sfeviar-ton who employ me less or more every summer Iappeal to the Hector of the Grammar School here•w ho is in the practice of receiving some of myScholars into his Grammar School who is a fitjudge to asccrain my Character as a Teacher theboyrs who have gone to his School nearly thesetwenty years he will know how they pronounceknow the parts of speech and sounds of the vowelswhich is my habitual practice in Teaching myEnglish Scholars John Donald and his friendswell know the rapid progress his Daughter Iso-bella made from the Letters to read tolerable easyin the bible in less than nine months I rec1 latelya Certificate from one of the present MagistratesBaillie R.

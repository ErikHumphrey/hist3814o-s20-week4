Habbieappears to have been rather a privileged character,for besides being the best piper m the west country,he was possessed of many eccentricities, the oddityand originality of which always rendered him a wel¬come and amusing companion. That he was re¬garded as no common character may be inferred fromthe fact that a statue of him, pipes and all, waaerected in a prominent niche of the steeple of Kil-barchan, his native village, where it yet stands a veryaignificant testimony of the esteem in which he waaheld.]I pit nae doubt but ye've a’ heard tell o’ HabbieSimpson, the piper o’ Kilbarchan; but I’m no think-iag ye ever heard the story that I’m gaun to tell yeaboot him and his wife, Janet. Weel, ye see, it saehappened that Habbie, like mony mae now-a-daya,was geyan fond o’ a wee drap o’ the blue, and as thestory gangs, sae was his wife, so that it geyan oftenhappened that when Habbie yokit the fuddle, Janet■he yokit it tae. Noo, it’s an auld saying, and aKyan true ane, tae, that when a cannel is lichtit at,ith ends, it sune burns dune, and it was sae veri¬fied in the present case; for Habbie waukened aemorning after a hard fuddle, and says to Janet—“ Rise, woman, and see if ye can get me half-a-gilLfor, on! my head is like to split.” “ Half-a-gill!’19quo* Janet, “ Whaur wad I get it when there’s BO •plack in the house ? and as for takin’nt on, ye kenthat’s clean ooto’ the question, so ye maun just lie stifland thole the best way ye can.” “ Oh, Janet,” crieaHabbie again, ‘‘ You’re no amiss at scheming—isthere nae way ava ye can think on to raise thewind !” “ I’ll tell ye what I’ll do,” quo’ Janet, “ I’llawa' to the Laird o’Johnstone, and I’ll tell him thatye’re deid, and as you’re a great favourite o’ his, I'msure I’ll get something frae him to help tae bury ye.**“ Od, but that will do grand,” quo’ Habbie. Sae upJanet gets and awa’ tae the laird’s house, when, ring¬ing the bell, the door was opened by the lady, who,seeing Janet so pitiful looking, she says—“ Keep usa’ this day, is there onything wrang at hame that yehae come here sae early in the morning ?” “ Wrang,”quo’ Janet, dichtin’ her een wi’ the tail o’ her apron,“ A’s wrang thegither, my leddy. Isna oor Habbiedeid!” “Habbie deid!” quo’ the lady in surprise.“ A-weel-wat is he, my leddy,” quo’ Janet, “ and a sailtrial it is to me, my leddy; for there’s no as mucklein the house, this morning, as would feed a sparrow;and whaur to get onything I’m sure I dinna ken.Oh, dear! oh, dear! that ever I should come to thiso’!” “ Compose yourself,” quo’ the leddy, “ Andoome your wa’s ben, and we’se see what can Do done.”Sae, in gangs Janet wi’ the lady, and gets a basketwi’ some biscuits and speerits, and ither articlesneedfu’ for sic an occasion; and thanking the ladyfor her kindness, comes awa’ hame to Habbie fu'blythely, when doon they sat, nor did they rise tillthey made an end o’ the contents o’ the basket.Noo, as the auld sang says, the mair ye drink thedrier ye turn, for they were nae sooner dune thanHabbie says—“ Losh, Janet, that’s real guid; can yeno get some mair o’t?” “Na, na,” quo’ Janet, “Ihae played my turn already; it’s your turn noo.”“ Oh, very weel,” quo’ Habbie, “ If it’s my turn noo,ye maun jist be deid next.” “ ’Ods, I ha’e nae ob¬jections,” quo’ she, “ sao awa’ ye gang, and let’s seewhat ye can do.” Wool, awa’ gangs Habbie, and20meeting the Laird jlst coming hame frae a huntingarty, he says—“ This is a fine day, laird.” “ A fineay, Habbie,” quo’ the laird; “ Hoo’s a’ wi’ ye 1 areye no coming up to play us a spring on the pipes thenicht ?” “ It wadna look very weel, laird, for me tobe playing on the pipes at your house, and my ainwife lying a corpse at hame.” “ What! is Janetdeid r quo’ the laird. “ Atweel is she,” quo’Habbie, “ And I’m sure it couldna ha’e happened ata waur time, for there’s neither meat nor siller inthe house, and hoo to get her decently aneath theyird, I’m sure I dinna ken.” “ Dinna vex yourselabout that,” quo’ the laird, gi’en him some money;‘'There’s a trifle for you.” Habbie thanked the lairdfor his kindness, bade him guid day, and cam hamegeyan weel pleased wi’ what he had gotten, andsends Janet oot wi’ the bottle to get mair whisky tocarry on the spree. In the meantime, hame gangsthe laird, whaur the first thing that he heard was,that Babbie Simpson was deid. “ Na, na,” quo’ he,“ It’s no Ilabbie, it’s only Janet.” “ It's Habbie,quo’ the lady; “ Wasna Janet here this morning her-sel and tell’t me ? and didna she get awa’ somespeerits and biscuits, as she said there was nothingin the house ?” “ And didna I meet Habbie just asI was coming hame, when he tell’t me that Janetwas deid. But I see hoo it is—they are at their auldtricks again. But come, we’ll awa’ to Habbie’s, andsee what they’re about.” In the meantime, Habbieand Janet are fuddlin’ in fine style, and lauchin’heartily at the way ta’en to raise the wind, whenJanet cries—“ Guid preserve us, Habbie, what’s tobe dune noo! I declare if that’s no the laird and theleddy, and they’re coming straucht here!” “I dinnaken, quo’ Habbie, “what to do unless we are baithdeid.” Sae in the bed they gaed, and they were naosooner doon, than the laird and lady cam in, andseeing Habbie and Janet in bed, he says—“ Waesme! isna that awfu’ to see 1 The man and wife baithdeid! But I’d gi’e five shillings this moment to kenwhich o’ the twa dee’t first.” The words were nae21i«ooner out o’ his mouth than up jumps Ilabbie, aj*ing—“It was me, laird; noo gie me the five shil¬lings.” It is needless to add that the laird giedHabbie the money, and mony a hearty laugh he hadwhen he thought on the way Habbie and his wiiihad ta’en to Raise the Wind.THE WEST KINTRAWeaver Turned Teetotaler.[This celebrated Scottish story used to bo told byl the late John Drummond, with tremendous applause!]It’s as fack as death, I’m maist burning wi’ shamei| to baud up my head before sic a respectable company,| particularly as my character, drawn in gey blackI colours, has been here before me; but as ye hasheard the first o’t, and I hope the warst o’t, I trustthat ye’ll pay attention to what remains o’ my his¬tory, and ye’ll be better able to judge o’ the storrthrough and through.

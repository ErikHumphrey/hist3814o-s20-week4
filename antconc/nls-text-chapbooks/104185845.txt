the varying feafons hadTo ev’ry hardfliip form’d his frame.;Tho’ ftill his tender feeling heart,By nature nurs’d, remain’d the fame.( 3 ')'VI.But whither ftiall the orphan fly; To meet protection's foftering power?Oppreflion waits the future day,When mifery marks the natal hour.vn.An orphan lad poor Lubin was.No friend, no relative had he!His happiefl hour was dalh’d with wo,His mildeft treatment—tyranny.VIII.It chanc’d that o’er the boundlefs heathOne winter’s day his flocks had fpread;By hunger urg’d to feek the blade,That lurk’d beneath its fnowy bed.IX.And, hous’d at eve, his fleecy charge,He, forrowing, mifs'd a favourite lamb,That fliunn’d the long perfifting fearch.Nor anfwer’d to its bleeting dam.X.With heavy heart he (hap’d his way,And told fo true, fo fad a tale,That almolt pierc’d the marble breaftOf ruthlefs Rufus of the vale.XI.Poor Lubin own’d his flocks had ftray’d,Own’d he had fuffer’d them to go;Yes !—he had learn’d to pity them,For often he had hunger’d too:( 4 )Xff.And had he to their pinching wants,The unnipp’d neighb'i ing bounds deny’d;They fure had dropp’d—as furely too,The pitying fhepherd boy had died.XIII.Then die!—th’ unfeeling mailer faid,Andfpurn’d him from his doling door;Which, till he found his favourite lamb.He vow’d Ihould ne’er admit him more.XIV.Dark was the night, and o’er the wafteThe whiftling winds did fiercely blow.And ’gainft his poor unlhelter’d head,With arrowy keennefs came the fnow:XV.The fmall thick fnow that Eurus drivesIn freezing fury o’er the plain.And with uniparing vengeance, feoresThe callous face of hardielt fvvain.XVI.Vet thus he left his mailer’s houfe,And fliap’d his fad uncertain way;By man unnotie’d and forfook,And follow’d but by—trully Tray—XVII.Poor trully Tray!

There¬fore we have furnished the public with a smallcollection of old wives' noted sayings and wots-ders, which they relate happened in their owntame, also what has been told them by theirforefathers.Two old wives, Maggy and Janetj at theirrocks, began their cracks as follows:Janet. A dear Maggy, and how auld wSlye be now, o’ it's lang since I kind you.Maggy. Indeed, Janet, that's what naebo-dy kens, for my father and mither had saetnony o' us, they ne'er counted how auldafie o‘ us was, they minded aye wha o' u*was born first, and wba was neist ane auithea,and that was a' that e'er we sought to ke«rsdjout it, but I hae mind o' the uiirk Mua-onday.Jan. Hq«|*ri-i.3nonclay, I hae mind since there was naeMunnondays at a", an the Sabbath days wasnae corn’d in fashion, there was a day theyca’d Sunday came anes o’ the ouk for it, wekend ay when it came, for my father cow’day his beard when the bell rang, and thenevery body ran to the kirk it had ony thingado, an it were to buy saut or shune, forthe chapman cheils set up a’ their creims atthe kirk-door, an the lasses wad a gottenkeeking glasses, red snudes, needles, preens,elshin-irons, gemlets, brown bread and blacksaep to buy, forby sweety-wives’ things, andBattlers for restless little-anes ; the men wada bought pints o’ ale, an a gotten a whangof good cheese to chow a’ the time a drink¬ing o’t, hout, tout ay, they were braw marketson the Sundays x’ the time of Paepery, wehad nae ministers then but priests. MessJohns, Black Friers, and White Friers,Monks, Abbots and Bishops, they had naewives, yet the best o’ them wad a spoken,baudy language, and a kiss’d the lasses, fic¬kle tyking bodies they were, unco ill toplease, they wad a baith curs'd fouk apdbless’d them, just as he pay’d them ; a deedthey were unco greedy o’ the penny,' andS’d ay to the dead fouk, and gard the» pay them for’t, and altho’ they badplay'd, the loon wi’ a poor hizey she durst naspeak o’t for her very life, for they cou’d gi’ony body o’er to the de’il when they liket:They did not gar fouks learn to read, and4pray like our new ministers, but thump onyour breast, strake your fingers o’er aboonyour nose, tell your beeds, and rin bare-fitthro’ amang hard stanes, and cauld sna\Mag. A heeh woman, an wad they a had jcarnal dealings wi1 the women, and them saegood and haly.dan. Hout ye daft woman', do you thinkthat their gudeness gelded them the’ they hadnae wives; there was a great sort o’ themit they ca’d cardonels, that ay when twayoung bodies was married they bute to hae jthe first night o’ the bride.Mag. A wae worth them filthy hurertigdogs, if T widnaa libbet them mysel, I won-der that the gentle fouks and lairds lote themdo the like o’ that.Jan. A deer woman, the gentle foaks iand the lairds keepit ay in wi’ them, for theysaid they had the command o’ the de’il andthe dead fouk, and the gentles durst na castout wi’ them, for they got a’ their sins par>doo’d for the less siller. vMag. A dear woman that was unco like,tire de’il wad get nae body then but the popr |foul, and them that had nae siller;Jan. A well a wat that was true, for antSiey paid tke priest well, the de’il durst namiddle wi’ them.Mag. A wow woman an what's cote©! o’them a’ now, and sure the like o* thafe foufcsit had sae meikle power, needed net tires diesor yet be sick; they wad life a’ their days..':||:rjan. A wat well did they, for the maisto’ them is dead and rotten, and the rest o’them gadc awa to Italy, where the an Id Tapetheir father, the de‘il, the witches, browniesand faries dwal; and then we got anithersort*o‘gospel foitks, it they caed c'urits, finesort o‘ dainty honest fouks they war, but gayand greedy, they did not like sculduddery-wark, but said na meikle against it, for ahantle oJ bits a callens wad a gotten twa orthree bastards before they wad a gottenbreeks; they bcit to hae their tithes of everything-that grew, mony a time my father wist,they wad tak the tithes o‘ his hemp too, anit were to hang themsels, they were ay warstwhare a poor man or wife died, altho‘ theyleft weans fatherless and mitherless, a deedthey wad a sent their bellman, and wi‘ hislang prelatic fingers he wad a harl‘d theupper pair o‘ blankets aff a‘ the poor things’bed, for some rent that they gard fouks payfor dying, a sae did they ecn, and yet theykeepit a hantle o‘ braw • haiy days, and dayso{ meikle meat, Fasterncs-een and' Yule-days,when wre got our wames fou o‘ fat-brose, anda suppet Yule sowens till our sarks had beenlike to rive, and after that a eaten rostedcheese and white puddings well spiced, Obraw times for the guts, well I wat everybody might live then that had ony thijjg tolive on.Mag. But dear Janet yefre bra4 an lango4 the memory, do ye mind o4 the waefu4—i.6blast, when the foul thief was raging in theair, and the de’il dang down a’ the kail yarddykes, cutted ihe corn stacks, tirr’d the hou¬ses, and blew giddy Willy’s wig in the wall,they said it was some young minister it hadrais’d the de’il, and for want o’ a cock, acat, or some unkirsen’d creature to gi’e him,they could na’ get him laid again, and hebrake the bridle, slipped his head, and ranawa frae them.Jan. A deed woman I heard tell o’ that,and how woud Willie M‘Neel met him onthe steps in the mids o’ the water, and shothim o’er, and thought to drown him, butlie gade down the water like a ireikle brand¬ed bill roaring, a’ burning fire ; but I haemind the first time it the de’il came to thiskintrey was on a Sunday, I was a wi’ bitgaun lassie, my father an a1 the men foukw'as at the kirk, the ware twa o’ them, ahummel’d ane an a horn’d ane, a goodmande’il, and a goodwife de’il, as we took themto be, we ran a’ into the house, and mymither barr’d the door, and hunted the dogsout at the byre hole, thinking the de’il wadrin frae the dogs, but, na, na, they got upon their tae end like twa auld men, theywere a’ rugh lang hair like a pyet horse, wi’lang beards aneath their chin, and the mei-kle horn’d de’il box’d the dogs in at the holeagain, we ran a’ ben the house and grat, butoUr Jock wha was a little gabby gaun. lad-dock, cry’d ay, mither, mither, what is the47<3e'il seeking here, he’ll be wanting to tak a’the auld wives and cats to mak witches o’them; I true when ray grandmitlrer heardthat, she gat up and ran ben to the spenceand crap in the bear-meal barrel to hide her-sel frae the de’il, and curr’d there till thekirk skail’d, a deed she was sae fear’d, shemad?! her burn in the barrel : and what was’ttrue ye after a’, but a tupe a and ewe of thehighland gaits, it the laird had gotten to giethe lady milk, but mony a day we leugh atthe twa de’ils.Mag. But dear woman, what an a bodyis that de’il it ev’ry body is sae fear’d forhim, it’s na him they ca’ Auld Nick, whatfore do they ca1 him Auld Nick ?Jan. A deed woman I dinna ken whatlike o’ body he is, but they say he’s a’ black,and they ca’ him Auld Nick, because he’saulder nor Adam, and Adam was the firstman in the warld, and they say the de’ilwill never die, nor yet be sick, nor yet taksair een.Mag. . A wrow Janet but ye’re a wittycreature, but can ye tell me what way theblackamoors is made, some fouk says they’rea’ dipped in cats blood and burnt bear-strae,but I’m ay thinking the litster douks themin amang the broe that they lit the blackclaith wi’, and then sells them to the lairdsand gentle fouks to flee their bairns wi’, ordis the gentle fouks eat them when they’redead think yc.'8Jan. Hout awa daft creature, the black-amoors is fouk just like oursel, but only theyhae a black skin on them, did ye never seeblack sheep and white sheep, black horse andwhite horse, ye think they‘re a‘ de‘ils be¬cause the de‘il‘s black: I thought mysel lang-syne they were made for the penny, and 1selbd the dearer oc the black skin. 'Mag. But Janet did ye e‘er see the de‘il, |I wrad fain ken what like he is, some says he‘slike a bill, a bear, or an auld beggar man.Jan. Indeed I never saw sae rnuckle asthe de‘il a‘ my days, but I‘ve heard the mi- |nisters dyting and misca'ing him, and whanthey said a‘ that they cou‘d say o‘ him, they€a‘d him an ill spirit, and a great liar, monya ane has War names than a-‘ that yet.Mag. But do ye think there are ony de‘ilsbut ane, every body speaking and crying tohim, ane coudna answer them a‘.Jan. A deed they say, there's black anesand white anes o‘ them, hummel anes andhorn'd anes, the very witches is haf de'ils whan-they're living, and hail de'ils whan * they‘redead; the brownies is half dogs haf de'ils, a'rugh but the mouth, seeks nae claise, aeman's meat ‘ill sair them, and they'll workten men's wark in ae night, forby hobrgob-. lins, faries and elfs, that shoots fouks' beasts-to dead, and no a hole to be seen in the skino' them ; hardna ye tell o' the twa highlandwives, how the tane cry'd, Oh on, oh on,Shenet, my cow's shot; Houp, houp, co' she,4mumm9;*n wha snot her! A deed it was the de‘ilOh hoch, dh hoch, Shenet, we‘ll a‘ be kill'dwhan the de'il has gotten a gun.Mag A sweet na wi‘ us woman, is nit anunco thing they dinna a‘ flee on the ministerand worry him, when he flytes and mis»a*sthem sae, do ye think they hear him ?Jan. A doubtless they baith hear and seestoo, they're neither blind nor bleer-eyed, butay whan ye speak o‘ them, name the day, cryits Wansday thro' a'* the warld, and there'snae fear o' you.Mag. But what do you think o' our mini¬ster, is a good man think ye ?Jan. Indeed I think he's a gay gabby bo¬dy, but he has twa fauts, and his wife hasthree, he's unco greedy o' siller, an he's aypreaching down pride and up charity, an yethe's that fou o' pride himsel, that he has got¬ten a glass window on every side o' his nose,and his een is as clear as twa clocks to luckto, he has twa giglet gilliegawkies o' doch-ters, comes into the kirk wi‘ their coblete-how mutches frizl'd up as braid's their hips,an clear things lik,e stai ns about their necks,and at every lug, a walloping white tilinghanging like a snotter at a bubly weano nose,syne about their necks, a bit thin claith likea mouse web, and their twa bits o' paps play-ing ay niddity nod, shining thro' it like twayearning-bags; shame fa' them and their flig-mageries baith, for I get nae good o' thepreaching looking at them; and syne a' the10dirfy sherney-hought hizzies i’ the parish maunhae the like or lang gae; but an I ware topreach, sic pride soudna hae baith peace anproperty in my parish, I wou’d point out myvery finger to them in the kirk, and namethem baith name an surname, and say, Theresits sherney Meg o’ the Mill, stumpy May o’the Moss, sniveling Kate wi’ her hodle ma-kenster coat, they come into the kirk bob¬bing their bin-quarters like three water-wag¬tails, shaking- their heads like a hunder pundhorse, smacking their lips and handing theirmouth like May-paddocks; and what shall Icompare them to, but painted Jezebels; thewhore of Babylon, or Bachel the harlot, wi’a1 their gaudy decoying colours, high tapsand spread glittering tails, when they comesailing into the house o’ prayer, as it were ahouse o’ dancing and debaushery : Go, go, yepainted pisewips to fairs and weddings, andthere display your proud banners of pride,which you are puffed up with, it is the veryspirit o’ the devil, and unbecomming o’ thehouse o’ prayer : But if these gilly gaukiesshou’d come into the kirk wi‘ their heels upand their heads down, our Mess John is be¬come like ane o‘ the dogs of Egypt, he‘ll nomove his tongue, and I believe he darena forClippock his wife; wha's element is to ban¬ter a‘ the poor beggars frae her door, nanecan stand her but the tinkler-wives, and she*say whinging about charity, but it‘s to hersel,she wadna pity the criple on the blind's back.IIbut bids gae bame to their ain palish, fi^hvbeggar dirt; she casts a‘ her cauld paritchand kail to the cocks and hens, kicks thecolley dogs out o£ the door, cafs them filthy-useless brutes, because they canna lay eggs,like hen‘s eggs, she's ay flyting on her lasses,hungers her servant lad, eats docks' and hepshersel, and gars the poor minister eat sautherrin.Mag. A wcel I wat then I wish be inaynaturn a drucken body, for herrin rnaks foukay dry : But weel I wat Janet, ye hae tell‘dtheir fauts on baith the sides, an I hae aegreat faut to our minister yet, an tho' I weredead an rotten the night afore the morn, I‘11neither forgi'e him nor yet forget him, a whathe said o‘ me, that I sude be ta‘en *n douketfOr offerin to marry again, a women at myage; an auld man, said he, ought to manysome kindly body, to keep him clean in hisauld age ; but an auld woman, said he, thatcan wash a dud sark to themes, needs naemen : And now no Jnnci, I am no to ca* ve¬ry auld, altho‘ I be stricken in years, I din-na ken my am age, being kirsen'd in the timeo‘ Papery, I hae the penny, tho‘ bare o‘ fleshand blood, has four good teeth before, andwell willin gums in the backside, I cannagang far without a staff, an yet I wad as fainbe married as whan I was fifteen year auld.O woman ! but a man i‘ the bed is an usefu*body, they hae a sweet breath, and naturalheat to keep a body warm ; but an our mi-nister ^ere an auld wife, he wad ken whatthe want o£ a bit man is as weel as I. Anda* this began about Wanton Wat the town-taylor, that promised to tak me gin sic a time,or tell me what for; mony a.pickle well but-ter‘d kail-bleds I gied him, held out frae myain wame and $tappit in a his, he said he waddo as muckle to me again, but he has nadon't fause lown carle it he was, cheated meout o‘ sax pund and tw& sarks, and then gar'dme mak a fool o' mysel when the laird's duc¬ket was bigget, and made a' white to gar thedows come, he said, an my window war aswhite they w'ad come to me too, and T, likea poor fool, took a basin fu' o' good bear-meal, and made it drammock and whitepeda' my window’ wi't, but the never a dow camenear hand me the mair o't, but a' the towndogs came pycking an'l licking at it nightand day, I was plagued wi‘ them, till a gudeshoor came and washt it awa agcn, the lairdand every body came to look and laugh at it.Janet‘s advice to Maggy,ix>vicern\ng Marriage.While these two old Haveicls were thusdiscoursing together at their rocks, amongstother things, Maggy told Janet that altho' shewas now above a hundred years of age, shehad a great desire for a husband, but that shewould be obliged to use some methods andentisements to make the young men fall inlove vi' her. Upon whirl , 'Janet gave herthe following witty advice.«413Indeed, Maggy, an ye be a mind to marry,ye maun snod yoursel better up, cast awa yourstaff, singe your whiskers wi‘ a candle or fir-stick, stand straight up like a rash, kekle andlook canty-like whan carles is gawn by, taka mouthfu' o‘ good meat, and a drap dramic the mornin will keep the dirt aff your face,and raise the red in your cheek, ye see thehens turns ay red lugget or they begin to lay.A body that wants a bit man, maun use mo-ny a shift for ane, I ken how I did mysel,whan I was fourteen lang year a widow, anthought ne’er to gotten ane, I ficd our Johnwhen he was a saft silly dccus callan to ca’the pleugh, and keepit him three years tillhe. turn’d a wally wincer, and fain wad Ihad him, but he wadna speak o’t to me, butae day we ware in the bouse our lone, an Ities a glide hard stane-knot on the strings o’my toy beneath my chin, and fykes wit a-wee, then says, O Johnny, my man, look anye can louse this knot wi’ your teeth, he laysa hand on every" shoulder and louses the knot,an I grips him by the twa lugs, and gies hima kiss, and says, Poor man Johnny, thou hasa sweet breath, thou ncedna want a bit kisso’ me whan thou likes lad, I true that culli’dhim hither ay the mair, Ha, ha, thou hasnae art woman.Enters Humphray Clinker, hearing a’ thatpast,, persuades his aunt Maggy, that no manwould marry such as her, for she looked likea picture of death riding upon hunger’s back.Ha rickle of banes row'd up in a ruukly skin,bad wasted her body with water lythocks in¬to a scrufe of skin and bane, for want of teethto chow bread for the nourishment of herbody, and that he was corn'd on purpose toAvrite her testament or latter-wili, that it wasa lightness in her brain before death ; there-fore she ought to go to bed tmd die directly,which she accordingly did by taking thoughtof what was said unto her; the prieat beingsent for, came and discoursed frith her, butstill she keeping her purse in her hand, frhich.he observing, desired she would give it to herfriends or she died, to which she made ans-tver, by her sooth that she frad not, for shewad tak it wi‘ her, she had heard avery bo¬dy say, they were the better o‘ the penny wisthem gang whare they like, and so died, sup¬posed to be a hundred and six years old.An Oration on the Virtues of the OlbWomen, and the Pride of the Young.The madness of this unmuzzled age hasdriven me to mountains of thoughts,and a continual meditation; It is enough tomake an auid Avife rin redwood, and drive abody beyond the halter's end of ill-nature, tosee what I see, and hear Avbat I hear : There¬fore the hinges of my anger are broke, andthe bands of my good and mild nature arehurst in two, the door of civility is laid quiteopen, plain speech and mild admonition isV15of none effect; nothing must be used nowbut thunder-bolts of reproach tartly trimtn‘dup in a tantalizing style, roughly redd up andmanufactured thro£ an auld Matron‘s mouth,who is indeed but frail in the teeth, but willsqueeze surprizingly with her auld gums un¬til her very chaft-blades crack in the crush¬ing of your vice,I shall branch out my discourse into fourheads.First, What I haveseen, andbeen witness to.Secondly, What I now see, and am wit¬ness to.Thirdly, What I have heard, does hear,and cannot help; I mean the difference be-,tween the old women and the young.Fourthly, Conclude with an advice toyoung men and young women, how to avoidthe buying of Janet Juniper‘s stinking but¬ter*, which will have a rotten rift on theirstomach as long as they live.First, The first thing then, I see and ob¬serve is, That a wheen daft giddy-headed,cock-nosed, juniper-nebbed mothers, bringup a wheen sky-racket dancing daughters, acbred up to be ladies, without so much as thebreadth of their lufe of land, it's an admira¬tion to me, whare the lairds are a‘ to come* A nick-name to the wife’s daughter that no man willmarry because stuff’d full of laziness, self-conceit and stink-ing pride ; or if she be married she’ll lie like stinking bvt-j ter on his stomach while she lives.vk ■16frae that’s ta be coupled to them; work, na,r.a, my bairn maunna work, she’s to be a la¬dy, they ca’ her Miss; I maun hae her lugsbor’d, says auld Mumps the mither; thus thepoor pet is brought up like a mitherlesslamb, or a parrot in a cage; they learn nae-tbing but prick and sew, and fling their feetwhen the fiddle plays, so they become a par¬cel of yellow-faced female taylors, unequalmatches for country-men, Flandors-babbies,brought up in a box, and must be carried ina basket? knows nothing but pinching po¬verty, hunger and pride; can neither milkkye, muck a byre, card, spin, nor yet keepa cow from a corn-rigg; the most of suchare as blind penny-worths, as buying pigsin pocks, and ought only to be matched withTacket-makers, Tree-trimmers, and Male-taylors, that they may be male and female,agreeable in trade, since their piper-fac’d fin¬gers are not for heard labour ; yet they mightalso pass on a pinch for a black Sutor’s wife,for the stitching of white seams round themouth of a lady’s.shoe; or, with Barbers orBakers they might be buckled, because oftheir muslin-moiith and pinch-beck speeches,when barm is scant, they can blow up theirbread with fair wind, and when the razor isrough, can trim their cbafts with a fair -tale,oil their peruke with their white lips, andpowder the beau’s pow with a .French-puff;they are all versed in all the science of flat¬tery, musical-tunes, horn-pipes, and coun-*try-danC£s, though perfect in none but thereel of Gammon.Yet these are'they, the fickle farmer fixeshis fancy upon; a bundle of clouts, a skele¬ton of bones, Maggy and the Mutch,- liketwa fir-sticks and a pickle tow? neither forhis plate nor his plow; very unproper ple¬nishing, neither for her profit nor her plea¬sure, to plout her hands through Hawkey’scaff-cog, is’ a hateful hardship for Mammy’spet, and will hack a’ her hands. All this Ihave seen and heard, and been witness to;but my pen being a goose-quill, cannot ex¬pose their names nor place of abode, butwarns the working man out of the way.Secondly, I see another sort, who canwork, and maun work till they be married,and become mistresses themselves; but as theyoung man receives them, the thrift leavesthem; before that, they wrought as for awager, they span as for a premium, buskedas for a brag, scour’d their din skins as awauker does worsted blankets, kept as mintin the mouth as a minister’s wf£e, comely aDiana, chaste as Susanna, yet the whole oftheir toil is the trimming of their rigging,though their hubs be everlastingly in a leak¬ing condition; their back and their belliesare box'd about with the fins of a big fish,six petticoats, a gown and apron, besides aside sark down to the ancle-banes; ah ! whatmonstrous rags arc here, what a cloth isconsumed for a coven ng to one pair of but-18tocks! I leave it to the judgement of any tentaylors in town, if thirty pair of men’s breechesmay not be cut, from a little above the easingof Bessy’s bum, and this makes her a mother¬ly woman, as, stately a fabric as ever strade tomarket or mill.But when she’s married, she turns a ma¬dam, her mistress did not work much, andwhy should she ? Her mother tell'd ay shewad be a lady, but cou’d never show where.her lands lay; but when money is all spent,credit broken, and conduct out of keeping,a wheen babling bubly bairns, crying pieceminny, parfch minny, the witless wantonwaster is at her wit’s end. Work now orwant, and do not say that the world has war’dyou; but lofty Noddle, your giddy-headedmother has led you astray, by learning youto be a lady, before you was fit to be a ser¬vant-lass, by teaching you laziness instead ofhard labour, by giving you such a high con¬ceit of yourself, that no body thinks any thingof you now, and you may judge yourself tobe one of thpse, that wise people call Little-worth ; but after all, my dear dirty-face,when you begin the warld again, be perfect¬ly rich before you be gentle, work hard forwhat you gain, and you’ll ken better Jiow toguide it, for pride is an unperfe<* fortune,and a ludicrous life will not last iong.Another sort I see, who Iws got more silverthan sense, more gold than good nature, moremuslins and means than good manners; though19a sack can hold their siller, six houses and ahalf cannot contain their ambitious desires.Fortunatus’s wonderful purse would fall infetching in the fourth part of their worldlyWants, and their children imitate their mo¬ther’s chattering like hungry cranes, cryingstill, I want, I want, ever craving, willfully-wasting, till all be brought to a doleful dishof desolation, and with cleanness of teeth, afull breast, an empty belly, big pockets with¬out pence, pinching penury, perfect poverty,drouth, hunger, want of money, and friendsboth, old age, dim eyes, feeble joints, with¬out shoes or clothes, the real fruits of a badmarriage, which brings thoughtless Fops toboth faith and repentance in one day.Thirdly, Another thing I see, hear, andcannot help, is the breeding of bairns, andbringing them up like bull-stirks, they giethem walth o* meat, but nae manners; butwhan I was a bairn, if I didna bend to obe¬dience, I ken mysel what I gat, which learn¬ed me what to gie mine again ; if they hadtoll’d me tuts or prute-no, I laid them o’ermy knee, and a-com’d crack for crack o’ertheir hurdies, like a knock bleaching a barnweb, till the red wats stood on their hips, thisbrought obedience into my house, and ba¬nish’d dods and ill-nature out at the door ; Idang the de’il out o’ them, and dadded themlike a wet dish-clout till they did my bidding:But now the bairns are brought up to spit firein their mither’s face, and cast dirt at their20*■aulcl daddies: How can they be good who ne¬ver saw a sample of it; or reverence old age,who practised no precepts in their youth, ?How can they love their parents who gavethem black poison instead of good principles ?Who shewed them no good, nor taught themno duties ? No marvel such children despiseold age, and reverence their parents as anold horse does his father.Fourthly, The last prevailing evil which Isee, all men may hear, but none strive tohelp, the banishment of that noble holy day,called the Sabbath, which has been blastedby a whirlwind from the south; I am yet a-live, who saw this hurricane coming thro’the walled city near Solway in the South ; itbeing on a Sunday, and a beautiful sun-shineday amangst some foul weeks in harvest wea¬ther, which caused the Lord Mayor of thatplace work hard, and put in the whole fieldsof wheat harvest, and the priests of that-churchcommended him therefore: Because the sea¬son was backward, why should not man bedisobedit'nt! And this infection is come herealso, sure the loss of this Sabbath-day willbe counted a black Saturday to some; whenI walk in the fields, I know it not but by thestopping of the plow, when in the city, onlyby the clossness of a few shop-doors and thesound of the bells; degenerate ideas of reli¬gion indeed ! wdten the high praise is sound¬ed only by bell metal, A semndmg brags andn tinkling cymbal: J t is not come to pass, thentaverns roar like iEtna’s moilth; childrenfollow their gaming, and old sinners theirstrolling about, nothing stopt but coal-cartsand common carriers, the Sabbath lasts nolonger than the sermon, and the sermon ismeasured by a little sand in a glass; many,too many frequent the church, seemingly on¬ly to show their antic dress, with heads of amonstruous form, more surprizing than thosedescribed by Aristotle, as for length exceed¬ing that of an asses head, ears and allandah ! How humbling would it be, to see theirheads struck into such a hideous form, &c.They disdain now to ride on pads as ofold, or to be hobled on a horse’s [hurdies, butmust be hurled behind the tail, safely statedin a leathern conveniency, and there they flyswiftly as in the chariot of Aminadab.They will not speak the mother languageof their native country, but must have sou¬thern oaths, refined like raw sugar thro’ themills of cursing, finely polished, and fairlystruck in the profane mint of London, intoa perfect form of flunkey language; even thevery wild Arabs from the mountain-tops, whohave not yet got English to profane his Ma¬ker’s name, will cry. Cot, cot; hateful it isto hear them swear, who cannot speak.

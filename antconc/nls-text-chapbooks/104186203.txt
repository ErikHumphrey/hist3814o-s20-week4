Montgomery.First Printed in the Year 1597.( ^ OF SCOT UN liKILMARNOCK:PRINTED BY H. CRAWFORD.1817.)THECherry and the Sloe.ABOTJT a bank with balm} bowersBedeck’d in beauty’s fairest flowers,And greens for ever gay ;The Mavis, Merl, and Progne proud,The Linnet, Lark, and Lavrock loud,Saluted mirthful May.When Philomel had sweetly sung,To Progne she deplor’d,How Tereus had cut out her tongue.And falsely her deflowr’d jHer story so sorry ;In speech so fair she seem’d;Her ditty so pretty ;I doubted if I dream’d.II.The Cushat coos, the Corbie cries.The Cuckow couks, the prattling Pyes,To deck her they begin ;The jargon of thp jangling Jays,The croaking CrMtfs, and kackling Kays,They deav’d me with their din.The painted Pawn with Argus’ eyes,Can on his Maycock call.The Turtle wails on wither’d treesAnd echo answers all;Repeating with greetingHow fair Narcissus fell;By lying and spyingHis shadow in the wellm - - sm.I saw the Hurchin and the Hare,In hidlings hirpling here and there,To make their moi'ns repast;The Cat and Coney too were set,Whose dainty downs in de\y were wet.With whiskers feeding fast.The Hart, the Hind, the Dae, the Rae,The Fumart and false Fox ;The bearded Back climbs up the Irat,With bristly bears and brocks:Some feeding, some dreadingThe hunter’s subtile snares.With skipping and tripping,They play’d them all in pairs.IV*The air was soft, serene and sweet.No misty vapours, wind nor weet;But quiet, calm and clear ;To foster Flora’s fragrant flowers,Whereon Apollo’s paramoursHad t'rinkled many a tear :The which like silver shaker* sift’dEmbroid’ring beauty’s bed,Whereon their heavy heads reclin’d.In Iris’ colours clad :Some mopping, somedroppingOf balmy liquid sweet;Excelling and smelling,Thro’ Phoebus smiling heat.V.Methought it was a heavenly thing,Where dew like diamonds did hing,O’er-twinkiing all the trees,To study on the flowery twists. *Admiring Nature’s Aichymists,Laborious busy Bees;■W hereof some sweetest honey sought,do stay their lives from starve,And some their waxen vessels wrought,Their purpose to preserve ;So heaping, for keeping,It in their hives they hide,Precisely and wisely.For Winter they provide.VI.To paint the pleasures of that park,How every blossom branch and bark.Against the sun did shine,I leave to poets to compile,In high heroic stately stile.Whoso muse surmatchcs mine.But as l looked all alone,I saw a river flow.Out o’er a steepy rock of stone,Then lighted fjist below,With tumbling and rumblingAmong the rocks around,Devalling and fallingInto a pit profound.VII. / 'Through roaring of the river rangThe rocks, resounding like a sang,Blyth music did abound ;With trible, tenor counter mean,And Echo blew a bass between.In Diapason sound;Set on Nature’s clearest clift.With thorow base at list;With quaver, crotchet, semibrif.And not a minium mist;Completely more sweetlyA cording flat or sharp,Than muse ere did use ereTo pin Apollo’s harp.VIII.Who could have tir’d to hear that tune,With birds concerting it so soon.5And lays of loresome Larks,Which climb so high in crystal sky.While Cupid, waken’d with the cry,The merry music marks.Who leaving blithe the heavens aboveAlighted on the yeard ;Lo how the little Lord of LoveApproaching me appear’d:So mild like, and child like.With bow three quarters scant,So slyly, and shyly,He looked like a saint.IX.His crisped hair hung o’er his eyes.His quiver by his naked thighs,Hung in a silver lace ;Of gold between his shoulders grew,Two pretty wings wherewith he flewOn his left arm a brace.His shining shafts he quickly shookUpon the grassy groundI run as lightly up to lookWhat ferlies might be found ;Amazed, 1 gazed,To see his geer so gay.Perceiving my having,He counted me his prey.X.Kir youth and stature made me stout,.Of doubleness I had no doubt,But thus bespoke the boy.Quoth I, how call they thee my child?Cupido, Sir, quoth he and smil’d,Please you me to employ :For I can serve you in your suit.So please you to requireWith wings to fly, or shafts to shout,Or flames to set on fire.Refuse then, or chuse then,6Or of a thousand things,But crave shern and have them ;With that I woo’d his wings.XI.What would’st thou give, my friend, guctA he.To have those wanton wings to See,To .sport thyself a while;Or what if I should lend thee here,Bow, quiver, shafts, and shooting geer,Some body to beguile ;That geer quoth I cannot be bought,Yet I would have it fain,What if quoth he, it cost thee nought,But giving It again.His wings then he brings then,And bound them on my back.Go flea now, quoth he, now. .And so my leave I take.XII.I sprang up with Cupido's wingsWho bow and shooting weapons brings,To lend me for a day;As Icarus with careless flight,I mounted higher than I might,Too perilous a play.Then forth I drew that double dart,Which sometime shot his mother,Wherewith I hurt npy wanton heart.In hope to hurt another ;It tiicket me, and pricket me,While either end 1 handle ;Come see now, in me now,The Butterfly and Candle.XIII. 'Like her, allured by the light,1 felt such fondness in my flight.As simple too as she,For as she flies tiil she be fir’d,So with the dart that I desir’d,7My own hand harmed me:1 As foolish Ph<ttent by suit,Did win his father’s wain ;I So long’d I with Love’s shafts to shootNot prizing of the pain.More wilful than skilful,To fly I was so fond,Desiring, aspiring,To what was me beyond.XIV.Too late I learn’d who hews too high,The chips my fall and chafe his eye ;Too late I sought the schools;j Too late I heard the Swallow screech;Too late experience to teach,The schoolmaster of fools :Too late to find the nest 1 seek,When all the Birds are flow’n :' Too late the stable door I ittik.When all the steeds are siown :Too late ay their state ay,All foolish folks espy.Behind so they find soRemeed, and so do I.XV.If I had ripely been advis’dI had not rashly enterprk’dTo soar with borrow’d quill;Not yet essay’d the archer-craft,To shoot myself with such a shaft,As passeth Reason’s skillFrom time I took my wilful wound,I had no force to flee,Then came I groaning to the ground.Friend, welcome home, quoth he;-■Where flew ye ? whom slew ye ?Or who brings home the bopring1 see now, quoth he, now, •Ye have been at the shooting8. _ XVI.Ab Scorn comes commonly with Scaitii,So I behov’d to bide them baithSo fickle was my fate !In stead of cheer I got a checkWhich I might not return or wreck,’Twas bootless to debate.My pride and pain were so extreme,I swelt’ring swoon’d for fear;But ere I waken’d of my dream,He spoil’d me of my gear.With flight then, on height then,Sprang Luptd in the skies.Forgetting and lettingAt nought my careful cries.XVII.So long with looks I follow’d him.My dazzl’d sight grew dark and dimWith staring on the stars,Which flew so fast before ray eyes,Red, yellow, blue, of various dyes •My wits went all at wars,And eyery thing appeared twoTo my bewilder’d brain :But long might 1 lie looking so,Ere Cupid came again ;While thund’ring, with wond’ringI heard up in the air,Thro’ clouds so, he shrouds so,And flew I wist not where.XVIII.What time the little god was gone.And I in languor left aloneIn weariness and wo.Sometimes sighing, sometimes sad.Sometimes musing, sometimes mad:I wist not what to do.And new I rave, and now I rage,Desected, in despair;9To We outwitted by a Page,Encreas’d all nty care.O Dido, CupidsAbandon’d thee, and soHe wins B^e, then shuns me,Alas 1 why does he so ?XIX.With meagre visage, pale and wan,More like an atomy than manI wither’d fast away jAs wax before the fire I feltMy heart within my bosom melt,And piece and piece decay.To quench the flames with fond desire.And sighs I set about.But still the more I blew the lire.The bolder it broke out.My heart then did start thenThe fiery flames to flee,Now throbbing, now sobbing,To leap at Liberty.XX.But O, alas! it was in vain,Perforce it still must suffer pain,Imprison’d in my breast;With sighs and sorrow overset.Like fish entangled in the net,Impatiently opprest,Who thinks, in vain, to strive by strengthStill struggling fall for breath,Which profits nought, alas, at last,But hast’ning en her death ;With wringing and springing,The faster still is she;There I so did lie so,My death advancing me.XXLThe more I wrestle with the wind,The fainter still myself I find,10Nought conlj my thrist appease,I wist I could not walk alone,I was so grievously o’er-gone,'I hro’ drouth of my disease,Yet weakly as I might I rose,In darkness and in doubt,I stagger’d at the windle-straws.No token I was stout jNow sp’ritless and mightlessI wrestle as I may,In anguish to languishAnd wend my weary way.XXII.With sober pace approaching near.Where from the rock the river clear,Of which 1 spake before,Ran swiftly murmdnng amongThe pebbles as it past alongThe flow’ry fringed shore ;Me Pleasure and Desire provoke,Impatient toa-epairBetween the river .and the rock,Where Hope dwelt with Despair,On high then, I spy then,A Cherry tree there grows jBelow too, did grow too,A bush of bitter Shes.XXIII.The Cherries hung above my head,Like twinkling rubies round and red;So high upon the bank,Whose shadows in the river shew.As gayly glittering as they grew,In clusters ripe and rank ;The boughs thro’ burden of their birth,Declming down their tops,Reflex of Phcebus off the Firth,New-coloured all their knops;Vtfth dahcipg and glancing.i 1In pretty wimpling play,While streaming and gleaming'The river glides away.XXIV..Then Dread with Danger and Despair,■ Forbade to mar my mind with care,To rake above my reach.What, tush, quoth Courage man go to,No doughty deed he e’er can do.That spares for every speech ;For / have oft heard Sages say,And our experience tells,That fortune helps the hardy ay.And poltroons ay repels,Then fear not, nor hear not.Dread, Danger, or Despair,The pain you complainOf, is gone ere you get thereXXV.Yet Wisdom wishes thee to weighThis figure in philosophy,A lesson worth thine ear.Which is in time to be a tent*$.nd not when time is past repent:To buy Discretion dear.Is there no honour after life,That thou thyself must kill;Wherefore has Atropos that knifeI trow thou canst not tell;Who but it wouldst cut it,■While Clotho scarce has spun,Destroying thy joyingBefore ’tis well begun.XXVI.What fool art thou to die for thrist,And now may quench it if thou list,So easily, but pain ;More honour is to vanquish ane.Than fight with fifty and be tane,12And either hart or slain.Will Fame her pit7 on thee pourWhen all thy bones are broken ?Yon Sloe, suppose you think it sourMay satisfy to slocken ;O youth, now, the drouth now,Which dries thee with desire.Assuage then, the rage then,Foul water quenches fire.XXVII.What is the way to heal thy hurt ?What is the way to stay thy sturt ?What means may make thee merry ?What is the comfort that you crave,Suppose these Sophists thee deceive,Then knowest it is the Cherry ;Since for it only then thou thrist.The Sloe can be no-boot,In it alone thy hopes consist,And in no other fruit.Why quakest thou and shakest thou,Astonish’d at our strife,Advise thee, it lies thee.On no less than thy life,XXVIII.If we two held not up thy heart.Which is the chief and nobler part.It were not for thy weal,Considering those companions canDissuade a silly simple man,To hazard for bis heal;Although they have deceived some,Ere they and we did meet.They get no credit where we come,With any man of sp’rit.By reason their treason,By us is plain espy’d,Revealing their dealing,Which dare not be deny’d.13XXIX.While Danger and Despair retir'd.Experience came and enquir’dWhat all the matter mean’d :With him came Reason, Wit, and Skill,And they began to ask at Will,Where make ye to my friend!To pluck yon lusty Cherry, lo,Quoth he and quit the Si a: ;Quoth they is there no more ado,Or ye win up the brae ?But to it, and do it,Perforce the Iruit is pluckt.Well brother, some otherWere fitter to conduct.XXX.We grant ye may be guid eneuch;But yet the hazard of yon heuchRequires a graver guide,As wise as ye may go wrang,Therefore take counsel ere ye gang.Of some that stand beside.But who were yon three ye forbadeYour company right now ;Quoth Will three preachers to persuadeThe poison’d Slae to pea.They tattled and prattledA long half hour and mair ;Foul fall them, they call themDread, Danger and Despair.XXXI.Call Danger back again, quoth Skill,To see what he can say to Will,We see them shod so strait;We may not tiust what ilk one tells.Quoth Courage, we concluded else.He serves not for our mate;'For I can tell you all prequeer,His counsel ere he come.114QuothWill whereto should he come hereHe cannot hold him dumb.He speaks ay, and seeks ay.Delay of time by drifts ;■ He grieves us, and deives usWith sophistry and shifts,XXXII.Why may not these three lead this one, I led a hundred mine alone,But counsel of them all.I grant quoth Wisdom, ye have led,But I would ask how many sped,Or further’d, but a fall.But either few or none I trow,Experience can tell;He says the man may blame but youThe first time ere he fell.He kens then, what pens thenYou borrow’d him to flee;His wounds yet that stounds yet,He gat / think thro’ thee.XXXIII.That quoth Experience is true,Will flatter’d him when once he flew:Will set him in a low •,Will has his counsel and convoy.To borrow from the blinded boyHis quiver, wings, and bow ;Wherewith before he ’say’d to shootHe yielded not to youth,Nor yet had need of any fruit,To quench his deadly drouth,Which pines him and dwines himTo death I wot not how,/y Will then, did ill then,Himself remembers now.XXXIV.Quoth Skill, why should we longer strive ?Far better late than never thrive ;' 15Come let us help him yet:Past time we may not prove again ;We waste the present time in vain,Beware of that, quoth Wit:Speak on. Experience, let’s see.We think ye hold ye dumb.Of by-gones I have heard quoth heI know not things to come.Quoth Reason, the seasonWith slowthing slides away ;Then take him, and make himA man, if that ye may.XXXV.1 hen altogether they beganTo call, come on, thou crazy manWhat is thy will advise ?Abash’d, a little while / stay’d,Musing or / answer madeAnd turn’d me once or twice,Beholding every one about.Whose motions mov’d me maist.Some seem’d assur’d, some were in doubt,Will ran red-wood for haste.With wringing and flinging,For madness them amang;Despair too, for care too,Would needs himself go hang.XXXVI.Which when Experience perceiv’d,Quoth he, remember if we rav’d,As will advanc’d of late,When that he swore, he nothing sawIn age but anger, slack and slaw,And canker’d of conceit.Ye could not luck as he alledg’d.That all optaions priz’d,He was so fierce and fiery edg’dHe deem d us ill advis’d.Who seances all changes.16Quorh Le, no worship wins, •To some best shall come bestThat hap well, speed well r'uis.XXXVlhYet, quoth Experience, behold,Fcr all the tales that he' has told,How he himself behaves,Pecause Despair could not come speed,Lo where he hangs all but the head.And in a widely waves.If they be sure ones, you may see.To him that with them raells;If they had hurt or helped thee,Consider by themselves.Then chuse thee, to use then.By us, or such as yon *,Say soon, now, have done nowMake either off or on.XXXV111.Assure thyself, if once we shed,Thou shalt not get thy purpose sped ;Take teut we have thee told ;Have done, and drive not off the day ;The man that will not when he may.He shall not when he would.What wilt thou do, I would we wist,Accept us or give o’er ;Quoth I, I think me raair dian blest.To find such famous four;Beside me, to guide me,Now when I have to do.Considering the twidderingYe found me first into.XXXIX.When Courage crav’d a stomach stout;And Danger drave me into doubt,With his companion Dread;Whiles Will would up alolt m air,Whiles / was drown’d in despair.17Whiles Hspe held up my head:Such pithy reasons and repliesOn every side they rfiew.That 1 who was not very wiseI bought all their tales were trueSo many and bonyOld problems they propoundBoth quickly and likely,1 marvell’d meikle on't,XL.With Courage ye were quite content,Ye never sought our small consent,Nor of us stood in awe:Their logic lossons ye believ’d ;Determin’d to be deceiv’d.Allegiance past for law jFor all the proverbs we perus’d.Ye thought them scanty skill’d ;Our reasons had been better rus'd.Had ye been as well will’dTo our side as your side.So truly I may term it.We see now in you now.Affection does affirm i*.■ XLI.Experience then smirking smil’dWe are no babes to be beguil’d.Quoth he, and shook his head.For authors who appeal to us.They would not go about the buss,i To foster deadly feid ;For we are equal to ye all,No person we respect.We have been so, are yet, and shallBe found so in effect.If we were as ye were,We had come unrequir’d,But we now, ye see now.Do nothing undesir’d.18XLII.Sir, by that sentence you have said, "I pledge, or all the game be play’dThat some shall spring a leak ;Since yc but put me now to prove,Such heads as help for my behove,Your warrant is but weak :Ask at the man yourself and see,Suppose ye strive for state.If he regarded not how heHad learn’d my lessons late ^And granted he wantedBoth Reason Wit and Skill*Complaining and maining.Our absence did him ill.XLIII.Confront him further face to face.If yet ha rues his rackless race,Perhaps and y«iU shall hear:For ay since Adam and since Eve,Who first thy leisings did believe/ sold thy doctrine dear!What has been done, even to this day,I kpep in mind almaist,Ye promise further than ye pay.Sir, Hope for all your haste ;Promitting, outwitting,Your heights you never hooked,I show you, / know you,Youc bv-gones /have booked.XL1V.Then Hope reply’d, and that with pith,And wisely weigh’d his words therewithSeatentiously and short:Quoth he, / am the anchor grip.That saves the sailor and the ship,From peril to the port.Quoth he, oftimes the anchor drives,As we have found before,19And loses many thousand lives*.By shipwreck on the shore.Your grip oft, doth slip oft.When men have most to do,Then leaves them, and reaves themOf thy companions too.XLV.Thou leaves them not thyself alone,But to their grief when thou art gone,Makes Courage quite them else,Quoth Hope, / would you understood,/ hold fast if the ground be good,And flit where it is false.There should no fault with me be found;Nor I accus'd at all.Blame such as should have plumm’d the groundBefore the anchor fall;Their lead ay, at need ay,Might warn them if they would ;If they there, would stay there,Or have good anchor hold.XLV I.Except the Cherry he hath chose^Be ye his friends, we are his foes.His dofngs we despite :If we perceive him settled so.To satisfy him with the Sloe,His company wre quite.Then Dread and Danger grew fuH glad,And wist that they had won,They thought all seal’d that they had said,Since they had first begun ;They hight -.hen, they might then,Without a party plead,But yet there, with wit there,They were set down with speed,XLVH. .(Mrs, Dread and Danger then quoth Wit,||fe did yourselves to me submit,20Experience can prove jThat, quoth Experience, I past,Their own confessions make them fast.They may no more remove.For if /right, remember me,This maxim then they made,That well the man of wit should weighWhat Philosophs have saidWhich sentence, repentanceForbade him dear to buy.They knew then, how true then.And press’d not to reply.XLVIII,Tho’ now were Dread and Danger dumb,Yet Courage would not be e’ercome,Hope hight him such a hireHe strait bethought how soon he sawHis Enemies were, laid -so low,It was no time to tire:He hit the iron in the heat,Before it could grow cold vFor he esteem’d his foes defeat,When once he found them sold :Tho’ we now, quo’ he now,Have been so free and frankOf right yet, he might yet,For kindness could us thank..XL IX.Come on qudth' he, companion Skill,You understand both good and ill.In Physic ye are fine ;Be mediciaer to the man,And shew such cunning as you can,To put him out of pine ?First search the ground of all his grief,What sickness you suspect,Then look what lacks for his relief,Or further he infect.Comfort him, exhort him.21Give him your good advice*And scant not, nor want not.For peril nor for price.L.Quoth Skill, his senses are so sick,I know no liquor worth a leekTo quench his deadly drouth :Except the Cherry help his heat.Whose quenching juices sharp and sweet,Might melt into his mouth;His melancholy to remove.And mitigate his mind :None wholcsomer for his behove.Nor of more of more cooling kind.No nectar, director,Could all the gods hirq give.Nor send him to mend him,None better I believe.LI.Then Reason rose, with gesture grave,Conveening quickly all the leave.To hear what they would say ;With silver scepter in his hand,As chieftain chosen to command.And they bound to obey.He paused long before he spake.And in a study stood.Then he began and silence broke.Come on, quoth he, conclude.What way now, we may now.Yon Cherry come to catch ;Speak out sirs, about sirs,Have done, let us dispatch.LII.Quoth Courage, scourge him first that scars.Much musing memory but mars,I tell you mine intent:Quoth Wit, who will not partly pause,In peril perishes perchance,22O’er rackless may repent.Then quoth Experience and spoke,Sir, I have seen them baith,In braidiness and lie aback,' Escape and come to skaith,But what now of that now,Sturt follows all extremes ;Retain then, the mean then,The surest way it seems.LIII.Rebuking Dread and Danger sore.Suppose they meant well evermoreTo me as they had swore;Because their neighbours they abus’d,In so far as they had accus’d,Them, as ye.b-ard before ;Did he not else, quoth he consentThe Cherry for to pou ?Quoth Danger we are well content,But yet the manner how ?We shall now, e’en all now,Get this man with qs there;It rests then, and’s best the9>Your counsel to declare,L1V.Well said quoth Hope and Courage nowWe thereto will accord with you,And shall abide by them;Like ns before we did submit,Now we repeat the same as fitWe mind not to reclaim ;Whom they shall chuse t« guide the way,We shall them fellow straight.And further this man what we may,Because we have so hight;Promitting but fitting,To do the thing we can,To please baith, and ease baith,This silly sickly man.LV.When Reason heard this then quoth he,I see your chiefest stay to be.That we have nam’d no guide ;The worthy counsel hath therefore,Thought good that Wit should go beforeFor perils to provide;Quoth Wit there is but one of threeThings / shall to thee show.Whereof the first two oannot beFor any thing I know :The way here so high hereIs, that we cannot climb,Even o’er now, we four now,That will be hard for him.LVI.And next for us to wind about,Where this high range of rocks run out, .The stream is there too strong ;And also passeth wading deep,And breader far than we dare leap,It surely would be wrong,It spreads still broader to the sea.Since from the spring it came.The running dead doth signifyThe deepness of the same ;I leave now to prieve now.How that it slowly slides.As sleeping and creeping,But nature so provides.LVII.Our way then lies below the fall,Whereby I warrant speed we shall,The way is wide and plain;The water also is right shallow,I’ll lead the way. and ye shall followNor find your labour vain.For as we find a mischief growOft of a trifling thing,24So likewise doth this river flowForth of a little spring;Whose trot, Sir, I wot, Sir,You may stop with your hand,As you, Sir, I trow, Sir,Experience understand.LVIII.That quoth Experience, I do.And all ye said ken to be true.Since first when ye began ;Quoth Skill and I the same approve^Quoth Reason then let us remoye.This silly Slothful man.Wit and Experience, quoth he.Shall go before apace.The man shall come with Skill and me,Into the second place;Out-o’er now, you four now,Shall come into a band,Proceeding and leadingEach other by the hand.LIX.As Reason order’d all obey’d.None were too rash, none were afraid,Our counsel was tight wise;As of our journey, Wit did note.We found it true, in every jot.Had blest the enterprise.Fbr even as we came to the tree.Which as ye heard us tell.Could not be climbed so suddenlyThe fruit for ripeness fell;Which hasting, and tasting,I found myself reliev’d.Of sickness, and weakness.That mind and body griev’d.

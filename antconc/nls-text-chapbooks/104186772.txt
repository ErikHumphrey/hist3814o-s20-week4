33Home, Sweet Home,.Look forward with Hope forTo-Morrow,AULD ROB MORRIS,TIIU HARP THAT ONCE,ANDDONALD MACDONALD.STIRLNIGPRINTED BY WILLIAM MACNIE,And Sold Wholesale and Retail.1829.HOME, SWEET. HOME.*Mid pleasures and palaces though we may roam.Be it ever so humble, there’s no place like home;A charm from the skies seems to hallow us there,Which seek through the world, is ne’er met with else-'where.Home, home, sweet, sweet home,There’s no place like home, there’s noplace like home.An exile from home, splendour daxzels in vain,O give me my lowly thatched cottage again;The birds singing gaily, that came at my call,Jjive me them, with the peace of mind, dearer tlAn aHHome, home, &c.The fond mother’s son, when he leaves his loved shoreHe thinks on that home he will never see more ;Amidst all his travels, whilst abroad he does roam,He sighs and exclaims, there’s no place like home.Home, home, &c.The sailor, likewise, sails where billows do foam,Amidst different wonders he still thinks on home ;He thinks on those days that are Ung past and gontAnd with watery eyes, drops tears for his home.Home homo, &c.s4'l: The ricli and the poor after pleasore do groan,And after long journies, finds no mansion like home.Let’s go where we will, to new prospects still prone,We stiH look and long for our dear native home.Home, home, &c.LOOK FORWARD VITH HOPE FORTO-MORROW.IN the downhill of life, when I find I'm declining,May my fate no less fortunate be.Than a snug elbow chair can afford for reclining.And a cot that o'er’ooks the wide seaWith an ambling pad poney, to pace o er the lawn,While I carol away idle sorrow jAnd blithe as the lark, that each day hails the dawn,Look forward with hope for to-morrow.With a porch at my d®or, both for shelter and shadetoo,As the sunshine or rain may prevail ;A small spot of ground for the use of the spade too,And a barn for the use of the flail.A cow for my dairy, a dog for my game,And a purse when a friend wants to borrowI’ll eflTjr no Nabob his riches or fame,Nor tv bat honour awaits to-morrow.4From the bleak northern blast may ray cot be com¬pletelySecured by a neighbouring hil^jAt night, may repose steal upon me more sweetly,Ey the vide of a murmuring rill;And, while peace and plenty I find at my board,With a heart free from sickness and sorrow,With my friends will I share what to-day may afford,And let them spread the table to-morrow.But when I at last must throw off this frail cover¬ing.Which I’ve worn for threescere years and ten,@n the brink of the grave I'll not seek to keep hove¬ring,Nor my thread wish to spin o'er again;Eut my face in a glass I'll serenely survey,And with smiles count each wrinkle and furrow,As this old worn-out stuff which is thread-bare to-day,May become everlasting to-morrow.AULD BOB MORRIS.There’s auld Rob Morris that wons in yon glen,He’s the king o’ good fellows and wale o' auld men ;He has goud in his coffers, he has owsen and kineAnd ae bonny lassie, his darling and mine.She’s fresh as the morning, the fairest in May ;She’s sweet as the ev'flinj amaug the new hay,3%5As blythe and as artless as fambs on the It a,And dear to my heart as the light tu my ee,Hut oh, she's an heiress, auld Itobiu's a laitd,My daddie has nought hut a cot-house and yard ;A wooer like me manna hope to come speed,The wounds 1 maun hide that will soon be ray dead.The day comes to me, but delight I have nane,The night comes to me, but ray rest it is gane,J wander my lane like a night troubled ghaist,And I sigh as my heart is wad burst in my breast.0 had she but been of lower degree,1 then might bae hope she wad smile upon me !O how past describing wad then be my Ijless,As now my distraction no words can express.THE HARP THAT ONCE.The Harp that once throngh Tara’s hallsThe soul of music shed,Now hangs as mute as Para's wallsAs if that soul was fled :—So sleep's the pride of former days,So glory's thrill is o'er ;And hearts that once beat high for praise,Now feel that pulse no more.6No more to chiefs and ladies brightThe harp of Para swells ;The chord alone, that breaks at night,It's tale of ruin tells :Thus Freedom now so seldom wakes,The only throb she gives,Is when some heart indignant breaks,To show that still she lives.DONALD M DONALD.My name it is Donald M Dnnald,I live in the Highlands sae grand ;I’ve folio* ed our banners, and will do,Wharever

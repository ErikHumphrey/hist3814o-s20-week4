THE MOSTREMARKABLE PASSAGES-.IN THELIFEOF THE HONOURABLEColonel JAMES GARDINER,WHO WAS SLAIN ATTEE BATTLE OF PRESTONPA2T$iIN THEREBELLION,1745*By P. DODDRIDGE, JD.V.FALKIRK:PRINTED T. JOHNSTON.1805.REMARKABLE PASSAGESIN THELIFEO FS^Colonel JAMES GARDINER.The reader here is to furvey a chara&er offuch eminent and various goodnefs, as might de¬mand veneration, and infpire him with a defire toimitate it too, had it appeared in the obfcurei: rank ;but it will furely command fome peculiar regard,when'viewed info elevated and important a ftation,efpecially as it {hone, not in eccleliallical, but mili¬tary life, where the temptations are fo many, andthe prevalency of the contrary chara&er fo great,that it may feem no inconfiderable praife and felicityto be free from diflblute vice,.and to retain what inmolt other prcfeffions might be elleemed only a me¬diocrity of virtue. It may furely, with the higheftjuftice, be expected, that the title and bravery ofColonel Gardiner Will invite many ot our officersand foldiers, to whom his name has been long hon¬ourable and dear, to perufe this account of him withfome peculiar attention: In coniequence of which,it may be a means of eacreafmg the number andbrightening the charaAer of thofe who are alreadyadorning their cffict, their countyy, and their religi¬on ; and of reclaiming thofe who will fee ratherwhat they ought to be, than what they are. On thewhole, to the gentlemen of the fword, 1 w-ouid par¬ticularly offer thefe memoirs, as theirs by io dif-tinguiilied a title ■, yet, I am firmly perfuaded,( 3 )there are none whofe office, is fo facred, or whofeproficiency in the religious life is fo advanced, butthey may find fomething to demand their thankfiil-nefs, and to awaken their emulation.Colonel James Gardiner was the fonof CaptainPatrick Gardiner, of the family of Torwoodhead,by Mrs. Mary Hocige, of the family of Gladfmuir.The Captain, who was proprietor of a handfomeeftate, ferved many years in the army of K. Williamand Anne, and died abroad with the Britifli forcesin Germany, foon after the battle of Hochltedt.through the fatigues of that celebrated campaign.—He had a company in the regiment of foot oncecommanded by Col. Hodge, his valiant brother-in law,who was flain at the head of that regiment (my me¬morial from Scotland fays) at the battle of Steenkirk,which was fought in the year 1692.Mrs. Gardiner, the Colonel’s mother, was a ladyof a very valuable charafter ; but it pleafcd God toexercil’e Iter with very unaommon trials: for Ihenot only loft her hufband and her brother in thefervice of their country, as before related, but alfoher elded fob, Mr. Rd)er#Gardiner, on the davwhich completed th 16th year of his age, at thefiege of-Namur in 169.5. ^uc there is great reafonto believe God bltfl’e thefe various and heavy af-lliftions as the means of forming her to that eminentdegree of piety which will render her memoryhonourable as long as it cuminues.Her fecond fon, the \. or thy per ion of whom I amnow to give a more particular account, was bomat Camden, in Linlithgowihire, on the 10th ofJanuary, 16S7-8, the memorable year of the Revo¬lution, which he highly e;teemed among the happieflevents of his time; fo that when he \\a> flain in thedefence of thole liberties which God then, by fogracious a providence, refeued from utter deftruc-C 4 )tion, (viz. on the 21 ft of Sept. 1745,) he was aged57 years, 8 months, and 11 days.The annual return of his birth-day was obfervedby him in the latter and better years of his life, ina manner very different from what is commonlypra<ftifed ; for inftead of making it a day of feftivity,I am told, he rather diilinguithed it as a feafon ofmore than ordinary humiliation before God, both incommemoration of thofe mercies which lie receivedin the firft opening of li e, and under an affectionatefenfe, as well of his long alienation from the GreatAuthor and fupport of being, as of the many imper-fe&ions which he lamented in the beft of his daysand fervices.I have not met with many things remarkableconcerning the early years of his life, only that hismother took care to inftrufl him with great ten-dernefs, and affc&ion in the principles of trueChriftianity. He was alfo trained up in humanliterature at the fchool in Linlithgow, where hemade a very conliderable progrefs in the languages.I remember to have heard him quote fome paffogesin the Latin claflics very pertinently, though hisemployment in life, and the various turns whichhis mind took under different impulfes in lucceedingyears, prevented him from cultivating i’uch ftudies.The good effefls of his mother’s prudent andexampiary care were not fo confpicuous as Ihewiflted and hoped in the younger part of her fon’slife ; yet there is great reafon to believe they werenot entirely loft: as they were probably the occa-fion of many convifuons which, in h.s younger years,were overborne ; lb, I doubt not, that when religi¬ous imprefiions took that llrong hold of his heart,which they afterwards did, that ftock of knowledgewhich had been ft early laid up in his mind, wasfound of confide ruble tervice : And I have heard himnuike the obfervation, as an encouragement to pa-( 5 )rents and other pious friends, to do their dufy, andto hope for thofe good cpnfequehces of it, whichmay not immediately appear.Could his mother, or a very religious aunt (ofwhofe good inftruftions and exhortations I haveoften heard him fpeak with pleafure) have prevailed,he would not have thought of a military Ihe ; fromwhich it is no wonder thefe ladies endeavoured todifluade him, considering the mournful experiencethey had of the da- gcrs attending it, and the dearrelatives they had loft already by iti But it fultedhis tafte ; and the ardour of his fpirit, animated bythe perfuafions of a friend, who greatly urged it,was not to be reftrained. Nor will the readerwonder, that, thus excited and 1’upported, it eafilyoverbore their tender remoftftrances, uN n he knownthat this dvtly youth fought t'nree duels before heattained to the ftalure of a man; in one of which,when he was about eight years old, he receivedfrom a boy much older than himfelf, a wound in theright cheek, the fear of which was always veryapparent. The falfe fenfe of honour which inlti-gated him to it, might feem indeed fomething excuf-able, in thefe unripened years, and confidering thethe profeflion of his father, brother, and unde ; butI have often heard him mention this raflanefs withthat regret which the refle&ion would naturallygive to fo wife and good a man in the maturity oflife. And I have been informed, that after his re¬markable converfion, he declined accepting a chal¬lenge, with this calm and truly great reply, which,in a man of his experienced bravery, was exceedinggraceful: “ I fear linning, though, you know, I do“ not fear fighting.”He ferved firft as a Cadet, which muft have beenvery early; and then, at 14 years old, he borean ICnfign’s commifiion in a Scotch Regiment in theDutch Service; in which he continued till ti e ys"I^rz. when (if my mforrr.aliot. \tC rit;'1 t) 1-.e fej-an Enlign’s commiffioo from Que^h. Anne, v-hiti. i-. jbore in the battle of Ratnillies, being then in the19th year of bis age. In this ei’er-memorable aftionhe received a wound in Ids mouth by a mufket bail,which hath often been reported 'to be the ocer-lionof his converfion. That report was a miilaken one;but as fome very remarkable circumhances attendedthis affair, which 1 have had the pleafure of hearirgmore than oitce from his own mouth, I hope myreader will excufe me, if I give him fo uncommona Rory at large.Our young officer was of a party in the ForlornHope, and was commanded on what feemed almofha dei'perate f'erviee, to difpoffefs the French of thechurch-yard at Rainiilies, where a confiderable num¬ber of them were polled to remarkable advantage.They fucceeded much better than was expefted ;and it may well be fuppofed, that Mr. Gardiner,who had before been in leveral encounters, and hadthe view of making his fortune to animate the na-4»ural intrepidity of his fpirit, was glad of fuch anopportunity of fignalizing.bimfelf. Accordingly hehad planted his colours on an advanced ground; and■while he was calling to his men (probably in thathorrid language which is fo peculiar a difgrace toour foldierv, and fo abfurdly common in inch ar¬ticles of extreme danger) he received a {hot into hismouth, which, without beating out any of his teeth,or touching the fore part of his tongue, went thto’his neck, and came out. about an inch and an half onthe left fide of the vertebrae. Not feeling at firllthe pain of the broke, he wondered what was be¬come of the ball; and in the wildnefs of his furprifebegan to fufpefl he had fwallowed it; but droppingfoon after, he traced the paffage of it by his finger,vhen he could difcover it no other way: which Imention as one circumftance among many whichoccur to make it probable that the greater part ofthote wh« fall in battle by thofe ;oftruments of deat h,feel very little anguiflifrom the molt mortal wounds.This accident happened'about five or fix in theevening,, on the 23d day of May, in the year J700and the army purfuing its advantages again!! theFrench, without ever regarding the wounded (whichurns, it fe-ems, the Duke of Marlborough’s conitantmethod) our young officer lay all night in the field,agitated, as may well be fuppofed, with a great va¬riety ot thoughts. He afi’ured ms, that when lierefle&ed upon the c.ircumflanees of his wound, thata ball fiiould, as he then conceived it, go throughbis head without killing him, he thought God hadpreferred him by miracle; and therefore afluredfyconcluded that lie (houM live, abandoned and defpe-rate as his date then fecmed to be. Yet (which : >nte appeared very altonifiung) he had little thoughtsof humbling hi ml.elf before God, and returning to1iiq; after the wanderings of a life fo liceniioullybegun. Hut expeiting to recover, his mind wastaken up with contrivances to fecure his gold, ofwhich he had a good deal about Him ; and he hadrecoune to a very odd expedient, which provediuccefsful. ^ Expecting to be gripped, lie ftrtt tookout a handiul ol that clotted goi'e, of which he wasfrequently obliged to clear his mouth, or fie wouldhave been choaked ; and putting it in hjs left hand,he took out his money, (which I think was ah.ut19 pilloles) and limiting his hand, and bdineanrathe back part of it with blood, he kept in this polltion till the blood dried in fuch a manner that hishand could not eafily fall open, though any fuddenfurpnfe fliould happen, in which he might lole theprelence of mind which that concealment oiherwifewould have required.In the morning the B rench, who were matters ofthe fpot, uiough their forces were defeated at feme( 2 )chfbince, came to plunder the flair ; *r :l •*:!.••• g >• nto appearance alinoll expiring, one of them v> as j'iitapplying a fword to his bread, to deftroy the littleremainder of life, when, in the critical moment uponwhich all the extraordinary events of fuch a life ashis aiterwards proved, were fufpended, a Cordelierattending the plunderers, iaterpoled, taking him,by his drefs, for a Frenchman, laid, “ Do not killu that poor cliild.” Our young foldier heard allthat palled, though he was not able to Ipeak oneword ; and, opening his eyes, made a fign for fome-thing to drink. They gave him a fup of force fpiri-tuous liquor which happened to be at hand; bywhich, he faid, he found a move f«.nfible refrefhmentthan he could remember from any thing he had tailedeither before or lince. Then fignifying to the Friartf> leufi down his ear to his mouth, he employed thefirft efforts of his feeble breath in telling (what, alas !was a contrived falfehood) that he was nephew tothe governor of Huy, a neutral town in the neigh¬bourhood ; and that, if he could take any method ofconveying him thither, he did not doubt but his unclewould liberally reward him. He had indeed a friendat Huy (who, I think, was governor, and, if I mif-take not, had been acquainted with the Captain hisfather) from whom he expelled a kind reception ;but the relation was only pretended. On hearingthis, they laid him on a fort of hand-barrow, andlent him by a file of mufqueteers toward the place ;but the men loll their way, and got into a wood to-'wards the’evening, in which they were obliged tocontinue all night. The poor patient’s w;ound beingPill undreiTed, it is not to be wondered by this timejt raged violently. The anguilh of it engaged himeavneftly’ to beg that they would kill him outright,i or leave him there to die without the torture of any• farther motion ; and indeed they were obliged to reit}u ccrtlderuble t’tr.e, on account of their own( 9 )W'eartnefs. Thus he fpent the feeond uight in theopen air, without any thing more than ,a commonbandage to haunch die blooa. He hath often men¬tioned it as a moll ailonilhing providence, that hedid not bleed to death; which, under God, he a-ioribed to the extreme co.ldnefs of thefe 2 nights.Judging it quite unfafe to attempt carrying himto Huy, from whence they were now ieveral milesdiftant, his convoy took him early in the morningto a convent in die neighbourhood, where be washofpitably received, and treated with great kindnefsand tendcrnefs. But the cure of Ins wound wascommitted to an .ignorant barber furgeon, w ho livednear the ivoufe; the belt mi4. tlvat could then hemade, at a time when, .it majHae cafily furpoied,perfons of ability in their profefiion had the-ir hant'stoll of employment. The tent which this arttft ap¬plied, was almod like a ])eg driven into the wound;and gentlemen cf.fkill and experience, when theycamo to hear of the manner in which he was treated,wondered how he could polhbly furvive Inch manage¬ment, But, by the blefling of God, on tiiele applica¬tions, rough as they were, he recovered in a fewmonths, i he Lady Abbels,who tailed lam her for,treated him w ith the affedson and care of a mother ;and he. always declared, that every thing which helaw within thefe walls, was conduftcd with the Iti id-ell decency and decorum. He received a great manydevout admonitions from the ladies there; and theywould fain have perfuaded him to acknowledgewhat they thought fo miraculous ^deliverance, byembracing the Catholic faith, as they were pleafedto call it, but they could not fucceed ; for, thoughno religion lay near his heart, yet he had too muchthe ipirit of a gentleman, indantly to change thatform oi. religion which he wore, as it were, loofeabout him, as well as too much good fenfe to fwallowthefe mcmltrous ubUirdities of Popery which imme-C 10 )dr&tely prefeoted themfelves to him, unacquaintedas he was with the niceties of the controveri'y.When his liberty was regained by an exchangeof prH’ohers, and his health thoroughly etlablilhed,he was far from rendering unto the Lcrd aec: rdirgto tliat wonderful difplay of divine mercy which heh; i experienced. I know very little of the particu¬lars of thole wild; thcughtlefs, and wretched years,which lay between the 19th and the 30th of his life;except it be, that he frequently experienced the di¬vine gocdnels in renewed tnftances, particularly inpreferving him in feveral hot military adlions, in allwhich he never received fo much as « wound aftefthis, forward as he was in tempting danger ; and yet,that all thefe years were fpent in an entire aliena¬tion from God, and an eager purfuit of animal plta-fure, as his fupreme good. The feries of criminalamours in which he was almoft incefiantly engagedduring this time, mull probably have afforded iomeremarkable adventures and occurrences; but thememory of them is periflied. Nor do I think it un¬worthy notice here, that amidll all the intimacy ofhis friendlhip, and the many years of cheerful as wellas ferious conVerfe which we fpent together, I neverremember to have heard him fptak of any of thefeintrigues, otherw ife than in the general, with deepand ioltmn abhorrence. This I the rather mention,as it feeirted a molt genuine proof of Ins unfeignedrepentance; which, I think there is great reafon tofufpeft, when people idem to take a pleafure in relating fccnes of \*icious indulg nee, which yet theyprofefs to have disapproved and forfaken.Amidft all thefe pernicious wanderings from thepaths of religion, virtue,and happinets, hempprovedhim tell1 fo well in his military eharaclty, li.ai he wasmade a lieutenant in that year, viz. 1706 : and I amtold, he was very quickly promoted to a Cornet’scoihmiffton in Lord Stair’s regiment of Scotch Greys;( 11 )and on the jtO: of January, 1714-15, was snaJe cap¬tain-lieutenant, in Col. Ker’s regiment of dragoons.He hed the honour of being known to the Earl ofStair fome time before, and was made his aid du-camp\ and when, upon his Lordthip’s being appointedambaffador from his late Majefty to the Court ofFrance, he made fo fplendid an entrance into Paris,Captain Gardiner was his mailer of the horfe ; andI have been told, that a great deal of the care of thatadmirably well adjufted ceremony fell upon him, fothat he gained great creit by the manner in whichhe conducted it. Under the benign influence of hi.sLordihip’s favou r (whi eh to the laft of his life heretained) a captain’s comniidion was procured forhim (dated July lid, in the year J715) in the regi¬ment of dragoons, commanded by Colonel S' anhope,(now Earl of Harrington) ; and in the year 1717,lie was advanced to the majority of that regiment;in which office he continued till it was reduced, inNov. 10th, 1718, when he was put out of commiflion.But his Majefty King George I. was fo thoroughlyapprifed of his faithful and important fervice, thathe gave his figu manuel, entitling him to the firitmajority that would become vacant in any regimentof horfe or dragoons, which happened about fiveyears after to be in Croft’s regiment of dragoons,in which he received a commilfion, dated ill. June,1724; and on the 20th July, the fame year, he wasmade Major qf an older regiment, commanded bythe Earl of Stair.As I am now fpeaking of fo many of his militarypreferments, I will difpatch the account of them,by obferving, that on the 24th. January, 1729-30,he was advanced to the rank of Lieutenant Colonelin the fame regiment, long under the command ofLord Cardogan ; with v hofe friendfhip this braveand vigilant officer was alfo honcured for many years.And he continued in this rank and regiment till the( ** )19th of April, 1743, when he received a Colonel'scommiffion over a regiment of dragoons, lately com¬manded by Brigadier Bland; at the head of whichho- valiantly fell, in the defence of his Sovereign andhis country, about two years and a half after hereceived it.We will now return to that period of his lifewhich palled at Paris, the feene of fuch remarkableand important events. He continued (if I rememberright) fevei'al years under the roof of the brave andgenerous Earl of Stair, to whom he endeavoured1.0 approve himfelf by every inflance of diligent andfaithtul fervice : And his Lordfhip gave no mcorfi-derable proof or the dependence which he had uponhim, when, in the beginning of the year 1715, he in¬truded him with the important difpatches relatingto a difeovery which, by aferies of admirable policy,he had made of a delign .which the French king wasthen forming for invading Great-Britain, in favourot the Pretender; in which the French apprehendedthey were fo fure of fucccls. that it feemed a pointof friendfliip in one of the chief counftllors of thatcourt, to difiuade a dependent of his from acceptingfome employment under bis Britannic Majefty, whenpropofed by his envoy there, becaui'e it w as faid,that in lefs than fix weeks there would be a revolu¬tion in favour of what they called the family of theStuarts. The Captain difpatched his journey withthe utmofl fpeed ; a variety of circumftances happilyoccurred to accelerate it; and they who rememberhow loon the regiments which that emergency re¬quired were railed and armed, will, I doubt not,eileem it a memorable inftance both of the moll cor¬dial zeal in the friends of the government, and of thegracious care ©f divine providence over the lioufeof Hanover ami ti t Britilh liberties, fo incomparablyconncded-v. iih .is- nut 1 eft.( J3 )And now I am come to that aftonifhing part ofhis ftory, the account of his cenverfion ; which Icannot enter upon without affuring the reader, thatI have fometimes been tempted to fupprefs manycircumflances of it, not only as they may feem in¬credible to fame, and enthufiaftical to. others, but as1 am very fenliblc they are liable to great abufes ;which was the reafon that he gave me for concealingthe moft extraordinary from many perfons to whomhe mentioned fome of the reft. And I believe it wasthis, together with the defire of avoiding every thingthat might look like oftentation on tins head, thatprevented his leaving a written account of it, thoughI have often intreated him to do it, as I particularlyremember I did in the very laft letter I ever wrotehim ; and pleaded the pofiibility of his falling amidftthofe dangers to which I knew his valour migft infuch circumftances naturally expofe him. I va- . otfo happy as to receive any anfwer to this le' .r,which reached him but a few days before his death;nor can I certainly fay, whether he had or had notcomplied with my requeft, as it is very pofliblea paper of that kind, if it were written, might beloft amidft the ravages which the rebels made whewthey plundered Bankton.The ftory, however, was fo remarkable, that I hadlittle reaton to apprehend I Ihould ever forget it ;and yet, to guard againft all contingencies of thatkind, I wrote it down that very evening, as 1 heard itfrom his'own mouth: And 1 have now before methe memoirs of that converfation, dated Auguft 14th17395 wiuch conclude with thefe words, (which Iadded, that, if we ihould both have died that night,the world might not have loft this edifying and af-fefling hiftory, or have wanted any atteilau-n cf it1 was capable of giving.) “ N. B. I have written down*l this account with all the exaftnefs I am capable of,*• and could fafely take an oath of it, as to the truth( u )“ of every circufnflatice, to the befl of my remem-“ brance, as the Colonel related it to me a few hour*“ ago.” I do nd$ know that I had reviewed this paperfince I wrote it, till I fet rrtyfelf thus publicly to re¬cord this extraordinary faft; but I find it pun^luallyto agree with what I have often related from mymemory, which I charged carefully with fo wonder¬ful and important a fa£f. One thing more_I willonly premife, that I hope none who have heard theColonel himfelf fpeak fomething of this wonderfulfcene, will be furprifed if they find iome new cir-cumf'ances here ; becauleu he afiured me, at the timehe firft gave me the whole narration, (which was inthe very room in which I new write), that he hadnever imparted it fo fully to any man living before*Yet, at the fame time, he gave me full liberty tocommunicate it tp whomfoever I fhould in my con-icience judge it might be ufeful to do it, whetherbefore or after his death. Accoi'dingly I did, whilehe was alive, recount almoft ea?ery circumflance Iam now going to write, to feveral pious friends;referring them, at the fame time to the Colonel Inm-| felf, whenever they might have an opportunity offeeing or writing to him, for a farther confirmationof what I told them, if they judged it requifue.They glorified God in him ; and, I, humbly hope,many of my readers will alfo do it. I bey will loonperceive the reafon of fo much caution in my intro-ducticn to this (lory, for which therefore 1 lhall make& no further apology.This memorable event happened towards the mid¬dle of July, 17 19; but 1 cannot be exa& as to the- day.The Major had fpent the evening (and, if I millakepot, it was the Sabbath) in feme gay company, andhad an unhappy affignation with a married woman,\, of what rank or quality I did not particularly en¬quire, whom he was to attend exaftly at twelve.The company broke up about eleven ; and not juc.g-( 15 )ing it convenient to anticipate the time appointed,he went into his chamber to kill the tedious hour,perhaps with tome amufing book, or tome other way.But it very accidentally happened, that he took upa religious book, which his good mother or aunt had,without his knowledge, Hipped into his portmantua:It was called, if I remember the title exaftly, TheCbrif’ian Soldier, or. Heaven taken by Storm; andwas written by Mr. Thomas Watfon.' Gudiing bythe title of it that he thouid find fome phrafes ofhis own profetlion fpiritualized in a manner whichhe thought might afford him tome diverfion, he re-folved to dip into it ; but he took no ferious noticeof any thing he read in it: and yet, while this bookwas in his hand, an impreflion was made upon hismind (perhaps God only knows how) which drewafter it a train of the moft important and happycon'equences. There is indeed a poilibility, thatwhile he was fitting in this attitude, and reading inthis carelefs and profane manner, he might fuddenlyfall afleep, and only dream of what he apprehendedhe faw: But nothing can be more certain, than that,when he gave me this relation, he judged himfelf tobe as broad awake, during the whole time, as he everwas in any part of his life ; and he mentioned it tome feveral times afterwards, as what undoubtedlypalled, not only in his imagination, but before hiseyes.He thought he faw an unufual blaze of light fallupon the hook while he w as reading, which he at firidimagined might happen by fome accident in the candle;but lifting upTds eyes, he apprehended, to his ex¬treme amazement, that there was before him, as itwere fufpended in the air, a vifible reprefentationof the Lotd Je4‘us Chrift upon the crofs, im roundedon all fdes with a glory ; and was iirpreUtd, as ifa voice, or fomething iquivalent to a Voice, had cometo him, to this effeft (for he was not confident as to( *6 )the very words) “ Oh tinner! did I fuffer this far thee,“ and are thefe thy returns ?” But whether this werean audible voice, or only a ftrong imprefhon on hismind equally ftriking,he did not teem very confident;though, to the bed of my remembrance, he ratherjudged it to be the former. Struck with fo amazinga phenomenon as this, there remained hardly any lifein him, fo that he funk down in the arm-chair in whichhe fat, and continued, he knew not very exactly howlong, infenfible : (which was one circumftance thatmade me feveral times take the liberty to fugged thathe might poflibly be all this while afleep). But how¬ever this were, he quickly after opened his eyes, andfavv nothing more than ulual.It may eafily be fuppofed he was in no conditionto make arts-' obl’erva ion upon the time in which hehad remained in an infeniibte Hate; nor did he,throughout all the remainder of the night, once re¬coiled; that criminal and deteftable affignation whichhad before engrolfed all his thoughts. He rofe ina tumult of paliions not to be conceived, and walkedto and fro in his chamber, till he was ready to dropdown, in unutterable atlonilhm'ent and agony of heart,appearing to himfelf the viletl monller in the crea<tioli of God, who had all his lifetime been crucifyingChrid afrefti by his fins, and now faw, as he affuredlybelieved, by a miraculous vifion, the horror of whathe had done. With this was conneded i’uch a viewboth of the majefty and goodnefs of God, as caufedhim to lotlie and abhor himfelf, and to repent as indull and allies. He immediately gave judgementagainft himfelf, that he was moft juftly worthy ofeternal damnation. He was allonifhed that he hadnot been immediately itruok dead in the niidlt ofhis wickedneis ; and (which I think deferves parti¬cular remark) though he affuredly believed that hefhould ere long be in hell, and iettled it as a pointwith hirnfelf for ftveral months, that the wiidoinp.nri of God did almoft T)er.-:;Ta.Hy require tlcatJuch an enormous finiier fiioil!J he made an exampleof everi.'rfting vengeance and a fpeftacle, as fucb,both to angels and men; fo that he hardly durftprefume to pray for pardon: yet what he then fuf-fered, was not Co much from the fear of hell, thoughhe concluded it would foon be his portion, ns froma fear of that horrible ingratitude he had fliewn tothe Gad of his life, and to that/ bklbd Redeemer,who had been in fo affe&ing a manner fet forth ascrucified beforc him. To this he refers in a letter,dated from Douglas, April i, 1725, communicatedto me by his Lady ; but I know not to whom it wasaddrefled. His words are thefe: u One thing relat-“ ing to my converfion, and a remarkable inftarce of“ the goodnefs of God to me the chief of finners, I“ do not remember that I ever told to any other“ perfon ; it was this : That after the aftonifliing“ fight I had of my bleffed Lord, the terrible con-“ dition in which I -was, proceeded not fo much from“ the terrors of the law, as from a fenfe of having“ been fo ungrateful a monfter to him whom I thought“ I faw piercedfor my tranfgreflions.” I the ratherinfert thefe words, a» they evidently auelt the civ-cumfiance which may feem moll amazing in this affair,and contain fo exprefs a declaration of his own ap-prehenfion concerning it.The July before his death, he w as perfuaded totake a journey to Scarborough for the recovery ofhis health ; from which he was at leail encouragedto expedl feme little revival. After this, he hadthoughts of going to London, and detigned to havefpent part of September at Northampton. The ex-pe&ation of this was mutually agreeable.; but Pro¬vidence faw fit to difconcert the i’cheme. His lovefor his friends in thefe parts occafioned him to ex¬prefs lome regret on his being commanded back:And I am pretty confident, from the manner in( >S )v-v'h'ch he exprefled himfetf in one of his lah lettersto me, that he had home more important reafonsfor ivifhirtg an opportunity of making a Londonjourney ju!t at that crifis, which, the reader willremember, Was before the rebellion broke out.—■But, as providence determined it otherwife, he ac-quiefeed; and l am well fatisfied, that could he. havediftincUy forfeen the approaching event, lb far as itconcerned his own perion, he would have eiteemed itthe hap pi eft fummens he ever received.While he was at Scarborough, I find bv a letterdated from thence, July r6, 1745, that he had beeninformed of the gaiety which fo unfeafonably pre¬vailed at Edinburgh, where great multitudes werethen fpeuding their time in balls, aflemblies, andother gay amufements, little mindful of the rod of“God which was then hanging over them; on whichoccafion he hath this expreffion: “ I am greatly fur-“ prifed that the people of Edinburgh fhould be em-“ ployed in fuch fooliih divevfions, when our fitua-“ tion is at prefent more melancholy than ever I faw“ it in my life. But there is one thing which I am“ very lure of, that comforts me, viz. ti nt it fliall“ go well with the righteous, come what will.”Quickly after his return home, the flame burft out,and his regiment was ordered to Stirling. It was inthe caftle there that his lady and eldeft daughter en-joye4 the laft happy hours of his company; and Ithink it was about eight or ten days before his deaththat he departed from them there. A remarkablecircumftance attended that parting, which hath beentouched upon by lurviving friends in more than oneof their letters to me. His lady was fo afledleiwhen ihe took her laft leave of him, that flie couldnot forbear burfting emt into a flood of tears, withother marks of unufual emotion. And when heaiked her the reafon, (he urged the apprehenfcon (liehad of lofing 1'ueh an invaluable friend, amidft theC T9 )cWi'gj-rs to which he was then called out, as a veryiuflktent apology. Upon which fhe took particularnotice, that whereas he had generally comforted hercm fuch occafions, by pleading with her that remarkable hand of providence'which had fo frequently, informer inilances, been exerted for his prelervatlor,and that in the greateft extremity, he faid nothit gof it now; but only replied, in his featentious man¬ner, “ We have an eternity to.fpend together.”I have heard fuch a multitude of inconfiftent re¬ports of the circumftances of Colonel Gardiktr’sdeath, that I had almoft defpaired of being able togive my reader any particular fatisfaflion concern¬ing fo interehing a fc-ene: but, by a happy acctdent,I have very lately had an opportunity of being ex-aflly informed of the whole, by that brave man,Mr. John Foster, his faithful fervant, (and worthyof the-honour of ferving fuch a mailer) whom I hadfeen with him at my houfe fome years before, fieattended him in his lad hours, and gave me the nar¬ration at large ; which he would be ready’, if it wererequifite, to atteft upon oath.On Friday, September 20th (the day before thebattle which tranfmitted him to his immortal crown)when the whole army was drawn up, I think aboutnoon, the Colonel rode through all the ranks of hisown regiment, addreffing them at once in the molt/refpe&ful and animating manner, both as foldiersand as Chridians, to engage them to exert themfelvescouragioufly in the fervice of their country, and tonegledl nothing that might have a tendency to pre¬pare them for whatever event might happen. Theyleemed much affected with the addrefs, and expreffeda very ardent defire of attacking the enemy imme¬diately: a defire in which he and another very gal¬lant officer of dilVinguiflied rank, dignity, and charac¬ter, both for bravery and conduft, would gladly havegratified them, if it had been in the power of either.( 20 )Hi earned!)’ prefled it on the commanding efScer,both as the ioldiers were then in better fpirits thanit could be fuppofed they would be after havingpafled the night under arms ; and alfo as the cir-cumflances of making an attack would be fome en-CouragemetU to them, and probably fome terror tothe enemy, who would have had the difadvantage of(landing on the defence : a difadvantage with whichthofe wild barbarians (for fuch moll of them were)perhaps would have been more llruck than betterdifeiplined troops, efpecially when they fought a-gainll the laws of their country too. He alio ap¬prehended, that by marching to meet them, fomeadvantage might have been feeured with regard tathe ground ; with which, it is natural to imagine,he mult have been perfedly acquainted, as it lay juftat his own door, and he had rode over it fo manyhundred times. When I do mention ^thefe things,I do not pretend to be capable of judging l ew farthis advice was on the whole right. A variety ofcircumftances, to me unknown, might make it other-wife. It is certain, however, that it was brave.But it was over-ruled in this refpeft, as it alfo wasiu the difpofition of the cannon, which he wouldhave had planted in the centre of our fmall army,rather than jull before his regiment, which was inthe right wing ; where he was apprehenflve thatthe horfes, which had not been in any engagementbefore, might be thrown into fome diforder by thedifeharge fo very near them. He urged this themore, as he thought the attack of the rebels mightprobably be made on the centra of the foot, wherehe knew there were fome brave men, on whole(landing he thought, under God, the fuccefs of theday depended. When he found that he could notcarry any of thefe points, nor fome others, which,out of regard to the common fafety, he infilled uponwith fome unufual earneftnefs, he dropped fome iu-C 21 )timations of the confequences which he apprehended,[ and which did in fail follow; and, fubmitting to Pro-i vidence, fpent the remainder of the day in makingas good a difpofition as circumftances would allow.He continued all night under arms, wrapped upij in his cloak, and generally Iheltered under a rick of; barley which happened to be in the field. Aboutthree in the morning he called his domeftic fervantsto him, of which there were four in waiting. Hedifmifled three of them with a moft affe&ionate| Chriftian advice, and fuch folemn charges relating! to the performance of their duty and the care ofi their fouls, as feemed plainly to intimate that he1 was taking his laft farewel of them. There is great: reafon to believe that he fpent the little remainder[ of the time, w'hich could not he much above an hour,r in thofe devout exerciles of foul, which had fo longi been habitual to him, and to which fo manv circum-; nances did then concur to call him. The army1 was alarmed by break of day, by the noife of the: rebels approach, and the attack was made before: fun-rife, yet when it was light enough to difcern1 what paffed. As loon as the enemy came withinj| gun-(hut, they made a furious lire ; and i£ is faidill that the dragoons, which conllituted the left wing,I immediately fled. The Colonel, at the beginningi of the onfet, which, in the whole, lalied but a fewminutes, received a wound by a bullet in his leftbread, which made him give a fudoen fpring in hisfaddle; upon which his fervant, who hao led thehorfe, would have perfuaded him to retreat: buthe faid it was only a wound in the flefh, and foughti on, though he prefently after received a fliot in his5 right thigh. In the mean time it \- as difcernedj that feme of the enemies fell by him, and particu-! larly one man who had made him a treacherous vifitf but a few days before, with great profefliens of zeal| for the prefent elUblilhment.( « )Kvents of this kind pafs in lefs time than the de¬fer! ption of them can be written, or than it can beread. The Colonel was, for a few moments fup.ported by his men, and particularly by the braveLieutenant Colonel Whitney, who was fhot throughthe arm here, and a few months after, fell nobly inthe battle of Falkirk, and by Lieutenant Weft,a man of diftinguifhed bravery, as alfo by aboutfifteen dragoons, who flood by him to the laft. Butafter a faint fire, the regiment in general was feizedwith a panic: and thoughAheir Colonel and fomeother gallant officers did what they could to rallythem once or twice, they at laft took a precipitateflight: And, juft in the moment when Colonel Gar¬diner feemed to be making a paufc, to deliberatewhat duty required him to dp in inch a eircumftance,an accident happened, which mult, I think, in thejudgement of every worthy and generous man, beallowed a fufficient apology for expoiing his life tofo great hazard, when his regiment had left him.He faw a party of the foot,, who were then bravelyfighting near him, and whom he was ordered to fup-port, had jio officer to head them; upon which hei'aid eagerly, in the hearing of the perlbn from whomI had this account, “ .Thole brave fellows would be“ cut to pieces for want of a commander;” or wordsto that effcfl, which, while he was fpeaking, he rodeup to them and cried out aloud, “ Fire on, my lads,“ and fear nothing.” But juft as the words wereout of his mouth, an Highlander advanced towardshim with a icy the faftened to a long pole, witlqwhich he gave him fuch a deep wound on his rightarm, that his fword dropped out of his hand; andat the fame time feveral others coming about him,while he was thus dreadfully entangled with thatcruel weapon, he was dragged off from his hcrie.The moment he fell, another Highlander, who, ifthe king’s evidence at Caiiif’e may be credited,( *3 )(as I know not why they fhould not, though theunhappy creature died denying it) was one M‘Naughtwho was executed about a year after, gave him aftroke, either with a broad fword or a Lochaber axe,(for my informant could not exactly diflinguifh) onthe hinder part of his head, which was the mortalblow. All that his faithful attendant faw fartherat this time was, that as his hat was fallen off, hetook it in his left hand, and waved it as a fignal tohim to retreat; and added, what were the lalt wordshe ever heard him fpeak, u Take care of yourfelf:”Upon which the fervant retired to a mill, at thediftance of two miles from the fpot of ground onwhich the Colonel fell, where he changed his drefs,and, difguifed like a miller’s fervant, returned witha cart as foon as poffible ; which yet was not tillnear two hours after the engagement. The hurryof the a&ion was then pretty '.veil over, and he foundhis much honoured mailer not^ply plundered of hiswatch, and other things of vallie, but alfo drippedof his upper garments and boots, yet ftill breathing iand adds, that though he was not capable of fpeech,yet on taking him up he opened his eyes ; which| makes it fomething quettionable whether he was al¬together ini'enfible. In this condition, and in thisil manner, he conveyed him to the church of Tranent,I from whence he was immediately taken into theminifter’s houfe, and laid in bed, where he continuedbreathing, and frequently groaning, till about elevenin the forenoon, when he took his final leave of painand forrow, and undoubtedly rofe to thofe didinguifh-ed glories which are refervedfor thofe w ho have beenfo eminently and remarkably faithful unto death.from the moment in which he fell, it was nolonger a battle, but a rout and carnage. The cruel¬ties which the‘ rebels (as it is generally faid, underthe command of Lord Elcho) inflicted on feme ofthe king’s troops, afttr they had allied quarter,!( 24 )were dreadfully legible on the countenance of manywho furvived it. They entered Colonel Gardiner'shoufe before he was carried off from the field, and,notwithUanding the ftrift orders which the unhappyDuke of Perth (whofe conduct is laid to have beenvery humane in many inllances) gave to the contrary,every thing of value was plundered, to ihe verycurtains of the beds, and hangings of the rooms.—His papers were all thrown into the wildeft diforder,and his houfe made an hofpital for the reception ofthofe who were wounded in the attion.* *AN iACROSTICTO THE MEMORY OFCOLONEL JAMES GARDINER,tVlio fell in the Battle of Pkestonpans, Sept. 21ft. 174AJoy ceafe to flow, while I relate,A mournful tale of Gardiner’s fate,Moll {hocking to the human mind :Envy and cruelty combin’d,Sure did poffefs that rebel blind,’Gainfl reafon could a butcher be.And murder one who could not flee.Rare Champion in his country’s caufe!Dar’d to maintain Britannia’s Laws,In fac ; of danger boldly ftood.Nor flinch’d tho’ he had loft much blood.Even envy can’t his valour ftain,Renovvn’d muft Gardiner’s fame remain.FINIS.7.

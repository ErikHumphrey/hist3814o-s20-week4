Her parents dying when she was young,deft her to ramble abroad at her will; and shesupported herself chiefly by begging. It was[then strongly remarked in her, that she made(observations on people’s features and manners;4!, would sit up whole nights when the atmospherer:f was clear, and seemed as intent on considering!the stars, as the greatest astrologers would be*• with their glasses; this give her a great know-’*ledge of the weather, the alteration of the air, 'and the effect it had j and from her sometimescasually acquainting the neighbouring farmers ofany change which generally took place, her famebegan to spread when young, and she was con-suited by them on almost every occasion ; not afarmer would go to plough, not a sower wouldput the seed in the ground, without first askingthe young gipsy (for so they then styled her) heropinion, and following according to her dictates.Her fame now began to spread, and Bridget’sprescience became more universal; other personsbesides farmers and her neighbours came to con¬sult her, and the truth of her predictions madeher veracity gain ground, and she became thetopic of conversation of the politest circles, manyof whom came in their equipages to consult her;and she never asked for any particular sum, so theunbounded generosity of those who applied to-ker oracles, put her in possession of more moneythan was sufficient to maintain her.As she grew in years, like the generality of oldfolks, she became fond of dumb animals, whichwere her chief companions, and of these she alwayshad numbers; people, indeed, have said hundreds,and others have declared she could call as manyon the earth as she pleased; but this is fabulous,for I never saw more than ten at a time. Dogsand cats were the principal companions of herretirement, which, being of the smallest breed,would, as she sat, creep from different parts of hergarments, and not a little surprise those that cameto see her, and, indeed, frightened many; though,I to do her justice, she desired her visitors not tobe terrified at her domestics, as she termed them,for they were not like many that attended on the, gentry, saucy, imperious, and unfaithful, but were, always attendant on the will of her whose handfed them, nor would injure without provocation,i a lesson, she used to say, she wished was learned: by all mankind.Of a pipe of tobacco our Bridget was exceed-: ingly fond, and, indeed, was continually whiffing;i and as she indeed, humourously used to observe,i she had “ sent more puffs into the world, than« all the quacks in the kingdom;” from a long; contracted habit, likewise, when she was smok-: ing, of ever being seated so that her kneesi almost touched her visage, her limbs became soI contracted, that when she became in years, shei was almost double, which, together with her• enormous length of nose and chin, her pipe, and1 the number of animals about her, made her cuti a most hideous figure, and appear rather un-) commonly terrifying to those who were not! apprised of it.Though this famous old woman had neverI been taught to write, yet, by long practice, sheI had formed to herself a kind of hieroglyphicalI characters, in which she deciphered her observa¬tions, knowledge, and remarks; these I foundconcealed within the thatch of her cave; but asthey were so unintelligible, I thought it wouldbe impossible to make head or tail of such aheap of monsters, and other figures as wereattempted to be drawn; but as I am rather of ai studious turn, I thought as I had made it mybusiness formerly to transcribe the Egyptianhieroglyphics, which, when they were as unistelligible to me as these, I might by perseveraneget at the depth of this valuable manuscript, oat least it would serve to deposit in the Britis"Museum, as the remains of a woman who wasfamous, and whose name was so well knoamong mankind.I was therefore immediately determined _renewing my labours with redoubled ardour anunwearied application, and at length, as perse¬verance and resolution will conquer difficulties,I found it, and the whole mystery was openedunto me. Think of my joy; not the miser whohas found a treasure he supposed lost; notmaiden who finds her lover returned after _long voyage, whom she thought perished in theiwaves, but finds restored to her arms with loveEnd fidelity; not—but a truce with Metaphors. Itis enough to tell the reader that I was at lengthenabled to read this valuable work, and foundby experience, that the maxims and remarks,her observations and judgment, have been ex¬tensive, are true, strongly characteristic, andwould do honour to the most experiencedastrologers.Nature sometimes in her roughest coat dropsher brightest jewel, which for a long time lieshid till developed by some experienced adept.So we may observe of our authoress, that thoughclothed in the meanest garb, nature showedherself in her abilities, and left it for me to handdown to posterity what otherwise would be lostin oblivion.Thinking, therefore, so precious a jewel shouldnot remain long hid, but shed its lustre to alleyes, I immediately set about putting it into7English; which at length I have accomplished,and usher it into the world, requesting the gen¬tle reader to excuse my literal errors; and if heneaps any benefit from this production, I shallnot think my labour ill bestowed, though all themerit is due to the deceased authoress.THE TRUEFORTUNE TELLER.An Explanation of the Circles of the Sphere, andsome other Terms of Astrology, for the easierunderstanding of this Book, and further infor¬mation of the reader.The Equinoctial Circle, Equator, or Equinox, isa great circle or line, equally distant from thetwo poles of the world, dividing the sphere inthe midst.Zodiac is a broad oblique circle, crossing theequinoctial in two opposite places, viz., in thebeginning of Aries and that of Libra, so that onebalf declines towards the south, and in this cir¬cle is comprehended the twelve constellations orsigns, every sign containing thirty degrees inlength, and twelve in breadth. Note also, thatthe first six are northern signs, and the last sixare southern signs.>8The Ecliptic Line, k a line imagined to go»along in the midst of the Zodiac as a girdle, out iof which the Sun never goes; but the Moon and:other planets are sometimes on the one side, *and sometimes on the other side, which is called:their latitudes, only the fixed stars alter not theirilatitudes, whether great or small; but the long-titude of a star is the arch, or parts of the eclip¬tic in degrees, between the beginning of Aries,and the circle which passeth through the bodyof Aries, and the circle which passeth through'the body of the stars; where note, that all thecircles of the sphere, or heavens, whether theyare large or small, have 360 degrees allowed toeach of them.Colours are said to be two great movable cir¬cles, crossing each other at the poles of the world,one cutting the equinox at the beginning ofAries, Cancer, and Capricorn, and so dividingthe globe into four equal parts.Horizon is a great circle passing through thepole of the world, and the poles of the horizon,called the Zenith and Nadir (which are twopoints, one directly over our heads, the otherdirectly under our feet), on which the Sun isalways just at noon, and to go directly Northand South, the meridian is changed; but to goto East and West, it is changed to sixty miles,either way makes one degree, or four minutes oftime diflerence under the equinox, viz., sixtymiles eastward, it is noon four minutes sooner,and sixty miles westward, four minutes later.Tropics are supposed to be two lesser circles,parallel with the equinoctial, and distant fromit on either side 23 degrees 31 minutes each;the ecliptic line touches the tropics of Cancer on9lie north side of the equinoctial, and it touchesdie tropics of Capricorn on the south side thereof«o that the sun hath his motion between these ';wo circles.The Arctic circle is equally distant from the!Torth Pole, as the tropics are distant from the 'Euinox—23 degrees 31 minutes.The Antarctic circle is the same distance frome South Pole.Zones, so called, are five in number, two cold,o temperate, and one hot, which are dividedr the tropics and polar circles from each other;the hot zone is counted between the two tropicsthat are extended from one to the other, being(about 47 degrees 2 minutes broad; the temper-iate zones are extended from the tropics, on eitherside, to about 42 degrees 58 minutes, that isnorthward to the article circle, and southwardto the antarctic circle, and the two cold zonesare each within those two small circles, havingthe poles for their centre.The Poles of the world—two points exactlyopposite to each other in the heavens, one in thenorth, the other in the south, the earth being inthe midst, so that it seems to turn about as if itwere borne up by them; therefore by some it istermed the axle tree of the world, as if therewas a line supposed to be drawn from one polethrough the centre of the earth to the other, andthe earth turning thereon; though Holy Writ 'tells us—“The Lord hangeth the earth uponnothing, it being upheld by his mighty power.”The pole arctic, or North Pole, is elevated abovei our horizon about 51 degrees, and the stars'within that distance from it never set with us,but keep their course round it daily; so likewise10those that are that distance from the South;Pole never rise with us, but perform their coursein the like order.Azimuths are supposed lines, or circles of dis^. tance from the meridian, drawn from the zenithto any degree, or two degrees of the horizon, or*according to the 32 points of the mariner’s connpass, so that in travelling or sailing any way, sup¬posing a circle to go from our zenith directlybefore us to the horizon, is the azimuth, called)the vertical point, as well as the zenith.Almicantharats, or Almadarats, or circles ofAltitude, are imagined lines passing through themeridian parallel with the horizon.The Sphere is a round body representing theframe of the whole world, as the circle of theheaven and the earth. This is sometimes calleda martial sphere, for the orbs of the planets arecalled their spheres, that is, the circles in whichthey move.Ascension is the rising of any star, or anypart of the ecliptic above the horizon—Descen-aion is its going down.Eight ascension of a star, is that part of theequinox that riseth or setteth with a star in theright sphere; but an oblique sphere, is that partof the equinoctial in degrees, containing betweenthe first point of Aries, and that part of theequinoctial which passeth by the meridian withthe centre of the star.Oblique ascension is a part of the equinoctialin degrees containing between the beginning ofAries and that of the equinox, which rises withany star or part of the ecliptic in an obliquesphere.Essential difference is the difference betweenItfte right and oblique ascension, or the numberof degrees contained between that place and theB equinox that riseth with the centre of a star, andthat place of the equinox that cometh to themeridian with the same star.Solstice is in the summer when the sun is inthe beginning of Cancer; and in the winter when1 the sun enters into Capricorn; because then theb days seem to stand still, and seem neither toll increase or decrease above two minutes in ten ory twelve days.:[ Constellation is a certain number of stars sup-i posed to be limited within some form or likeness;as Aries the Earn is said to have thirteen stars:—Taurus the Bull, thirty-three; Arcturus, Orion,and the Pleiades, mentioned in Job, ix. 9, areI said to be constellatiads.Planets are the seven cratique, or wandering8 stars, called Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Venus, Mer-Ej cury, Sol, and Luna. These planets have alsoI their several motions, as—Direct, is a planet moving in its naturalcourse, which is forward.Eetrograde, is their moving backward, con-1 trary to their direct motion.Combust is their being under the sun’s beams,3 or within eight degrees of it.Oriental, is when a planet riseth before thea sun—Occidental, after him.Latitude of the earth is the distance or breadthl on either side of the equinox towards the pole,a and they that are under the equinox have no1 latitude, but the poles of the world are in theI horizon. This is a right sphere, and every 601 minutes directly north and south, are said to make: a degree of latitude in an obhque sphere; as12London is counted to be in 51 degrees 32 minutes,the pole thereof being exalted as much. The likeis to be observed in any other place or region.Longitude of the earth is the outside thereof,extending from west to east, crossing the latitudeat right angles; the beginning of which (accord¬ing to some astronomers) is the Canary Isles, sogoing eastward quite round the world, unto thesame place again, which is 360 degrees; andunder the equinoctial is reputed to be 29,600miles, reckoning 60 miles to a degree; but thefarther off the equinoctial the fewer miles in adegree; for at London about 37 make a degreeof longtitude, so these degrees grow less and lessuntil they meet at the latitude of 90, that isunder the poles.Parallels—the lines straight and circular,equally distant from each other, as the equinox^tropics, degrees of latitude, etc.Climate, or clime, is such a space of earthcomprehended between two parallels, in whichspace there is half an hour difference in the suhdials and length of the days.Antipodes are those whose feet are directlyagainst ours, as if a line were drawn from onethrough the centre of the earth to the other.And shis shall suffice for an explanation ofthings, which I have done as briefly as I couldfor the advantage of the reader, to whom possi¬bly, these things so necessary to be known,may have hitherto been concealed.Of the Planetary Days and Hows, and how to knowwhat Plan&t a Man is born under.The planetary hours are those hours in whicheach planet reigns, and has the chief dominion,of which, the ancients gave the followingaccount.Saturn is lord on Saturday—Jupiter is lordon Thursday—Mars is lord on Tuesday—Sol islord on Sunday—Mercury on Wednesday—Venus on I riday—and Luna on Monday.On Saturday, the first hour after midnight,Saturn reigns, the second Jupiter, the thirdMars, the fourth Sol, the fifth Venus, the sixthMercury, and the seventh Luna; and then againSaturn the eighth, and so on to Mars the 24th jand then Sol beginneth the first hour after mid¬night on Sunday, Venus the 2nd, and so on;Luna the first on Monday, and Saturn the 2nd jMars the first on Tuesday, Sol the 2nd, and soforward, planet by planet, according to theirorder, by which every planet reigns the firsthour of his own day; and so likewise the eighth,fifteenth, and twenty-second; as for instance,Saturn reigns the first hour, the eighth, fifteenth,and twenty-second on Saturday, Sol the samehours on Sunday, Luna the same on Monday,Mars the same on Tuesday, Mercury the sameon Wednesday, Jupiter the same on Thursday,and so Venus on Friday, which I have thus set.But I shall now come to speak of the signifi¬cation of the planetary hour of each planet,and what it portends to them that are born inthem.The hour of Saturn is strong, is good to doall things that require strength; such as fight-A TABLEOf the Planetary Hour of every Bay in the Weeh.SaturnJupiterMarsSolVeuusMercuryLunaSunday.5 12 196 13 207 14 211 8 15 222 9 10 2313 10 17 2414 11 18Monday.

He that is born in thehour of Saturn is slow, dull, and melancholy, ofdogged temper and disposition, black and swarthycomplexion, being quarrelsome, wrathful, andvery malicious.The hour of Jupiter is in all things good, anddenotes peace, love, and concord. He that isborn in the hour of Jupiter is of a ruddy andsandy complexion, fair hair, well-proportionedbody, and of a lovely countenance; his facerather broad than long. He is also courteous, ofa very affable carriage, moral, and religious.The hour of Mars is evil, and denotes the per¬son born it to be of a choleric disposition, and ofa robust strong body, soon angry, and hard to bereconciled: his face red, and his eyes sparklingand fiery, much addicted to fighting, and readyto quarrel with every man he meets, which oftenbrings him to an untimely end.The hour of the Sun signifies great strength,very fortunate for kings and princes. He thatis born in this hour has sharp eyes, brown hair,and a round face, denotes one that is a greaJ;projector, aims at great things, but is often dis¬appointed, and seldom brings his design to pass.The hour of Venus is very propitious and for¬tunate, but it is better by night than by, day,especially mid-day, for the Sun covers it. Hethat is born in this hour has fair hair, soft eyes,a little forehead, and a round beard, very com¬plaisant in his carriage, mighty amorous, a greatadmirer of women, much addicted to singingand dancing, and spends his money in courting.The hour of Mercury is very good, but chiefiyfrom the beginning to the middle. He that is16born in this hour, has stature inclining to tallness, a sharp long face, large eyes, a long nose,his forehead narrow, a long beard and thin hair,long arm and fingers, of a good disposition, and•obliging temper, much given to reading, and verydesirous of knowledge, delighting to be amongbooks, very eloquent in his speech, and yetaddicted to lying, and if he is poor, he is com¬monly light fingered.The hour of the Moon is both good and evil,according to the day; for from the fourth to theseventeenth it is good to those that are bornunder it; but from the seventeenth to thetwentieth it is counted unfortunate to -be bornunder it; and from the twentieth to the twenty-seventh very happy. He that is born in thehour of the moon (especially upon her owrn day)shall be pale faced, of a thin meagre visage, withhollow eyes, and of a middling stature; heappears very courteous and obliging, but is verycrafty and deceitful, variable in his humour,malicious, and his constitution phlegmatic.Thus have I given the reader the judgmentof ancients upon the planetary hours, and whatthey portend to those that are born under them,by which a person, comparing himself to whatis here set down, may easily know under whatplanet he was born.0/ the Birth of Children with respect to the Age ofthe Moon.To be born on the first day of the new Moon,is very fortunate, for to such all things shallsucceed well; their sleep will be sweet, andtheir dreams pleasant; they shall have long life17Slid increase of riches.A chi’d born the second day of the new Moon,shall grow apace; but it will be much inclinedto lust, whether it be male or female. On this dayalso, all thy dreams shall quickly come to pass,whether they be good or bad. It is also good,on this day to open a vein if there be occasion.A child born on the third day of the Moon,shall die soon, or at least short-lived; on this-day to begin any work of moment is unfortunate,for it seldom comes to a good conclusion.On the fourth day of the Moon the child thatis born shall prosper in the world, and be ofgood repute. On this day it is good to beginany enterprise, provided it be done with goodadvice, and with dependauce on Heaven for a.blessing.The fifth day of the Moon is unfortunate^and the child that is born therein shall die inits infancy. He that is in danger, and thinks «to escape this day shall certainly be mistaken.If good counsel be given thee to-day, take it,but execute it to-morrow. This day thou maylet blood with good success.The sixth day of the Moon, the child that isborn shall be of long life, but very sickly. Tosend children to school on this day is very for¬tunate and denotes they shall increase inlearning.On the seventh day the child that is born maylive many years; on this day it is good to shavethe head, to tame wild beasts, and buy hogs, forhe that doth so shall gain much by them. Hethat takes physic this day is like to recover.On the eighth day a child born shall be indanger of dying young; but if he survives his18„ first sickness, he shall live long and arrive at agreat estate. He thjit dreams a dream shallquickly have it come to pass. Anything that islost shall be found.''On the ninth day the child that shall be bornwill be very fortunate, enjoying long life andarriving to great riches. What thou do eachday shall come to a good issue; he that is pur¬sued shall escape; and he that groans under theburden of oppression, shall be opportunely re¬lieved. Do not let blood on this day, for it isdangerous.On the tenth day a child that is born shall bea great traveller, pass through many kingdomsand regions, and at last die at home in his oldage. Do nothing on this day but what you wouldhave known, for all secrets shall be brought tolight.On the eleventh day of the Moon the child thatt is born shall be of a good constitution, and bemightily devoted to religion, shall be long-lived,and of a lovely countenance; and if it be a female,she shall be endowed with wisdom and learning.On this day it is good to marry, for the marriedcouple shall be happy all their lives, and beblessed with many children., The twelfth day of the Moon’s age, in allusionto the twelfth sign of the Zodiac, betokenth ■nothing but sorrow and woe; and the child born .this day shall be given to wrathfulness, and ■subject to many afflictions.On the thirteenth day the child that is bornshall be of a short life, and by reason of peevishcrossness, never be pleased. To wed a wife onthis day is good, for she shall be both lovingand obedient to her husband.19On the fourteenth day the child that is bornshall be an enemy to his country, and seek thedestruction of his prince, which will bring him tohis deserved end. On this day if you give to asick man physic, it shall restore him to hisformer health.On the fifteenth day the child that is bornshall quickly die. On this day begin to woikfor it is fortunate. That which was lost yester-d.ay will be found this day.On the sixteenth day the child born shall beof ill manners, and very unfortunate, insomuchthat though he may live long, yet his life will bea burden to him. It is not good to dream onthis day for they are commonly hurtful, andsuch as come to pass a long time after.On the seventeenth day the child that shall beborn will be foolish to that degree, that it shallbe almost a natural, and thereby become a greataffliction to its parents ; yet to contract matrimony, compound physical preparations, and takephysic is very good ; but by no means let blood.On the eighteenth day the child that shall beborn, if male, will be violent, courageous, andeloquent; and if female, chaste, industrious, andbeautiful, and shall come to honour in her old age.On the nineteenth day the child then born, ifa male, shall be renowned for wisdom and virtue,and thereby arrive to great honour; but if afemale, she will be of a weak and sickly consti¬tution, yet she will live to be married.On the twentieth day the child that shall beborn shall be stubborn, quarrelsome, and a greatfighter, yet he shall arrive to riches and a greatstore of money.On the one and twentieth day the child that30Is born will be unhappy, and though he will bewitty and ingenious, yet he shall be addicted tostealing. He that is minded to keep his money,ought on this day to abstain from gaming, else |he may chance to lose all. Abstain from bleed- fing this day.On the twenty-second day the child born shall *be fortunate and purchase a good estate; he shallalso be of a cheerful countenance, comely, andreligious, and shall be well loved.On the three and twentieth day the child bomshall be of an ungovernable temper, and willgive himself up to wandering abroad in theworld, and seeking his fortune in foreign parts,and in the end shall be mistaken. This is agood day to choose a wife; for he that can meetwith a good wife on that day, should marry herwhile he can have her.On the twenty-fourth day the child then bomshall be a prodigy in the world, and make allmen admire his surprising wonderful actions,which shall exceed those of the ordinary sort ofmen.On the twenty-fifth day the child then bomshall be wicked; he shall encounter with manydangers and at last will perish by them. Thisis. an unfortunate day to those who begin anyenterprise of moment thereon.On the twenty-sixth day the child that shallbe then born shall be very beautiful and amiable,but yet of an indifferent state in the world, if itbe a male; but if it be a female, a rich manmarries her for her beauty.The twenty-seventh day the child that shallbe born shall be of that sweet and affable temperand disposition, that it will contract the love of21every one with whom it shall converse; and yetif a male, shall never rise to any great height inthe world; but if a maiden, the sweetness ofher disposition may advance her, for such atemper is to be esteemed above riches.On the twenty-eighth day the child that isborn shall be the delight of his parents, but yetsubject to much sickness and many distempers,which shall take it away before it is at perfectage.On the twenty-ninth day the child that shallbe born shall be fortunate and happy, blessedwith long life, and attain to an eminent degreeof holiness, wisdom, and virtue. To marry agood wife is a good fortune, and such shall behis that shall marry on this day.On the thirtieth day the child that shall beborn will be fortunate and happy, and wellskilled in arts and sciences.These, and divers other like things, happeuto mankind according to the different ages andcourses of the Moon, which has a great influenceupon all human bodies.I will, therefore, for the advantage and benefitof my readers, treat a little more distinctly ofthe power and influences of the heavenly bodies,as they are laid down by ancient and modemastrologers, who have written upon that subjectmore largely.1A brief Prognostication concerning Children bomon any day of the week.The child born on Sunday shall be of a longlife and obtain riches.On Monday—Weak and of an effeminate32temper, which seldom brings a man to honour.On Tuesday.—Worse, though he may withextraordinary violence, conquer the inordinatedesires to which he will be subject, still he willbe in danger of dying by violence, if he has notgreat precaution.On Wednesday.—Shall be given to the studyof learning, and shall profit thereby.On Thursday.—He shall arrive at greathonour and dignity.On Friday.—He shall be of a strong constitu¬tion, and perhaps lecherous.On Saturday.—This is another bad day, never¬theless the child may come to good, though it bebut seldom; but most children born on this dayare of a heavy, dull, and dogged disposition.Of the evil and perilous Days of every Month ofthe Year.There are certain days in the year which itconcerns all persons to know, because they areso perilous and dangerous; for, on these days ifa man or woman let blood, they shall die withintwenty-one days following; and whosoeverfalleth sick on any of these days shall certainlydie; and whosoever beginneth any journey onany of these days, he shall be in danger of deathbefore he returns. Also he that marrieth a wifeon ahy of these days, they shall either be quicklyparted, or else live together with sorrow anddiscontent. And lastly, whosoever on any ofthese days beginneth any great business, it willnever prosper or come to the desired perfection.Now, since these days are so unfortunate, ithighly concerns every one, both to know and23take notice of them; which that that the readermay do, I have set down in the followingorder:—In January are eight days, that is to say, the1st, 2nd, 4th, 5th, 10th, 15th, 17th, and 19th.In February are three day, that is, the 8th,17th, and 21st.In March are three days, that is, the 13th,16th, and 21st.In April are two, the 15th and 21st.In May three, the 15th, 17th, and 20th.In June two, the 4th and 5th.In July two, the 15th and 20th.In August two, the 10th and 25th.In September two, the 6th and 7th.In October one, the 19th.In November two, the 5th and 7th.In December three, the 6 th, 7th, and 11th.But besides these, there are also the canicular,or dog days, which are those of the greatestdanger and peril; they begin the 19th day ofJuly, and end the 27th of August, during whichtime it is very dangerous to fall sick, takephysic, or to let blood; but if necessity call forit, it is best to be done before the middle ofthe day.Judgments Deduced from the Nails.They who have their nails broad, are of aI gentle disposition, bashful, and afraid of speakingbefore their superiors., or indeed to any withouthesitation and a downcast eye.If round the nails there is usually any excori¬ation, or sprouting of the skin, the person k24luxurious, fearful, and an epicure, loving enjoy¬ment, provided it is to be obtained withoutdanger.When there are certain white marks at theend, it testifies that the person is improvident,soon ruining their fortune through negligence.Narrow Nails.-—The person with such nails isdesirous of attaining knowledge in the sciences;but is never at peace long with his neighbours.If at both ends there is a redness, or mixtureof different colours, the person is choleric, anddelights in fighting.When the end is black, the man loves agricul¬ture ; he places happiness in mediocrity, andfrom thence avoids the cares attendant on eitherextreme of fortune.Fleshy Nails.—A calm person and idler, lov¬ing to sleep, eat, and drink; not delighting inbustle and a busy life.Little Nails.—Little round nails discover aperson to be obstinate, seldom pleased, incliningto hate every one, as conceiving himself superiorto others, though without any foundation forsuch conception.TO THE READER.The foregoing pages are published principally to show thesuperstitions which engrossed the mind of the populationof Sicotlaud during a past age, and which are happilydisappearing before the progress ot an enlightened civiliza¬tion. It is hoped, therefore, that the reader will notattach the slightest importance to the solutions of thedreams as rendered above, as dreams are generally tharesult of a disordered stomach, or an excited imagination.

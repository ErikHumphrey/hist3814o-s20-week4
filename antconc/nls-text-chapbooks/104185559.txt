At last however, thOueen proved with child, and in due tinvwas brought to bed of a daughter. At tfchristening, the Princess had seven Fairiifor her godmothers, \vho were all they couifind in the whole kingdom, that every orof them might give her a gift.The christening being over, a grand feawas prepared to entertain and thank the Eaiies. Before each of them was placed a rnanificient cover, with a case# of massy goiwhereon were a spoon, a knife and fork,pure gold, and excellent workmanship, swith divers precious stones; but, as they we•all sitting down at the table, they saw cotinto the hall, a very old Fairy, whom thTHE SLEEPING BEAUTY, &c. 3tad net invited, .because it was near fiftyears since she had been out of a certainower, and was thought to have been eitherlead or inchanted.The King ordered her a cover, but couldtot furnish her with a case of gold as theithers had, because he had only seven madeor the seven Fairies. The old Fairy fanciedhe was slighted, by not being treated in theame sumptuous manner with, the rest, and ,nurmured out some threats between hereeth.1 One of the young Fairies who sat by her,verheard how she grumbled, and judgingbat she might give the little Princess somenlucky gift, she went as soon as she rose•om the tab!^; and hid herself behind theanging that she might speak last, and repair,i much as possible she could, the evil whichte old Fairy might intend.In the mean while, all the Fairies began tove their gifts to the Princess in the follow-g manner.The youngest gave her a gift, that sheould be the most beautiful person in thetorld.The second, that she would have wit likeangel.S The third, that she would have a wonder-1 grace in every thing that she did.I The fourth, that she would dance perfectly1:11.4THE SLEEPING BEAUTYThe fifth, that she wouldsingperfectly we'And the sixth, that she would play on tkinds of musical instruments to the utmo:perfection.'The old Fairy’s turn coming next, shea<vauced forward, and, with a shaking hea«which seemed to shew more spite then ag<she said, That the Princess would have hthand pierced with a spindle, and die of, tfwound.This terrible gift made the whole compartremble, and every one of them fell to cryinAt this very instant, the young Fairy canout from behind the curtains, and spalthese words aloud.

I am spinning, my pretty child,said the old wo^S, who did not know whoshe was. Ha! said the Princess, this is verypretty; how do you do it? Give it me, that1 may see if I can do so. The old womanto satisfy the child’s curiosity, granted herrequest. She had no sooner taken it into| her hand, than, whether being very hasty atit, somewhat unhandy, or that the decree ofthe spiteful Fairy had ordained, is not to becertainly ascertained; but, however, it im¬mediately ran into her hand, and she directlyfell down upon the ground into a swoon.The good old woman, not knowing whatto do in this affair, cried out for help. Peo¬ple came in from every quarter in great num-ibers: Some threw water upon the Princess’face, unlac’d her, struck her on the palms ofher hands, and rubbed her temples with Hun-3 gary Water*, but all they could do, did notbring her to hei^if.The good Fairy, ww, ^ savea n«»i by condemning her to sletF one.kundre~ years, was in the kingdom of Matakin, twelve6* THE SLEEPING BEAUTYthousand leagues off, when this accident be- ife! the Princess, butshe was instantlyinformedof it by a little ibwarf, who had boots of se¬ven leagues, that is, boots with which hecould tread over seven leagues of ground atone stride. The Fairy left the kingdom im¬mediately, and arrived at the palace in aboutan hour after, in a fiery chariot drawn by ,dragons.The King handed her. :>?t of the chariot,and she approved everycf?iJng he had done;but as she had a very great foresight, shethought that when the Princess would awake,she might not know what to do with herself,being all alone in this old palace, therefore,she touched with her wand every thing inthe palace (except the King and Queen) go¬vernesses, maids of honour, ladies of the bed¬chamber, gentlemen,officers,stewards, cooks,under-cooks, and scullions, guards, with theirbeef-eaters, pages and footmen. She likewisetouched all the^iiorses that were in the sta¬bles, as well pads as others, the great dog inthe outer court, and the pretty little Mopseytoo, the Princess' little spaniel bitch, whichlay by her on the bed. ^Immediately on her touching them, theyall fell asleep, that they might not awake be¬fore their Mistress, and that they might beready to wait upon her when she wantedi /le VPrr <yycs at the fire, as full as:they con hi rS partridges and peasants; andIN THE WOOD. 7rvery thing in the palace whether animate)r inanimate, did fall asleep also.All this was done in a moment; for Fairiesire not long in doing their business.And now the King and Queen having kissed;heir dear child, without waking her, wentDut of the palace, and put forth a prochma-ion, that nobody should come near it. Thisrowever was unnecessary, for in less than aquarter of an hour, there grew up all roundthe park, such a vast number of trees, greatand small bushes, and brambles twining one(with another, that neither man nor beastcould pass thro’, so that nothing could beseen but the very tops of the towers of theipalace; and not that too unless it was a good(way off. Nobody doubted but the Fairy gaveItherein, a very extraordinary sample of her,art, that the Princess, while she continuedIsleeping, might have nothing to fear from|any curious people.When an hundred years were gone andpast, the son of a King Then reigned, andwho was of another family from that of thesleeping Princess, being out a hunting, onthat side of the country, asked what thesetowers were which he saw in the middle ofa great thick wood; every one answered ac¬cording as they had heard; some said, is wasan old ruinous castle haunted by spirits; o-thers, that all tb« sorcerers and witches ofthe country kept then sabbath or weeKiy1 meeting in that place.3- THE SLEEPING BEAUTY*The most common opinion was, that an O-gree# lived there, and that he carried thitherall the little children he could catch, that hemight eat them up at leisure, without an)body being able to follow him, as having him¬self only power to pass through the wood.The Prince was at a stand, not knowingwhat to believe, when an aged man spoketo him thus:<c May it please your Highness,<c It is about fifty' years since I heard frommy father, who heard my grand-father say,that there was then in this castle a Princess,the most beautiful that was ever seen, thatshe must sleep there an hundred years, andwould be wakened by a King’s son, for whomshe was reserved.”The young Prince was all on fire at these!words, believing, without considering thematter, that he could put an end to this rareadventure; and, pushed on by love and ho¬nour, resolved that moment to look into it.Scarce had he advanced towards the wood*when all the great trees, the bushes, andbrambles, gave way of their own accord, andlet him pass through. He went up to thecastle which he saw at the end of a large a-venue, which he went into; and what not alittle surprised him, was, he saw none of his* An Ogree is a Giant with long teeth claws, with a raw iBones; who rims -*vay with naughty httle boysa,ld ?il'-k and cuts them all -i>-IN THE WOOD.9people could follow him, because the treesdosed again, as soon as he passed throughhem.However, he did not cease from valiantly:ontinuing his way.He came into a spacious outward court,vhere every thing he saw might have frozenip the most hardy person with horror. rl hereeigned all over a most frightful silence; themage of death every where shewed itself,nd there was nothing to be seen but stretch¬'d out bodies of men and animals, all seemingo be dead. He, however, very well knewry the ruby faces and pimpled noses of the3eef-eaters, that they were only asleep, andheir goblets, wherein still remained someew drops of wine, piainly shewed, that they.11 fell asleep in their cups.He then, crossing a court paved with mar-ile, went up stairs, and came into the guard-hamber. where the guards were standing inheir ranks, ■with muskets upon their should-rs, and snoring as loud as they could. Af-er that he went through several rooms fullif gentlemen and ladies, all asleep, somelanding, and others sitting. At last, heame into a chamber all gilt with gold, here,e saw upon a bed, the curtains of which/ere all open, the finest sight that ever heie.held, a Princess, who appeared to be about5 or 16 years of age, and whose bright, anda a manner resplendent beauty, hadsomewhat10 THE SLEEPING BEAUTYin it divine: lie approached whh tremblingand admiration, and fell down before her onhis knees.And now the inchantment was at an end,the Princess awaked, and looking on himwith eye- more tender than the first viewmight seem to admit of: Is it you myPrince/' said she to him, “ you have waiteda long time.”The Prince charmed with these words;and much more with the manner in whichthey were spoken, assured her, that he lovedher better than himseif. Their discoursewas so well conducted, they did weep m a-ethan talk, little eloquence, a great deal of love.He w'as more at a loss than she, and no won¬der, as she had time to think on/what to sayto him, for, it is very probable, though thehistory_mentions nothing of it, that the goodFairy during so long a sleep, had given hervery agreeable dreams. In short they talkedfour hours together, and yet said not halfthat they had got to say.In the mean time, all the palace awaked,every one thinking on his particular business;-and, as aiT of them were not in love, theywere ready to die with hunger; the chief ladyof honour being as sharp set as the others,grew very impatient, and told the Princessaloud, that supper was served up. ThePrince helped the Princess to rise, she wasintirely dressed, and very magnificently; butIN THE WOOD.IIhis Royal Highness did not forget to tell herthat she was dressed like his grandmother,and had a point-band peeping over a highcollar, but, however, she looked not lessbeautiful and charming for all that.They went into the great hall of looking-glasses, where they supped, and were servedby the Princess’s officers j the violins and haut¬boys played old tunes; but very excellent,though it was now about an hundred yearssince theyhad played: and, aftersupper, with,out losing any time, the Lord Almoner married them in the chapel of the castle, and thechief Lady ©f honour drew the curtains.They had but very little sleep that night,the Princess had no occasion, and the Princeleft her the next morning, to return into thecity, where his father had been in great painfor him.The Prince told him he had lost His wayin the forest as he was hunting, and had lainat the cottage of a collier, who had given himsome brown bread and cheese. ,The King his Father, who was a very goodman, readily believed him; but his Motherthe Queen, could not be persuaded that thiswas altogether true, and seeing that he wentalmost every day a hunting, and that he hadalways some excuse ready for so doing, tho’he had lain out three or four nights togetner,she began to suspect, and very justly too, hishaving some little private amour on hand.12THE SLEEPING BEAUTYwhich then he endeavoured she should re-|main ignorant of.Now these frequent excursions which hethen made from the palace, were the times;that he retired to the Princess, with whomihe lived in this manner for about twcyearsiand by whom he had two line children, theeldest of whom was a girl, whom they named]Morning, and the youngest a boy, whom theyjnamed Day, because he was a great deal hand-4somer, and much more beautiful and comelyithan his sister.The Queen’s jealousy increasing, she se¬veral times spake to her son, desiring him to*inform her after what manner he spent histime; alledging, that as he saw her so veryuneasy, he ought, in duty, to satisfy her: buthe never dared to trust her with the secret*he feared her though he loved her, for shewas of the race of Ogrees, and the Kingwould certainly not have married her, had itnot been for her vast riches.It was whispered about the court, that shehad an Ogerish inclination, and that when¬ever she saw little children going by, she hadall the difficulty in the world to retrain fall¬ing upon them, and so the Prince would ne¬ver tell her one word.But when the king was dead, which hap¬pened about two years afterwards, and hesaw himself Lord and Master, he then openlydeclared his marriage, and went in greatrIN THE WOOD.13ceremony to conduct hE Queen to the palace.They made a very magnificent entry into thecapital city, she riding in a triumphal car,with her two children beside her.Some time after, the King went to makewar with the Emperor Cantalabute, his neigh¬bour.He left tile government of the Kingdomto the Queen his mother, and earnestly re¬commended to her the care of his wife and| children.As soon as he was departed, the Queen| sent for her daughter-in-law to come o her,I and then sent her to a country-house among; the woods, that she might with more ease| and secrecy gratify her inclinations.Some few days after she went to this coun¬try-house herself, and calling for the clerkof the kitchen, she said to him, 1 have amind to eat little Morning for my dinner to¬morrow.Ah! Madam, cried the clerk of the kitchen,in a very great surprise.—No excuse, replied she, interrupting him, Iwill have it so, and thus she spoke in thetone of an Ogress, seeming to have a strongdesire to taste fresh meat; and to make thedish more delicious, added she, I will eat herwith Sauce Robert*1.* This is a i rench sause, made up with onions shred and boiledi tender in butter, to which are added, vinegar, mustard, salt, pepper,I and a little wine.14 THE SLEEPING BEAUTY ^This poor man, knowing very well howdanger ms it was to play tricks with Ogresses,took his great knife and went up into littleMorning’s chamber; she was then four yearsold, and came up to him jumping and laugh¬ing, to take him about the neck, and askedhim for some sugar candy; on wkich he be¬gan to weep, and the knife fell out of hishand, and he went into the back yard andkilled a little lamb, and dressed it with suchg'ood sauce that his mistress assured him, shehad never ate any thing so good in all her life.He had, at the same time, taken up littleMorning, and carried her-to his wife, in or¬der that she might be concealed in a lodginghe had at the bottom of the court-yard.The Queen’s lascivious appetite (accordingto her own apprehenson) being once hu¬moured, she again gan to long for anotherdainty bit; accordingly a few days after, shecalled for the clerk of the kitchen, and toldhim, that she intended that night to sup up¬on littie Day; he answered never a word, be¬ing resolved to cheat hei as he had done be¬fore. He went out to find little Day, andsaw him with a foil in his hand, with whichhe was fencing with a monkey, the child be¬ing but three years old: he took him up inhis arms, and carried him to his wife thatshe might conceal him in her cham beg along- with his sister, and in the room of little Day,cooked up a young kid, very tender, andIN THE WOOD.15which the Ogress praised as much as theformer, saying, It was wonderfully good.All hitherto* was mighty well, but a fewevenings after, this ciaving Ogress, said tothe clenk of the kitchen; I will also eat theyoung Queen with the same sauce that I hadwith her childrenNow was the critical time that the poorclerk despaired of being able to deceive her.The young Queen was turned of twentyyears of age (not counting the hundred shehad been asleep) though her skin was some¬what tough, yet fair and beautiful, and howto find a beast in the yard so firm,, was whatpuzzled him, and made him at a loss.hie then took a resolution, that he mustsave.his own life and cut the Queen’s throat;and going into her chamber, with an intentto do it at once, he put himself into as greata fury as he could, and went into the Queen’sroom, with his dagger in his hand. How¬ever, his humanity would not allow him tosurprise her, but he told her with a great dealof respect, the order he had received tromthe Queen her mother.Do it, said she, stretching out her neck,execute your orders, and then I shall go andsee my children whom I so dearly loved, forshe thought, them dead ever since they hadbeen taken from her.No, no, fair Princess, cried the humaneclerk of the Kitchen, all in tsars, you shall16 THE SLEEPING BEAUTYsse your children again, but then you shallgo with me to my lodgings, where I haveconcealed them, and I shall deceive theQueen once more, bv giving her anotheryoun^ kid in your stead.Upon this, he forthwith conducted her tohis chamber, where leaving her to embraceher children, and cry aloud with them, hewent and dressed a young kid, w tich theQueen had for supper, and devoured it withthe same appetite, as though it had been theyoung Queen.Now vas she exceedingly delighted withtbi unheard of cruelty, and she had inventeda story to tell the King at his return, howthe mad wolves had eaten up the Queen hiswife, with her two children.One evening some time after, as she was,according to her usual custom, rambling a-bout the court and yards of the palace, tosee if she could smell any fresh meat, sheheard in a ground room, little Day crying,for his mother was going to whip him, be¬cause he had been guilty of some fault, andshe heard at the same time, little Morningsoliciting for pardon for her brother.The Ogress presently knew the voice oithe Queen, and her children, and being quitein a rage to think she had been thus deceiv¬ed, she commanded, the next morning, bybreak of day, (in a most horrible voice, whichmade every one tremble) that th^y shouldIN THE WOOD.I1?bring into the middle of the great court avery large tub, v'hich she caused to be filledwith toads, vipers, snakes, and all sorts of, serpents, in order to have thrown into it theQueen and her children, the clerk of thekitchen, his wife and maid; all of whom shehad given orders to be brought thither withtheir hands tied behind them, to suffer thevengeance of the incensed Ogress.They were brought out accordingly, andthe executioners were going to throw theminto the tub, when the King fortunately en¬tered the court on horseback; and asked,with the utmost astonishment, what was thei meaning of this most horrible spectacle; no; one dared to tell him. When the Ogress,all enraged to 'see what had happened, threwherself, head foremost, into the tub, and wasinstantly devoured by the ugly creatures, shehad ordered to be thrown into it for others.The King could not but chuse being verysorry, for she was his Mother; but he sooncomforted himself with his beautiful wife,and his two pretty children. And, after allthings were settled, he well rewarded theclerk of the kitchen for his wisdom, human¬ity, and compassion.»; ,.ISTHE MORAL.TO get a husband, rich, gentle, and gay.Of humour sweet, sometime to stay,Is natural enough ’iis true;But then to wait an hundred years.And all the while asleep, appearsA thing intirely new.Now at this time of day,Not one in all the sex we see.To sleep with such sound tranquility.But yet this Fable seems to let us know.That very often Hymen’s bliss is sweet,Although some tedious obstacles they meet.Which makes us for them a long while to stayAnd not less happy for approaching slow.And that we nothing lose by such delay.But warm’d by nature's lambent fires,The sex so ardently aspires,Of this blest state the sacred joys to embrace.And with each earnest heart pursue ’em,I’ve not the will I must confess,Nor yet the power or fine address,To preach this Moral to ’em.THESTORYOFThe Envious Man, and himthat he Envied.TN a considerable town, two persons dweltnext doer to one another; one of themconceived such a violent hatred against thebther, that he who was hated resolved to re¬move his dwelling farther off, being persuad¬ed that their being neighbours was the onlyicause from whence his animosity did arise;ifor though he had done him several pieces ofiservice, he found nevertheless, that his hatred•was nothing diminished; therefore he soldihis house, with what goods he had left, andTetired to the capital city of that kingdom,which was not far distant. He bought a lit-’tle spot of ground which lay about half ajleague from the city; he had a house conven-lient enough, with a line garden, and a prettyspacious court, wherein was adeep well whichnot in use.. Jhe honest man, having made this pur¬chase, put on a dervise’s or monk’s habit, tolead a retired life, and caused several cells tobe made in the house, where, in a short time,ihe established a numerous society of dervises;I20 THE ENVIOUS MAN, ANDhe carr.e soon to be publicly known by hisvirtue, through which he acquired the esteemof a great many people, as well of the com¬monalty, as of the chief of the city. In short,he was extremely honoured and cherishedby every one. People came from afar tcrecommend themselves to his prayers; andall those who came to live with him publish¬ed what blessings they received through hismeans.The great reputation of this honest marhaving spread to the town from whence htcame, it touched the envious man so mudto the quick, that he left his house and affair:with a resolution to go and ruin him. Wittthis intent he went to the new convent o.dervises, of which his former neighbour wa;the head, who received him with all imaginable tokens of friendship. The envious martold him that he was come on purpose t*;communicate a business of importance to hirrwhich he could not do but in private; ancbecause that nobody shall hear us, let us, say:he, take a walk in your court, and seeingnight begins to draw on, command your dervises to retire to their cells. The head othe dervises did as he required.When the envious man saw that he was alone with this good man, he began to tell hinhis errand, walking side by side in the courtuntil he saw his opportunity; and getting tingood man near the brink of the well, he gav<21HIM THAT HE ENVIED.him a thrust, and pushed him into it with¬out any body being witness to so wicked anaction. Having done this, he marched offimmediately, got out at the gate of the con¬vent, without being known to any one, andcame home to his own house, well satisfieciwith his journey; being fully persuaded thatthe object of his hatred was no more in this! world, but found himself highly mistaken.This old well wras inhabited by fairies andgenies, which happened very luckily for therelief of the head of the convent; for theyreceived and supported him, carried him tothe bottom, so that he got no hurt. He per¬ceived well enough that there was somethingextracdinary in his fall, which must other¬wise have cost him his life; whereas he nei¬ther saw' nor felt any thing. But he soonheard a voice, which said, “Do you knowwhat honest man this is to whom we havedone this piece of servicer” Another voiceanswered, “No.” To which the first replied,“Then I will tell you. This man, out of,charity the greatest that ever was known,left the town he lived in, and has establishedhimself in this place, in hopes to cure one ofhis neighbours of the envy he had conceived. against him; he has acquired such general. esteem, that the envious ir an, not able to en¬dure it, came hither on purpose to ruin him,which he had performed, had it not been fcrthe assistance which we have given this ho-22 THE ENVIOUS MAN, ANDnest m?.n, whose reputation is so great, thatthe suitan, who keeps his residence in th&neighbouring city, was to pay him a visit to¬morrow, and to recommend the princess, Msdaughter, to his prayers.”Another voice asked, “ What need hadthe princess of the dervise’s prayers?” Towhich the first answered, s‘ You do not know,it seems, that she is pos^esed by Genie Mai-moun, the son of Dimdim, who is fallen inlove with her. But I know well how thisgood head of the dervises may cure her; thething is very easy, and I will tell it you. Hehas a black cat in his convent, with a whitespot at the end of her tail, about the bignessof a small piece of English money; let himonly pull seven hairs out of this white spot,burn them, and smoke the princess’s headwith the fume, she will not only be presentlycured, but be so safely delivered from Mai-moun, the son of Dimdim, that he will neverdare to come near her a second time.The head of the dervises remembered everyword of the discourse between the fairies andthe genies, who where very silent all the'night after. The next morning, by break ofday, when he could decern one thing fromanother, the well being broken down in se¬veral places, he saw a hole, by which he creptout with ease.The other dervises, who had been seekingfor him, were rejoiced to see him. He gave i23HIM THAT HE ENVIED.them a brief account of the wickedness ofthat man to whom he had given so kind areception the day before, and retired to hisceil. It was not long till the black cat, ofwhich thefairies and thegenies hadmademen-tion in their discourses thenfght before, cameto fawn upon her master, as she was accus¬tomed to do: he took her up, and pulled se-[ven hairs out of the white spot that was up¬on her tail, and laid them aside for his use,when occasion should serve.The sun was not high, when the sultan,who would leave no means untried that hethought could restore the princess to her per¬fect health, arrived at the gate of the convent.He commanded his guards to halt, whilst hewith his principal officers, went in. The der-yises received him with profound respect.i he sultan called their head aside, and says,“ GoodScheich, it may be, you knowalreadythe cause of my coming hither.” “ Yes Sir ”replies he very gravely, “ If I do not mistakeit, it is the disease of the princess which pro-I cures this honour that I have not deserved.”1 “ That is the very thing,” replied the sultan.“ You will give me new life, if your prayers,as I hope they will, can procure my daugh¬ter's health.” “ Sir,” said the good man, “ Ifyour Majesty will be pleased to let her comehither, 1 am in hopes, through God’s assis¬tance alid favour, she shall return in perfecthealth.”24THE ENVIOUS MAN, See,The prince, transported with joy, sent liramediately to fetch his daughter, who verrsoon appeared with a numerous train of lasdies and eunuchs, but masked, so that he>tface was not seen. The chief of the dervise jcaused a pall to be held over her head, ant';he had no sooner thrown the seven tufts ofhair upon the burning coals, but the genicMaimoun, the son of Dimdim, gave a grea-cry, without any thing being seen, and lefthe nrincess at liberty; upon which she tool*the veil from off her face, and rose up to secwhere she was, saying, “Where am I, uncwho brought me thither r” At these worckthe sultan, overcome with excess of joy, em¬braced his daughter, and kissed her eyes; he,also kissed the chief of the dervise’s hands,and said to his officers, “ Tell me your cpin-ion, what reward does he deserve who ha?thus cured my daughter?*’ They all cried, hadeserves her in marriage. “That is what Ihad in my thoughts,” said the sultan, “ and!I make him my son-in-law from this mo-jment.” Some time after, the prime visierdied, and the sultan conferred the place onthe dervise. The sultan himself died with¬out heirs-male; upon which the religious or¬der and the militia gathered together, and^the honest man was declared and acknow¬ledged sultan by general consent.FINIS.

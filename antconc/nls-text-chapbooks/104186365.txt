CALDWELL.—1 8 4 2.' "! ! ; • ,i- ■WIAtOf^UK.T. Weel John what Jo you think is to come out o’thae terrible times ? I believe our kintra neer saw a timelike this.J. Really they are fearfu’ looking times, and I amreally at a loss what to think about them, or how to pro¬pose a remedy to better them.T. Deed John I’m truly at a loss mysel’ to ken whatwould be the best remedy, but it is plain we would needsome remedy soon, for our miseries are every day increas¬ing, and the starvation and destitution that is amang usis alarming. Hae ye nae idea ava’ what can be thecause o’ a’ this bankruptcy and beggary that is comeamang us?J. It is often my first thochts in the morning, and the jlast at night, to fin’ out the origin o’ a’ this distress;whiles I think the Corn Bill has a great effect to hurt ourtrade, and I hae nae doubt but it has had a bad effect,but how far it would remedy the evil now I’m no very sure,for wi’ us no takin’ their Corn, they wouldna tak’ ourGoods, and noo baith Russia, and Prussia, and Holland,and Belgium, and France, and America, an’ a’, has got-?ten Cotton Mills, and Thread Mills, and lots o’ our Me¬chanics, and they are quite independent o’ us and our |goods. I think our landholders, if they had half an e'ein their head, micht see that.3T. L <!inna think ye’re far wiang Jolm, altljo' I haveheard some argue strictly in behalf o’ the Corn Bill, andtell us if it wasna the Corn Bill our grun’ wadna be saevveel cultivated, and its value wad sink in estimation, hutI rather think the lads up by are feart the rents wad sinkin their estimation; and is this a’the relief John—thetakin’ aff o’ the Corn Laws—that we hae to look for, forthe bettering o’ our condition? if this is a’ it is a veryforlorn hope.J. I hae nae doubt Thomas but there is ither causesthat produce these great grievances amang us. A it ithergreat cause, I believe, is our great National Debt, whichhangs about our neck like a millstane, and I’m afraidwill sink us to the bottom if the string is not cut, andwhat surprises me maist is to see sae little attention paidto economy, to help to pay off this debt. It is grievin’to read o’ the thousands, and thousands, and bunders o’thousands, that is payt awa’ every year to placemen andpensioners, for no purpose under the sun, but rankwastery: ane wad think, when they see our kintra sinkin’and sae muckle need for cafe, that they would be glad toadopt any plan to save us; and they ha’e a capital patterno’ cheap government laid down to them in America, wharthe head o’ the house costs them only £6000 instead o’£400,000, which some folk has to pay.'T I must confess John you talk very reasonably onthe subject, and if your plans could be brought to work,they micht hae a gude effect; but there is a heap o’ folkthinks that if we had the Charter it would work a won-derfu’ Reform amang us, and that we woald get a’ ourevils set to right in a short time, but I’m afraid it willnot he easy gotten to mak’ a trial o’.J. I daresay there would be a change, if that could hegotten, but, as ye say, I doubt it will not be gotten in ahurry, but I should like to see't try’t, and see what effectit wad hae to Reform matters; but there is ae Reform4that we a’ Lae in our power, and I think every living manand woman should mak* atrial o’t to see what effect itwad hse, there’s naebody 1 speak to but confesses thatthere is a world of evils in connection with it, and forthat reason I think it is our duly to try it, and that is toabstain from all intoxicating drinks, and 1 cannot thinkthat any man can be a sincere Chartist or Reformer, un¬less he be a Teetotaler, for the drinking o’ thae drinkscompletely counteracts Ids own schemes.I. Ah, noo John, are ye really gaun to tak a’ thehair o' comfort us puir bodies hae left? if it wasna for thedribble o’ dram I get noo and than, I wad sink un’er myaffliction athegither; ye canna deny I’m sure but it raisesthe spirits and roak’s us cheery mony a time, when naeither thing will do’t.J. O yes, Thomas, I must confess it raises the spirits,and that to an awfu’ degree, sometimes to 80, but nextmorning you will find them sink to 40, being 20 belowpar, and then what state do ye fin’ yoursel’ in ? do yefin’ your purse ony benter? do ye fin your head ony heal¬er? your character ony better, or your conscience onysounder, after wallowing in that sinfu’ drink? I trow no,Thomas. ,T. Tuts man ye’re takin’ the very warst look o’ thething ye can tak’; its weel enough kent there’s mony aaue tak’s a bit suck that disna drive themsel’s to thae ex¬tremities ye talk about, our Ministers, and Elders, andMagistrates, and Councillors too; indeed, the maist o’folk that reckon thcmsel’s upish can a’ tak’ their moder¬ate dram and no tin to excess.J. Their moderate dram ! dinna tell me about moder¬ate drams, I ken baith Ministers, and Elders, and Magis¬trates too, that hae gaen far aglee wi’ their moderation,but independent o’ a’ that, is’t no a shamfu’ bad examplethey set before workin’ folk, (for poor folk maun aye beimitating the rich if they can ava) to drink thae drinks5that destroy see rmickle o’ onr grain in times like this,w hen poor folk’s starvin’; every half mutehin ye drink,Thomas, believe me or no as ye like, destroys as mueklegude good as wad mak’ a comfortable meal to a gude bigfamily, and I’m creditably informed that there is as muchdestroyed in one dbtdlery every morning as wad break¬fast the hale town o’ Paisley.P. Hoot, nonsence, John ye’re surely gaun out o’t nooathegither, I never dream’t o’ ony thing like that, ye wadmaist fricht a body frae ever tasting a drap again ; if thatwas the case ye wad think the hale kintra wad rise up iua mass against it, our legislators wad stop distillation, andibur magistrates wad grant nae mae licenses. Hoot tootJohn, ye’re surly far wrangJ. No, tweel awat Thomas, I’m nane wrang, for ifthere was nane o’the drunkard's drink drucken, everynhabitant in Scotland micht hae sax pound o’ bread everytveek they hinna, and that’s but ae portion o’ the evil thatsprings frae that curse ; look to the misery and madness,,he woes and wretchedness, that it produces; we re tax’d;o a pretty degree even noo to support prisons like bastiles,svhereas if we wtd a’ drap drinking, a three-stoiey housevad ha’d a’ the criminals in a kintra side.,1. Ahho there a wheen fools that mak’ themsel’s idiotsvi drinkin , we re no a’ to be blamed wi’t; there’s mony1 decent respectable minister and magistrate baitli that tak’i heir dram, and disna fill themsel’s fou, and if foik wadmly imitate their example there wad be nae great fear o’;aun wrang.J. Ah, Thomas, Thomas, but it is a bad examplescripture aye approves o’ them that tak’ nae drink, andcould gie ye plenty o’ instances o’t if you and I hadime ; and to finish the whole story, it declares to you, inlabakuk, in plain terms no to he misunderstood, “ Woe3 him that giveth his neighbour drink.” The beginning6to drink ie somotbing like beginning to smoke or snuff, itis fun at first, but truly it often grows earnest, as we monya time see; and I think, for my part, its far bettei to letit alane a’ thegither; and I think it is the duty of eveiy,patriot and every Christian to give no countenance to thesevile things ; and every man that drinks intoxicating liquoris only assisting to support 4>0,000 men who break eveiyLord’s day, by destroying the bounties of Providence, 1)/converting them into a most destructive and perniciousidrink. And I think that a man that would not gie upthe use o’ a thing that is baith useless and unnecessary,for the sake o’ his suffering fellow creatures, is nae mamava.T. Ye really gang a great length wi’ your teetotalism,ye Seem to think it will he a general salve for a the dis¬tresses and sufferings with which we are afflicted; but 1doubt, John, tho’ we were a’ teetotlars the nicht, it wadnabetter our condition a bawbee, in the present awlu stateo’ things; we're gae an’ weed teetotal d the noo, and thatsair against our wills, ,J. Nae thanks to you for that kin’ o’ teetotahsm, that tno the genuine principle; besides, I am sure, if we wena’ pledged, and sterling to the cause, we wad soon see :different state o’ tilings, for 1 am quite convinced it wa«be a general salve for a’ our distresses. In the fiist placeit would prevent 45 millions bushels of good gram boabeing destroyed every year, which would have a giea,tendency to cheapen our food, enabling us to manmacturour goods at a cheaper rate, and to cope with other nations, and completely put a check to the evil workings clthe Corn Bill; and besides all this, the miseries amcrimes, the misfortunes and calamities, the lunacy amsuicide, the Sabbath desieration and a thousand other eviwould almost entirely vanish from among us.T. Really John, ye seem to hae’t a’ by the back, an;I must confess, there’s a good deal o’ truth in what y%Isay; but what wad bpcotne o’ our puir rovenue if wpwore a’ to drap drinking; tliero wad bo a bonny pry nutthen, for we hae facbt enough to get the win’ rais'd aa itis.J. Weel Thomas, to he plain wi’ you, I think thekintra is quite blin’ on that subject; I ken vera w^eel wehae great revenue aff drink, nae less than 16 millions, butfolk never think o’ the frightsome expense that thaeliquors bring on us, mair I believe, than a’ they produce.See the tremendous Jails, Hospitals, and Asylums we haeto support; see the Judges, the Sheriffs, the Fiscals, andthe awful army o’ Policemen we hae to pay; see theCriminals we hae to feed; the host o’ Witnpfses andLawyers which must be paid for prosecutions and trials;and the enormous sums levied from us in the characterof Rogue Money and Prison Money; see the thousandspaid for support of our criminal Colonies, for Freight ofVessels to send them to these Colonies no less than 86000peing paid last year for that purpose;—then say whetheror not our country is heneGtted try the revenue producedfrom these destructive drinks.T. I really must confess, John, you have almost mademe a Total Abstainer, and I do now consider it my dutyto give nae langer ony countenance to thae vile drinks;but I think we hae rather gaen aflf the point a w'ee; wewere talking about dull trade, and the causes o’t; yesurely dinna think that drinking has been the cause o’ saemony bankruptcies amang us, to crack our credit, derangeour business, and cause sic an unparalelled stagnation o’trade.J. Deed Thomas, I dinna think we were the least aflfthe point about the cause o’ our dull trade, for I hinnathe least doubt in my mind, but drinking is the cause o’a’ this wretchedness we’re labouring under; for, indepen¬dent o’ the great sums o’ money squandered awa’ on guz¬zling, and drinking, and gambling, which sums micht hae8keppit mony a Back Bill, I liae nae doakt hut mony o’ane o’ time Win' Bills were drawn and accepted under the .influence o’ the Bowl; and I am quite satisfled that if a’our trading men had been teetotalers for ten years back,there would neither have been dull trade nor bankruptciesamang us; and our present sufferings are only a just judge*ment for a’ our sinfu’ drinkings and horrid abominationsthat spring from that source; and so wide is the evileffects of the drinking system, that it has seized uponalmost every fibre of commerce, and so long as Alcoholicdrinks are encouraged and countenanced by the upperranks of society, and by our Ministers and Magistrates,J never expect to see things much better, for all classessink under its demoralizing influence. Our CabinetMinisters, our Pulpit Ministers, our highest gifted Liter¬ary Men, down to our humblest Artisans, all have suffer¬ed, all have gone astray through strong drink. I wishyou a good night, Thomas—I hope you’ll go to-morrowand sign the Pledge, and 1 trust we’ll soon see bettertimes.T. Good night John.

l^ HISTORYHISTORY OPOB, THELITTLE GLASS SLIPPER.TO WHICH IB ADDED, THEBABES IN THE WOOD.I/V:T:; . !W.- , , yCINDERELLA,OB, THELITTLE GLASS SLIPPER.—“>eeioi®e«a»—Ihere was once a very rich gentleman writjjcst his wife; and having loved her exceed¬ingly, he was very sorry when she died.Finding himself quite unhappy for her loss,le resolved to marry a second time, think-;;ng by this means he should be as happy asbefore. Unfortunately, however, the ladyle chanced to fix upon was the proudest and|>st haughty woman ever known; she wasivays out of humour with every one; nobodyaid please her, and she returned the civil-es of those about her with the most affront-g disdain. She had two daughters by armer husband, whom she brought up to beoud and idle: indeed, in temper and be-iviour they perfectly resembled their mo-er; they did not love their books, anomid not learn to work; in short, they werel isliked by every body.The gentleman on his side too had ?L aughter, who, in sweetness of temper anddamage, was the exact likeness of her owr4mother, whose death he had so much lament¬ed, and whose tender care of the little girlhe was in hopes to see replaced by that of hisnew bride.But scarcely was the marriage ceremony !over, before his wife began to show her real 1temper; she could not bear the pretty little Igirl, because her sweet obliging mannersmade those of her own daughters appear athousand times the more odious and disagree¬able.She therefore ordered her to live in thekitchen; and, if ever she brought any thinginto the parlour, always scolded her till shewas out of sight. She made her work withthe servants, in washing the dishes, andrubbing the tables and chairs: it was herplace to clean madam’s chamber, and thatof the misses her daughters, which was allinlaid, had beds of the newest fashion, andlooking-glasses so long and broad, that theysaw themselves from head to foot in them;while the little creature herself was forced tosleep up in a sorry garret, upon a wretchedstraw bed, without curtains, or any thing tomake her comfortable.The poor child bore all this with the great¬est patience, not daring to complain to herfather, who, she feared, would only reproveher, for she saw that his wife governed himentirely. When she had done all her work5she used to sit in the chimney corner amongthe cinders; so that in the house she wentby the name of Cinderbreech : the youngestof the two sisters, however, being rathermore civil than the eldest, called her Cinder¬ella. And Cinderella, dirty and ragged asshe was, as often happens in such cases, wasa thousand times prettier than her sisters,'Jrest out in all their splendour.It happened hat the kings son gave aball, to which ire invited all the persons offashion in the country : our two misses wereof the number; for the king’s son did notknow how disagreeable they "were ; but sup¬posed, as they were so much indulged, thatthey were extremely amiable. He did notinvite Cinderella, for he had never seen orheard of her.The two sisters began immediately to bevery busy in preparing for the happy day:nothing could exceed their joy; everymoment of their time was spent m fancyingsuch gowns, shoes, and head-dresses aswould set them off to the greatest advantage.All this was new vexation to poor Cinder¬ella, for it was she who ironed and plaitedher sisters’ muslins. They talked of nothingbut how they should be dressed. u I,” saidthe eldest, “ will wear my scarlet velvet withFrench trimming.” u And I,” said theyoungest, “ shall wear the same petticoat I6had made for the last ball: but then to makeamends fdf that, I shall put on my goldmuslin train, and wear my diamonds in myhair; with these I must certainly look well. ”They sent several miles for the best hair¬dresser that was to be had, and all theirornaments were bought at the most fashion¬able shops.On the morning of the ball they calledup Cinderella to consult with her about theirdress, for they knew she had a great deal oftaste. Cinderella gave them the best adviceshe eoidd, and even offered to assist theiiiin adjusting their head-dresses ; which wasexactly what they wanted, and they accord¬ingly accepted her proposals.While Cinderella was busily engaged indressing her sisters, they said to her,u Should you not like, Cinderella, to go tothe ball?” 4‘Ah!” replied Cinderella, “ youare only laughing at me; it is not for suchas I am to think of going to balls.” “Youare in the right,” said they : “ folks mightlaugh indeed to see a Cinderbreech dancingin a ball-room.”Any other than Cinderella would havetried to make the haughty creatures look asugly as she could; but the sweet-temperedgirl, on the contrary, did every thing shecould think of to make them look well.The sisters had scarcely eaten any thing[7for two days, so great was tn^lr joy as thehappy day drew near. More than a dozen; laces were broken in endeavouring to givethem a fine slender shape, and they were: always before the looking-glass.At length the much-wished-for moment. arrived: the proud misses stepped into a beau-; tiful carriage1, and followed ly servants ini rich liveries, drove towards the palace.I Cinderella followed them with her eyes as! far as she could; and when they were outI of sight, she sat down in a corner and beganto cry.I Her godmother, who saw her in tears,asked what ailed her. “I wish 1w-i-s-h—,” sobbed poor Cinderella withoutbeing able to say another word.The godmother who was a fairy, said toher, “You wish to go to the ball, Cinderella;i is not this the truth?” “ Alas ! yes,” re¬plied the poor child, sobbing still more thanbefore. “Well, well, be a good girl,” saidthe godmother, “ and you shall go.”She then led Cinderella to her bed-I chamber, and said to her, “ Run into thegarden and bring me a pumpion.” Cinder¬ella few like lightning, and brought the finestshe could lay hold of. Her godmother scoop¬ed out the inside, leaving nothing but therind; she then struck it with her wand, andthe pumpion instantly became a fine coach'8gilded all over with gold. She next looket t.into her mousetrap, where she found si> t:mice all alive and brisk: she told Cindcrelk t.to lift up the door of the trap very gently; antas the mice passed out, she touched them oneby one with her wand, and each immediatelybecame a beautiful horse of a fine dapplogrey mouse-colour. “Here, my child, tsaid the godmother, u is a coach and horse ]too, as handsome as your sisters’: but whatshall we do for a postilion ?”“ I will run,” replied Cinderella, “andsee if there be not a rat in the rat-trap; ifI find one, he will do very well for a pos-ltilion.”“Well thought of, my child.!” said hergodmother; “ make what haste you can.”Cinderella brought the rat-trap, which toher great joy, contained three of the largestrats ever seen. The fairy chose the onewhich had the longest beard, and touchinghim with her wand, he was instantly turned jinto a smart handsome postilion, with thefinest pair of whiskers imaginable.She next said to Cinderella, “Go againinto the garden, ana you will find six liz¬ards behind the waiermg-pot; bring themhither.” This was no sooner done, than, witha stroke from the fairy’s wand, they werechanged into six footmen, who all immeafely jumped up behind the coach inPlaced liveries, and stood side by side asI cleverly as if they had been used to nothingelse the whole of their lives.The fairy then said to Cinderella, “Well,my dear, is not this such an equipage as yoincould wish for to take you to the ball ? Art1 you not delighted with it ?” “Y-e-s,” re-f plied Cinderella with hesitation ; “ but mustI I go hither in these filthy rags ?”Her godmother touched her with the wand.I and her rags instantly became the mostmagnificent apparel, ornamented with themost costly jewels in the whole world. Tothese she added a beautiful pair of glitssslippers, and bade her set out for thepalace.The fairy, however, before she took leave> of Cinderella, strictly charged her on noit account whatever to stay at the ball after; the clock had struck twelve; telling herthat, should she stay but a single momentafter that time, her coach would again be¬come a pumpion, her horses mice, her foot¬men lizards, and her fine clothes be changedd to filthy rags.Cinderella did not fail to promise all hergodmother desired of her; and, almost wild 'with joy, drove away to the palace.As soon as she arrived, the king’s son,who had been informed that a great princesswhom nobody knew, was come to the ball.10presented himself at the door of the carnage,!helped her out, and conducted her to thHball-room.Cinderella no sooner appeared than everyone was silent; both the dancing and themusic stopped, and every body was employedin gazing at the uncommon beauty of thisunknown stranger: nothing was heard butwhispers of C( How handsome she is !” Theking himself, old as he was, could not keephis eyes from her, and continually repeatedto the queen, that it was a long time sincehe had seen so lovely a creature. The ladiesendeavoured to find out how her clothes tveremade, that they might get some of the samepattern for themselves by the next dpy,should they be lucky enough to meet #5thsuch handsome materials, and such goodwork-people to make them.The king’s son conducted her to the mosthonourable seat, and soon after took her outto dance with him. She both moved anddanced so gracefully, that every one admiredher still more than before, and she wasthought the most beautiful and accomplishedlady ever beheld.After some time a delicious collation wasserved up: but the young prince was sobusily employed in looking at her, that ludid not eat a morsel.Cinderella seated herself near her sisters,11paid them a thousand attentions, and offeredthem a part of the oranges and sweatmeatswith which the prince had presented her;while they on their part were quite astonish¬ed at these civilities from a lady whom theydid not know.As they were conversing together, Cin¬derella heard the clock strike eleven and threequarters: she rose from her seat, curtsiedto the company, and hastened away as fastas she could.As soon as she got home she flew to hergodmother, and, after thanking her a thou¬sand times, told her she would give the worldto be able to go again to the ball the nextday, for the king’s son had entreated her tobe there.Vv hile she was telling her godmotherevery thing that had happened to her at theball, the two sisters knocked a loud rat-tat-tat at the door, which Cinderella opened.“ How late you have staid!” said she,yawning, rubbing her eyes, and stretchingherself as if just awaked out of her sleep,though she had in truth felt no desire tosleep since they left her.“ If you had been at the ball,” said oneof the sisters, 1 (let me tell you, you wouldnot have been sleepy: there came thitherthe handsomest, yes, the very handsomestprincess ever beheld ! She paid us a thousand12attentions, and made us take a part of theoranges and sweatmeats the prince had giventier.”Cinderella could scarcely contain herselftor joy: she asked her sisters the name ofthis princess: to which they replied, thatnobody had been able to discover who shewas; that the king’s son was extremelygrieved on that account, and had offered alarge reward to any person who could findout where she came from.Cinderella smiled, and said, (e How verybeautiful she must be! How fortunate youare! Ah, could I but see her for a singlemoment! Dear Miss Charlote, lend me onlythe yellow gown you wear everyday, andlet me g-o and see her.”“Oh! yes, I warant you; lend myclothes to a Cinderbreech! Do you reallysuppose me such a fool? No, no; pray,Miss Forward, mind your proper business,and leave dress and balls to your betters.”Cinderella expected some such answer,and wTas by no means sorry, for she wouldhave been sadly at a loss what to do if hersister had lent her the clothes that she askedof her.The next day the two sisters again appearedat the ball, and so did Cinderella, but dressedmuch more magnificently than the night be¬fore. The king’s son avus continually by h13! side, and said the most obliging things toher imaginable.The charming young creature was farfrom being tired of all the agreeable thingsshe met with : on the contrary, she was sodelighted with them, that she entirely for-1 got the charge her godmother had givenher.Cinderella at last heard the striking of as clock, and counted one, two, three, on tillshe came to twelve, though she had thought, that it could be but eleven at most. Shegot up and flew as nimbly as a deer out ofi the ball-room.The prince tried to overtake her ; butCinderella’s fright made her run the faster.However, in her great hurry, she droppedone of the little glass slippers from herfoot, which the prince stooped down andpicked up, and took the greatest care of itpossible.Cinderella got home tired and out ofbreath, in her dirty old clothes, withouteither coach or footman, and having nothingleft of her magnificence but the fellow of theglass slipper which she had dropped.In the meanwhile, the prince had enquiredof all his guards at the palace gates, if theyhad not seen a magnificent princess pass out,and which way she went ? The guards re¬plied, that no princess had passed the gates,14and that they had not seen a creature huta little ragged girl, who looked more likea heggar than a princess.\V hen the two sisters returned from theball, Cinderella asked them if they had beenas much amused as the night before, and ifthe beautiful princess had been there ? Theytold her that she had; but that as soon asthe clock struck twelve she hurried awayfrom the ball-room, and in the great hasteshe made, had dropped one of her glassslippers, winch was the prettiest shape thatcould be; that the king’s son had picked itup, and had done nothing but looked at it allthe rest of the evening; and that every bodybelieved he was violently in love with thehandsome lady to whom it belonged.This was very true; for a few days after,die prince had it proclaimed by sound oftrumpet, that he would marry the lady whosefoot should exactly fit the slipper he hadfound.Accordingly the prince’s messengers tookthe slipper, and carried it first to all theprincesses ; then to the duchesses : in short,to all the ladies of the court,—but withoutsuccess.They then brought it to the two sisters,who each tried all she could to squeeze herfoot into the slipper, but saw at last that thiswas quite impossible.15Cinderella, who was looking at them allthe while, and knew her slipper, could notI help smiling, and ventured to say, u Pray,sir, let me try to get on the slipper.”Her sisters burst out a laughing in therudest manner possible:—“very likely,truly,” said one of them, “ that such aclumsy foot as your’s should fit the slipper ofa beautiful princess.”The gentleman, however, who broughtthe slipper, turned round, looked at Cinder-I ella, and observing that she was very hand-| some, said, that as he was ordered by the| prince to try it on every one till it fitted, itp was but just that Cinderella should have her1 turn.Saying this, he made her sit down; andjj putting the slipper to her foot, it instantly!• slipped in, and he saw that it fitted her likeitf. wax.I The two sisters were amazed to see thatthe slipper fitted Cinderella: but how much(greater was their astonishment, when shedrew out of her pocket the other slipper andH put it on !Just at this moment the fairy entered the| room, and touching Cinderella’s clothes withher wand, made her all at once appear morenl magnificently dressed than they had seen herB before.The two sisters immediately perceived16that she was the beautiful princess they hadseen at the ball. They threw themselves ather feet, and asked her forgiveness for theill treatment she had received from them.Cinderella helped them to rise, and, tenderlyembracing them, said that she forgave themwith all her heart, and begged them to be¬stow upon her their affection.Cinderella was then conducted, drest asshe was, to the young prince, who findingher more beautiful than ever, instantlydesired her to accept of his hand.The marriage ceremony took place in afew days; and Cinderella, who was as ami¬able as she was handsome, gave her sistersmagnificent apartments in the palace, anda short time after married them to two greatlords of the courtTHE ENDTHEBABES IN THE WOOD.A great many years ago, there lived inthe county of Norfolk a gentleman and hislady. The gentleman was brave, generous,and honourable ; and the lady gentle, beau-tiful, and virtuous : they were beloved by allwho knew them, and were blessed with twochildren, a boy and a girl. The boy wasonly about three years old, and the girl notquite two, when the gentleman was seizedwith a dangerous malady,, and the lady, inattending her beloved husband, caught thecontagion. Notwithstanding every medicalassistance their disorder daily increased, andas they expected to be soon snatched awayfrom their little babes, they sent for thegentleman’s brother, and gave the darlingsinto his care.i( Ah! brother,” said the dying man,u you see I have but a short time to live;yet neither death nor pain can pierce myheart with half so much anguish as what Ifeel at the thought of that these dear babeswill do without a parent’s care. Brotherthey will have none but you to be land tothem, to see them clothed and fed, and toteach them to be good.”18” Dear, dear brother,” said the dying Ilady, “ you must be father, mother, and Puncle too, to these dear innocent lambs. First |let William be taught to read; and then heshould be told how good his father was. Iind little Jane, — Oh! brother, it wringsmy heart to talk of her; think of the gentleusage she will need, and take her fondly onyour knee, brother, and she and William toowill pay your care with lore.”u How does it grieve my heart to see you,my dear relatives, in this mournful con¬dition! replied the uncle. u But be com-forted, there may yet be hopes of your well¬doing : but should we have the misfortuneto lose you, f will do all you can desire foryour darling children. In me they shalllind father, mother, and uncle; but, dearbrother, you have said nothing of yourwealth.” u H-e-r-e, h-e-r-e, brother, repliedhe, is my will, in winch I have provided formy dear babes.”The gentleman and his lady then kissedtheir children, and a short time after theyboth died.The uncle, after sheding a few tears,opened the will, in which he found, that toWilliam was bequeathed three hundredpounds a-year, when he became of age, andto little Jane five hundred pounds in gold onher marriage day. But if the children19should chance to die l '' ’ ^their uncle. The will of the unfortunategentleman next desired, that he and his be¬loved wife should be buried side by side inthe same grave.The two little innocents were now takento the bouse of their uncle, who, for sometime, recollecting what their parents said sosorrowfully upon their death-bed, behaved tothem with great kindness. But when hehad kept them about a twelvemonth, he bydegrees forgot to think both how theirparents looked when they gave their childrento his care, and the promises he made to betheir father, mother, and uncle, all in one.After a little more time had passed, theuncle could not help thinking that he wishedthe little boy and girl would die, for he shouldthen have all their wealth for himself; andwhen he had begun to think this, he wenton till he could think scarcely of anything else; and at last, says he to himself,It will not be very difficult for me to killthem, so as nobody knows any thing of thematter, and then, their gold is mine.When the barbarous uncle had oncebrought his mind to kill the helpless littlecreatures, ^he was not long in finding* a wayto execute his cruel purpose. He hired twovturdy ruffians, who had already killed manythen all their wealth20travellers in a dark thick wood, at some dis-1tance, and then robbed them of their money. |These two wicked creatures agreed, for alarge reward, to do the blackest deed thatever yet was heard of; and the uncle beganto prepare every thing accordingly.He told an artful story to his wife, ofwhat good it would be to put the childrenforward in their learning ; how he had a re¬lation in London who would take the great¬est care of them. He then said to the inno¬cent children, i( Should you not like, mypretty ones, to see the famous town ofLondon, where you, William, can buy a finewooden horse to ride upon all day long, and awhip to make him gallop, and a fine swordto wear by your side ? And you, Jane, shall <have pretty dolls, and pretty pincushions,and a nice gilded coach shall be got to takeyou there.”(C Oh, yes, I will go, uncle,” saidWilliam, “ Oh, yes, I will go, uncle,” saidJane; and the uncle, with a heart of stonesoon got them ready for their journey.The unsuspecting little creatures were afew days after put into a finecoach, and withthem the two inhuman butchers, who weresoon to end their joyful prattle, and turntheir smiles to tears. One of them servedas coachman, and the other sat between littl?William and little Jane.21When they had reached the entrance to thedark thick wood, the two ruffians took themout of the coach, telling them they mightnow walk a little way, and gather flowers;and, while the children were skipping aboutlike lambs, the ruffians turned their backson them, and began to consult about whatthey had to do.u In good truth,” says the one who hadbeen sitting all the way between the children,a now I have seen their cherub faces, andheard their pretty speech, I have no heartto do the bloody deed; let us fling away theugly knife, and send the children back totheir uncle.” u That I will not,” says theother; “what boots their pretty speech tous? And who will pay us for being sochicken-hearted ?”At last the ruffians fell into so great apassion about butchering the innocent littlecreatures, that he who wished to spare theirlives, suddenly opened the great knife hehad brought to kill them, and stabbed theother to the heart, so that he fell downdead.The one who had killed him was nowgreatly at a loss what to do with the child¬ren, for he wanted to get away as fast as hecould, for fear of being found in the wood.He was not, however, long in determiningthat he must leave them in the wood, to thachance of some traveller passing by. “ Loo-ye, my pretty ones,” said he, “ you musteach take hold and come along with me.”The poor children each took a hand, andwent on, the tears bursting from their eyes,nd their little limbs trembling with fear.Thus did he lead them about two milesfurther on in the wood, and then told themto wait there till he came back with somecakes.William took his sister Jane by the hand,and they wandered fearfully up and down thewood. “ Will the strange man come withsome cakes, Billy?” says Jane, u Presently,dear Jane,” says William. And soon again,<£ I wish I had some cakes, Billy,” saidshe; and it would have melted a heart of stoneto have seen how sorrowfully they looked.After waiting very long, they tried tosatisfy their hunger with black-berries; butthey soon devoured all that were within theirreach; and night coming on, William, whohad tried all he could to comfort his littlesister, now wanted comfort himself; so whenJane said once more, “ How hungry I am,Billy, I b-e-l-i-e-v-e I cannot help crying,”—William burst out crying too; and downthey lay upon the cold earth, and puttingtheir arms round each other’s neck, thereihey starved, and there they died.hus were these pretty little innocentsi murdered; and as no one knew of their death;so no ope sought to give them burial. ,The wicked uncle, supposing they hadbeen killed as he desired, told all who askedafter them an artful tale of their having diedin London of the small pox; and accordinglytook possession openly of their fortune.all this did him very little service, foiinon after his wife died; and being very un-liappy, and always thinking too that he sawj'he bleeding innocents before his eyes, heneglected all his business; so that, instead ofFro wing richer, he every day grew poorer.His two sons, also, who had embarked for aforeign land, were both drowned at sea, andi|ie became completely miserable.When things had gone on in this mannerfor years, the ruffian who took pity on thechildren, committed another robbery in theivood, and being pursued by some men, hevas laid hold of, and brought to prison, andioon after was tried at the assizes, and foundpiilty—so that he was condemned to betanged for the crime.As soop as he found what his unhappy endnust be, he sent for the keeper of the prison,md confessed to him all the crimes he hadteen guilty of in his whole life, and thusleclared the story of the pretty innocents ;elliug him at the same time, in what parttf the wood he had left them to starve.24The news of the discovery he had madsoon reached the uncle’s ears; who beinalready broken-hearted for misfortunes thahad befallen him, and unable to bear the loof public shame that could not but awaihim, lay down upon his bed and died thavery day.No sooner were the tiding-s of the fate othe two children made public, than proppersons were sent to search the wood; whenafter many fruitless endeavours, the prett;babes were at length found stretched in eacother’s arms, with William’s arm round thneck of Jane, his face turned close to her’sand his frock pulled over her body. Thewere covered all over with leaves, which iall that time never withered; and on a bus!near this cold grave a Robin-Redbreaswatched and chirped : so that many gentlhearts still think that pretty bird did brinthe leaves which made their grave.A

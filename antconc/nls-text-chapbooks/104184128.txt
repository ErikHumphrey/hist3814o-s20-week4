S. with his wife and family,consisting of a son of twelve years old, a daugh¬ter fourteen, two maid servants, a female negroslave, and George Pine his book-keeper, onboard one of the said ships, called the East IndiaMerchant, of four hundred and fifty tons, beingprovided with all manner of necessaries antconveniences, in order to settle a factorythere.By the i 1th of May, they were in sight of thCanaries ; and soon after arrived at the Cape da4Verd Islands, where they took in some provisionslor their voyage, and steering their course southand a point east, about the 1st of August cameto the island, St. Helena; and having taken insome fresh water, set forward tor the Cape ofGood Hope, where by God’s blessing they arri¬ved safe, having hitherto met with no tempestu¬ous or disagreeable sailing weather.But it pleased God, when they were almostin sight of St. Lauranee (said to be one of thelargest islands in the world) they were overtakenby a great storm of wind, which separated themirom the rest of the ships, and continued withsuch violence for many days, that, being drivenout of their knowledge, they lost all hopes ofsafety.The 1st of October, about break of day, thesea continued very stormy and tempestuous, theydiscovered land, which appeared high and rocky,and the nearer they approached to it, their fearsincreased, expecting the ship would suddenlybe dashed to pieces. The captain, therefore, Mr.English, and some others, got into the long-boatin hopes, by that means, to save themselves; andpresently after all the sailors cast themselvesover-board, endeavouring to save themselves byswimming; but probably they all parished inthe sea.Mr. Pine, Mr. English's daughter, the twomaid servants, and negro girl, were the onlvpersons remaining on board the ship; and thesefive persons were miraculously preserved : for,after the ship had beat three or four times again¬st the rocks, being now broken, and quite found¬ered in the water, they had with great difficultygotten themselves on the bowsprit, which beingbroken off, was driven by the waves into a smallcreek, wherein fell a little river, which beingencompassed by the rocks, was shattered fromthe winds, so that they had an opportunity,though almost quite spent, to land themselves.Mr. Pine getting together some rotton wood,by the assistance of a tinder-box he had in hispocket, made a fire, by which they dried them¬selves; and then leaving the females, he went tosee if he could find any of the ship's companythat possibly might have escaped, but could findnone. At length, it drawing towards evening,he, with what he could get from the wreck, re¬turned to his fellow sufferers, who were verymuch troubled for want of him, he being now ailtheir support in this lost condition.They were afraid that the wild people of thecountry (if there were any) might find them out,but could distinguish neither foot-steps norpathsAnd thewToods round about thorn beingall fullof briers and brambles, they apprehended toothere might be wild beasts toannoy them, thoughthey saw no marks of any. But above all, forwant of food, they were afraid of being starved todeath; but God had otherwise provided forthem.The wreck of the ship furnished them withmany necessaries; for, getting together somebroken pieces of boards and planks, sails andrigging, with the help of poles they made them¬selves tents; and having got wood for firing, andthree or four sea gowns to cover them, makingthe negro their centry, they slept soundly allnight, having been without sleep for severalnights before.The next day, after being well refreshed withsleep, the wind ceasing, and the weather beingwarm, they went down from the rocks on thesands at low-water, where they found a great partof the ship’s lading, either on shore or floatingnear it. Mr. Pine, with the help of his com¬panions, dragged most of it on shore : and whatwas too heavy for them, they broke: and, un¬binding the casks and chests, and taking out thegoods, they secured all; so that they wantedneither cloaths, nor other necessaries for house¬keeping. But the salt water had spoiled all thevictuals except one cask of biscuit, which beinglighter, and perhaps better secured than the restwas undamaged; this served them for bread awhile; and a fowl, about the bigness of a swan,very heavy and fat, which by reason of itsweight could not fly, served them for presentsubsistance. The poultry of the ship, by somemeans getting ashore, bred exceedingly, andwere a great help to them. They found also inthe flags, by a little river plenty of eggs offowl, much like our ducks, which were verynourishing food, so that they wanted for nothingto keep them alive.Mr. Pine being now less apprehensive of anything to disturb him, looked out for a con¬venient place to build a hut to shelter him andhis family from the weather; and, in about aweek’s time, made a room large enough to holdthem all, and their goods; and put up hamocksfor his family to sleep in.Having lived in this manner full four months,8without seeing or hearing any thing to disturbthem, they found the land they were in poss¬ession of, to be an island disjoined, and out ofsight of any other land, uninhabited by anybut themselves, and that there was no hurtfulbeast to annoy them. But, on the contrary, thecountry was very pleasant, being always clothedin green, and full of agreeable fruits, and var¬iety of birds, ever warm, and never colder thenin England in September; so that this place(had it the culture that skilful people mightbestow on it) would prove a paradice1The woods afforded them a sort of nuts asbig as large apples; whose kernel being plea¬sant and dry, they made u e of instead of bread,together with the fowl before mentioned, anda sort of water-fowl like ducks, and their eggs;and a beast about the size of a goat, and almostlike such a creature, which brought forth twoyoung ones at a time, and that twice a year, ofwhich the lowlands and woods are very full;and being harmless and tame, they could easilytake and kill them;fish also, especially shell-fish,were in great plenty; so that, in effect theywanted nothing of food for subsistance.After being fn possession of this country full9six months, nature put them in mind of the greatcommand of the Almighty to our first parents,as if they had been conducted thither by thehand of Providence, to people a new world;and in this respect they proved not unfruitful,for, in less than a twelvemonth from their firstarrival in this island, the females proved all tobe with child, and coming at different seasons,they were a great help to one another. Thewomen had all their teemings annually, and thechildren proved strong and healthy. Theirfamily increasing, they were now well satisfiedwith their condition, for there was nothing tohurt them. The warmth of the climate madeit agreeable for them to go abroad sometimes,and they reposed themselves on mossy banksshaded by trees. Mr. Pine made several plea¬sant arbours for him and his women to sleep induring the heat of the day, and in these theypassed their time together, the females not lik¬ing to be out of his company.Mr Pine’s family was increased, after he hadlived in this island sixteen years, to forty-sevenchildren ; for his first wife brought him thirteen;his second, seven, his master’s daughter whoseemed to be his greatest favourite, fifteen;10and the negro, twelve, which was all the pro¬duce of’ the first race of mortals in this island.Thinking it expedient to provide for anothergeneration, he gave his eldest son a mate; andtook care to match the rest as fast as they grewup and were capable. And, least they shouldincommode one another, he, appointed his sonshabitation at some distance from him; for grow¬ing in years, he did not like the annoyance ofyoung company.After having lived to the sixtieth year of hisage, and the fortieth of his being in possessionof this island, he summoned his whole peopletogether, children, grand-children, and great-grand-children; amounting to five hundred andsixty-five of all sorts. He took the males ofone family, and married them to the females ofanother, not permitting any to marry theirsisters, as they did at first out of necessity.Having taught some of his children to read,he laid them under an injunction to read theBible once a month at their general meetings.Three of his wives being dead, viz. the negrowoman, and the other who had been maid ser¬vants to his master, she who was his master'sdaughter, survived them twelve years.11They were buried in a place he had set asideon purpose, fixing for his own interment themiddle part, so that two of his wives might lieon eacli side, next to him.Arriving to the eightieth year of his age, andsixtieth of coming to this island, he called hispeople together a second time, the number ofwhich amounted then to one thousand sevenhundred and eighty nine : and having informedthem of the manners in Europe, and chargedthem to remember the Christian religion, afterthe manner of those who spoke the same lan¬guage, and to admit of no other, if they shouldcome and find them out; and praying to God,to continue the multiplication of them, and sendthem the true light of his Gospel, he dismissedthem.He called this island the Isle of Pines, andgave the people descended from him, the nameof the English Pines, distinguishing the tribesof the particular desendants by his wives names,the Englishes, the Sparkses, the Trevors, andthe Phillis, phillippa being the name of thenegro.Being now very old and his sight decaying, hegave his habitation and furniture that was left,12to his eldest son after his decease; made himking and governor of the rest; and deliveredhim the history of these transactions writen withhis own hand, commanding him to keep it; andif any strangers should come hither by any ac¬cident, to let them see it, and take a copy of italso if they pleased, that the name of his peoplemight not be lost from oft'the earth.It happened in the year 1667, Corneilus VanSloetten, captain of a Dutch ship, called theAmsterdam, was driven by foul weather to thisisland, where he found the prosterity of Mr.Pine, speaking good English, and amounting,as it was supposed, to ten or twelve thousandpersons.The narrative, from which this account is takenwas given by Mr. Pine’s grandson to the Dutchcaptain.

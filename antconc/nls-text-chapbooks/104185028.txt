sad news, L—d, I am done!My kail an‘ brose will now boil thin;My gude auld breeks, that I hae wornThese lang sax years ; see how they re torn!I ettled week some o‘ thir days,To haen a suit o‘ gude new clai s;An‘ the first time [ gaed to town,I vras to buv my Meg a Gown,Wi‘ a new fashion'd gude black Straw,To gar her ay look trig an‘ braw :' But Maggy she maun wear her Maunky*\Vi‘ her au’d hood, coft by her aunty,Her ragged coats and mutch to hide,When I took her to be my bride.• The bunker Meg maun just turn cut,An‘ rang't a’ thro’ to get a clout,My auld breeks an!

yonder comes my Itcv'ren Willie,E'en riding on his ain black Fillie;Sae here nae langer I can stay,Now, Jamie, fare-ye-weel the dayiThis very night, when it is late.I'll see you, an- my plans relate.Then each got up, an‘ tuke the read,Wi‘ hearts haith sorrowfV an£ sad;But sairer vext they wou!d hae been,Ayont the dyke had they me seen,Where I fay snug, just at their back,Till Rev'ren* Willie stcpt their crack.But still bein' keen to hear his scheme,I up, and steer'd my course right hame;And waited till the clock struck nine,When I thought it was near the time,That they again would baith forgather,An‘ tell their minds to ane-anither;Then I set out, and took my placeFJght opposite to Jamie's house.But scarcely was I weel set down,Till Johnnie cam’—the faithless loun.Then to the door astld Jamie ran,An’ cry’d, You’re welcome, honest man!They baith went in—O'er ale an gin,I trow they did their crack begin.But o‘ their plan I am na sure,I was sae far plac'd frae the door.They tarry’d lang ere they came out,But kendna, I was thereabout,Jinkin' aroun’, to hear their cracks,About their horrid sinfu' acts;They were sae vogie, and sae nappie.That they were just a wee o'er crackie.It then struck me, they did intendTheir course to some Kirk-yard to bend,Where they would work their awful wark,And get ane lifted in the dark,Safely to Embro’ it to send.To serve their drgadful hellish end IBut happy was I, when I knewWhat way they did intend to do.Tttis is my scheme, did Johnnie say.And, Jasnie, telld to n ine, I pray:Some day, ere Ian£, L‘il hire a Gig,And play them a most desp rate rig;At Falkirk twa men in!t will gang,At Lauriestoun ane out will bang.Then tik‘ his heels—rin East or West,Whatever way that he thinks best.What way they re treated [ will ken,That I may carry pn my plan.Some after’t, nae doubt will rin quick,Never suspecting it a trick ;They then will seiz't, but naetbing find,To please them, as they'd hae a mind.Then alter that, I think, we mayWi‘ safety get them sent away,An’ live fu’ happy, while we’re here ;Now, Jamie, fare ye-weel, my clear.Now, every one be on your guard.And watch,in earnest your Kirk yard;That there the dead may safely lye.Until they’re summon'd frae on high.F I N 1 8.

He made nothing but such ascanvass for caff-beds, corn and coalsacks, drugget and harn was the finestwebs he could lay his fingers to: he wasa great lump of a lang, lean lad, aboonsax feet afore he was aughteen yearsauld; and, as he said himsel, he grewsae fast, and was in sic a hurry to behigh, that he did not stay to bring a’his judgment with him, but yet hehoped it would follow him, and hewould meet wi’t, as mony a ane does3after they’re married. He had but aesister, and she had as little sense ashimsel’, she was married on Sleeky Wil¬lie, the wylie weaver; his mither was arattling rattle-scull’d wife, and they liv¬ed a’ in ae house, and every body heldthem as a family of tools. When Johncame to man’s estate, to the a^e oitwenty-one years, he told his mitherhe would hae a wife o‘ some sort, eitheryoung or auld, widow or lass, if theyhad but heads and lips, tongue and tail,he should tak them, and weel 1 wat,mither, quoth he, they’ll get a lumpingpenny-worth o’ me get me wha will*His mither tells him o’ the blackbutcher on Ti’ot-side, wha had threedoughters, and every ane o’ them hadsomething, there was Kate, Ann andGirzy, had a hundred merks the piece.Kate and Ann had baith bastards.Gitzy the eldest had a humph back ahigh breast, baker legged, a short wryneck, tbrawn mouth, and goggle ey’da perfect yEsep of the female kind, withas many crooked conditions within aswithout, a very lump of loun-like ill-nature, row'd a’ together, as if she had4been nine monihs in a baggies, a se¬cond edition of crook backed Rich¬ard, an old English King, that wasborn with teeth to bite a* around a-bout him, and yet the wight gaed madto be married.John’s mither told him the roadwhere to go, and what to say, and ac¬cordingly he sets out wi’ his Sunday’scoat on, and a’ his braws, and a pairof new pillonian breeks o’ his mither’smaking.

A wow na, John, thedaft loons will laugh at you, and she'llthink shame, gang ye out by, andshe'll speak to you throngh the gavelwindovr.Out goes John, and the bride, andher twa sisters goes to the windowwithin to hear the diversion, and whathe would say. Now says John, Girzymy dear, my braw pretty woman, an yebe in earnest, tell me, for by my suthI‘m no scorning-.Girzy.) Indeed, John, I*m very will¬ing to tak ye, but ye needna tell everybody about it.John,) Then gie me a kiss on that.He shuts his head in at the window,making a lang neck to win down toher, and she stood on a little stool towin up to him. O, cries he, an yewere good flesh I could eat you a‘ Hikeyou sae weel; its a pity there is sic ahard wa‘ between us, 1‘setellmy mithersae bonny as ye are: l), gie me anitherkiss yet, and then 1‘llgo. One of hersisters standing by in a dark corner,gets hand o‘ a cow‘s head, which want¬ed a‘ the skin but about the mouth,and shuts it towards his mouth, whichhe kissed in the dark. O, cries he yourmouth be cauld since I kissed ye last,and I think ye hae a beard, I saw naethat before, or is’t wi‘ spinning tow thatmaks your mouth sae rough at een.Hame he comes, and tells his mitherthe speed and properties of the marriage.<9All things was got ready, and next weekSleeky Willie the weaver and him cameto gree the marriage, and stay all nightwith the bride, and teach John goodmanners, for when John was hungry,he minded his meat mair than his goodbehaviour, and he never was fu‘ tillthe dish was tume. Willie the weaverwas to tramp on his fit when hethought he had suppet aneugh; so allthings being agreed upon short, andeasy terms, and the wedding day set,they were to be three times cryed onSunday, and quietly married on Mon¬day, neither piper nor fiddler to beemploy'd, but sweith awa hame frae theMinister, and into the bed amang theblankets; ha, ha, cried John, that's thebest o't a‘.Now every thing being concludedand proposed, the supper was brought,a large fat haggles, the very smell wada done a hungry body gude, but Johnhad only got twa or three soups, untilone of the butcher's meikle dogs tramp¬ed on John's fit, which he took to bethe weaver, and then he would ert naemair. After supper they went to bed10John and the weaver lay together, andthen he abused the weaver fortramping sae soon, which he denied ;but O, said John, there's a hantle o‘tleft, and Isaw whare it was set; they area‘ sleeping, I'll go rise and takasoup o'tyet. Aye, een do sae, said sleeky Wil¬lie, and bring a soup to me too. Awaythen John goes to the amry, and laysto the haggles, till his ain haggles couldbaud nae mair; then brought some toSleeky Willie; but, instead of going tothe bed where he was, goes to the bedwhere the bride and the twa sisters laythey being fast asleep, speaks slowly,Will ye tak it, will ye tak it; but theymaking no answer, he turns up theblankets to put a soup into Willie‘smouth, but instead of doing so, he putsa great spoonful close into one of theirbacksides. Sleeky Willie hears a‘ thatpast, comes out the bed, and sups outthe remainder, and sets up the dishwhere it was, leaves the amry door opento let the cats get the blame of sup¬ping the haggles, and away they go tobed; but poor John couhl get nae sleepfor drouth; up he gets in search of the11water-cann, and finding an empty pit¬cher, puts in his hand to find it' therewas any water in it, but finding nane,he closed his hand when it was withinthe pitcher, and then could not get itout, goes to the bed and tells SleekyWillie what had happened him, whoadvised him to open the door, and goout to a knocKing-stane that stood be¬fore the door, and break it their, toget out his hand, and not to make anoise in the house. So out he goes,and the bride’s sister who had gottenthe great spoonful of the haggies laidto her backside, was out before him,rubbing the nastiness (as she took it tobe) off the tail of her sark, and shebeing in a louting posture, he took herfor the knocking-stane, andcomesowerher hurdies with the pitcher, tillitfiewin pieces about her, then off she runswith the fright, round! a turf-stack, andinto the house before him. John camein trembling to the bed again, wi’ thefright, praying to preserve him, for sic aknocking-etane he never yet saw, for itran clean awa when he broke the pigupon it.12Now John was furnished in a houseby his father-in-law; the bed, the loom,heddles, treadles, thrumbs, reed, andpirn-wheel, was a’ brought and set upbefore the marriage, which was kepta profound secret; so that John gotthe first night of his ain wife, and hisain house at ae time. So on the nextmorning after the marriage, John andhis wife made up some articles, howthey were to work, and keep house;John was to keep the house in meat,meal, fire, and water; Girzy was to makthe meat, and keep the house in clothes;the father-in-law to pay the rent forthree years; they were to hae nae ser¬vants, until they had children ; andtheir first child was to be a John, afterits ain Daddy, get it wha will, if aboy; and if a girl, Girzy, after its ainminny, as ye said wha wrought bestfor’t.ii nMISFORTUNE I.Then she ordered John to rise andbegin his wark, by putting on a fire,and to tak the twa new pigs and gangto the well tor water. No sooner hadJohn opened the door, and gone outwith a pig in every hand, than a’ theboys and girls being gathered inacrowdto see him, gave a loud huzza: and clap¬ping their hands at him, poor John,not knowing what it meant, thought itwas fine sport, began to clap his handstoo, and not minding the twa pigs,clashes the tane against the tither, tillbaith went to pieces, and that was acheerful huzza to baith young and auldthat was looking at him; Girzy thewife draws him into the house, and tohim she flies with the wicked wife’sweapon, her Tongue and Tangs, andmade his ribs to crack, saying, “Theytold me ye war daft, but I’ll ding thedaffing out o’ ye, I’ll begin wi’ you asI’ve a mind to end wi’ you.” PoorJohn sat crying anti clawing his lugs14“Ha, ha,” said he, “its nae bairn’splay to be married, I find that already.”His mother-in-law came in and madeup peace, went to a cooper, and gotthem a big wooden stoup to carry intheir water.MISFORTUNE II.Next morning, John was sent to theFlesh-market an errand to his Father-in-law, who gave him a piece of fleshto carry home, and as he was corningout of the market, he saw six or sevenof the flesher dogs fall on and worry ata poor country colly dog; “Justice, jus¬tice,” cries John to the dogs “ye’rebut a wheen unmannerly rascals, thatfa’s a’ on ae poor beast, heth ye shoulda’ be put in the toubuoth, and ta’en tothe bailies, and hanged for the like o’that; its perfect murder,” and in heruns amongst the dogs, ‘Mnd be hang¬ed to you a’ thegither, What’s the quar¬rel? What’s the quarrel? John flingsdown the flesh he had carrying, andgrips the colly, who took John for anMenemy too, and bites his hand till theblood followed, the whole of the tykescomes a‘ on poor John, till down hegoes in the dirt amongst their feet, andone of the dogs runs off with the flesh,to John went hame both dirty andbloody and without his flesh, told Girzyhow it happened, who apnlied her oldplaister, her Tangs and Tongue, madeJohn to curse the very minister thatmarried them, and wished he mightne‘er do a better turn.T ft f O * • / fTjACir' *' ? • » f -j tj Ll. x * f • r* 11 t VIMISFORTUNE III.<'i A ^ 1 i 1 J # J. t /. i!! OJ f . t UJ n OilNext morning, John was sent to thewell with the great stoup to bring inwater for breakfast; and as he was pul¬ling the stoup out of the well, in betum-bles and his head down, the well beingnarrow, he couldna win out: some peo¬ple passing by chance heard the slunge,cried, and ran to his relief, hauled himout half dead, and helped him into thehouse; and after getting a dry sark, hewas comforted with the old plaister,her Tongue and hard Tangs.MISFORTUNE IV.Next day, she says, John, I mustgo to the market myself, for if you goyou’ll fight wi’ the dogs, and let themrun awa wi’ ony thing you buy: seethat ye put on the pat, hae't boilingagain I come hame. John promisedweel, but performs very badly. She’sno sooner gone, than he puts on thenew pat without any water in it, anda good fire to make it boil, and awayhe goes to the unhappy well fills hisstoup, and sets it down to look at aparcel of boys playing at cat and dog,they persuaded John to take a gamewi’them, on he plays, till ane o* the boyscries, Hey John, yonders your Girzycoming. John runs into the housewi’ the water, and the pat being redhot on the fire, he tumes in the cautdwater into it, which made the pat fleeall in pieces, just as she was enteringthe door. John runs for it, and sheruns after him, crying catch the thief,some persons stopped him j she comesnup, and then she laboured him all theway hame. and he crying, “O Sirs, yesee what it is to be married!” The mi-ther-in-law had to make up peace a-gain, and he promised good behaviourin time to come.MISFORTUNE V.On the next morning she sent him tothe water to wash somecow’spudding’sand turn them on a spindle, shewinghim how he waste do or he went away.John goes to the water very willingly,and as he turned and washed them, helaid them down behind him, where oneof his father-in-law’s big dogs stood,and ate them up as fast as he laid themdown, till all was gone but the verylast ane, which he carried hame in hishand, crying like a child, and under¬went a severe tost of the old plaisterbefore any mercy was shewn.MISFORTUNE VI,His father-in-law, next day, sent him18away to bring home a fat calf he hadbought in the country, and tied up themoney in a napkin, which he carried inhis hand for fear he should lose it. Be¬ing very weighty, as it was all in half¬pence, and as he was going alongst abridge, he meets a man running after ahorse, who cries to John to stop thehorse; John meets him on the top ofthe bridge, and when he would not bestopped for him, he knocks the horseon the face with the napkin and themoney, so the napkin rave, and most ofthe half-pence flew over the bridge inthe water, which made poor John gohome crying very bitterly for his loss,and dread of the old plaister, which hegot very sickerly.MISFORTUNE VII.On the next morning, she sent himagain to the bridge, to see if he couldAnd any ofit in the water, and there hefound some ducks swimming, and duck¬ing down with their heads below thewater, as he thought, gathering up hismoney, he kills one of them, and rips19her up, but found none of it in her gutsor gabbie; then says he, they have beenbut looking for it, I‘ll go do as they didstrips cffhis clothes and leaves them onthe bridge, goes in a ducking, in whichtime, a ragman came past, and took a-way all his clothes. So he went homenaked to get a bath of the old planter.MISFORTUNE VI11.The next morning, she sent him to afarm-house for a pigful of buttermilk,ami as he was returning’ through thefields, the farmer's bull andanotherbullwas fighting; the farmer's bull beinglike to loss, Johnrunsinbehindhim,andsets his head to the bull's tail, on pur¬pose to help him to push against theother; but the poor bull thought Johnfull drive upon John, pushed him downbroke the pig, and spilt the milk. SoJohn went home to get his auld plais-ter, which began to be an usual diet tohim, and so he regarded it the less.soMISFORTUNE IX.His mother-in-law, with several aulclwitty wives, held a private council onJohn’s conduct, and bad luck, and con¬cluded he was bewitched. John wasof the same opinion, and went to theMinister, and told him he wasthecauseof a’ his misfortunes, ca’d him a war-lock to his face, and said, he had putsuch a blacK harg-ain in his hand, thathe was ruined for ever: insisted eitherto unmarry them again, or send deathand the bellman to take her awa, forshe has a lump of mischief on her backand amther on her breast and the lestof her body is a clean deil. The Min¬ister began to exhort him to peace andpatience, telling him that marriageswere made in heaven: “Ye‘re a baistliar, says John, for I was married inyour ain kitchen, anda’ theblackguardsin the town was there, and it had abeen a heaven they wadna win in, yettell me that matrimony was sic a happystate, but had ye gotten as mony weel21pay’d skins as I hae gotten, ye wad akend what it was; ill chance on you sir;and out he goes cursing like a madman,throwing stanes and breakino-the Min¬ister’s windows for which he wascaughtand put twa hours in the stocks, and atlast his lump of corruption came andrubbed his lugs, drew his nose, got himout, and drove him home before her,took a resolution nevei to set him aboutany business in time coming, but keephim on his loom.MISFORTUNE X.Now she gave him no sleep a’ thatnight for scolding, John got up inthe morning lang or dny, and left his2’ormenter in bed, fell asleep upon hisloom with the candle in his hand, andso set the web, heddles, reed, and trea¬dle cords in a tire. By chance las oldViper looked out of the bed, or thewhole house had been gone. Up shegets, and with her cries alarmed theneighbourhood who came to her relief;but poor John underwent a dreadfulswabbing for this..fTfjfrih.’UT! c »iiii a ]•!,. imuMISFORTUNE XLAfter the former hurry and beatingbein"' over, his work being stopt, hewent to bed and slept a‘ that day, andfollowing night. On the next day,having nothing to do, she sent him insearch of a lien’s nest, which had ta‘ensome by-place to lay her eggs in: so aspoor John was in an auid kill searching !a‘ about the walls, the kill-ribs brokeand down he goes with a vengeanceinto the logic, cutted and bruised him¬self in a terrible manner; up he couldnot win, but had to creep out at thelogic below, scarce able to get hame,his face and nose all running of blood.In this’ condition she pitied and la¬mented for him very much, tied hissores and laid him in bed; then satdown very kindly, saying, “My dear,and my lamb, do you think there is onyof your banes broken; and what partof you is sairesl? And what will 1 get23to do good? “Ohl” said he, “Girzy,I’m a’ brizzled atween the feet.” “Areye indeed?” quoth she, “then I wishye had broken your neck, that I mighta gotten anither, useless ae way, anduseless mae ways, upo* my word, “ye’sno be here, gang whare ye like.”MISFORTUNE XII.Now, as poor John was turned outo’ doors next morning, to go awa’ hirp-ling on a staff; one came and told himhis mother had died last nigdit. Ohhoch! said John, and is my mi cher cleandead! O an she wad but look downthrough the lift, and see how I’m guid¬ed this morning, I’m sure she wad senddeath for me too. I’m out o’ a mitherand out o’ a wife, out o’ my health andstrength, and a’ my warklooms. HisMother-in-law came and pleaded forhim: Hand your tongue, mither, saidGirzy, if ye kent what ail’d him ye wad-na speak about him, he’s useless, noworth the keeping in a house, but toca’him to die like an auld beast at a dyke-21side. Hout tout, co’ the auld wife, we’llmak o’ him and he’ll mend again. SoJohn got peace made up after a’, andhe was easier mended than the burntweb; got all his treadles and waikloomsset in order, the wife’s tongueexcepted,which was made of wormwood, and therest of her body of sea water, which isalways in a continual tempest.So John appeals to a Jedburgh Juryif it be not easier to deal wi’ fools thanheadstrong fashions fouks; owns he hasbut an empty skull, but his wicked wifewants wit to pour judgement into it,never tells him o’ danger till it comesupon him, for his mother said he was abiddable bairn, if ony body had been tolearn him wit.FINIS.

One of her sisters standing by in a darkser, gets Itahd o‘ a cow’s head, which wantedhe skin but about the mouth, and shuves ittowards his mouth which he kisses in thek.

I• na that afore; or is it wi‘ spinning tow, thatks your mouth sae rough ateen.lame lie comes and te:ls his mither the speedI properties of th'e marriage. A’ things wereready and next week Sleekie Willie the wea'and him came to grec the marriage, and stayight with the bride, and teach Tam gude man-s; for when Tam was hungry he minded hisat more than his gude behaviour, and he was*er fu’ till the dish was tume. Willie the wea-was to tramp on his fit when he thought he1 supped enough. So all things being agreedjn short and easy terms, and the wedding-day, they were to be three times cried on Sunday1 married on Munanday, neither piper noriler to be employed, but swith awa hame wiminister, and in to the bed amang the blan-s. Ha, ha, cries Tam, that's the best o‘t a‘.tfow every thing beihg concluded and propo-i, the supper was brought, being a large fait'gies, the very smell wad hae done a hungryson gude ; but Tam had only got twa or threeips until ane af the butcher's meikie dogsmped on Tam's fit, which ha took to be theaver and then would sip nae mair. After sup-r they went to bed ; Tam and the weaver lay'ether, and then he abused the weaver sair fbrraping sae soon, which he denied, but told himjre was plenty left. Away then goes Tam toJ amry, and lays to the baggies till his ain could■■■* nae mair; then brings the rest to SleekyWttiie , but instead of going to bed where he vgoes to the bod where the bride and her twa *ters lay sleeping, saying will ye tak it, will ye ait, but they making no answer, he turns up tlblankets to put a soup into Willies mouth, 1instead of doing so, he put a spoonful upon cof their backsides ! poor Tam could get nae shfor drouth, up he gots in search of the water cand finding an empty pitcher, put in his handfind if there was any wator in it, but finding nhe went out out to break it upon a stane thatimight not make a noise ia the house. So oul^igoes, and the bride's sister who had gotten tigreat spoonful laid to her backside, was outjifore him rubbing the rtfstiueas (aa uhe look tbe) off the tail of her sark; and she being ijlooting position he t eok her for the knockstane, and comes a'er her hurdies with the teher till it flew in pieces about l*r. Tam ain trembling to the bed again wi4 the fright, pf|iag to preserve him, for sic t knocking stamnever yet saw, for it ran clean awa when he isthe pig upon it.Now Tam was furnished in a house by his: ither in law, the bed, l6om, heddles, treatsthrums, reeds, and pirn-wheel, was bought iset up before the marriage, which was kept ii|profound secret; ao that Tam got the first llof his ain wife, and Ins ain house at ae time. ;ioh the morning after the marriage, Tam ant! ‘iwife made up some articles how they wea twork and keep the bouse; Tam was to keef hheuse in meat, and Girzy was to mak it, and kfheliouse in claes—their first child was to be uiif ahoy, and Girzy if a girl, after her mitherruhad wrought very sair for it.THE END.*f fl

When quite• clean, if to he boiled, some salt and a little vinegarshould he put into the water to give firmness; huti cod, whiting, and haddock, are far better if a littlesalted, and kept a day ; and if not very hot weatherthey will be good two days.Those who know how to purchase fish, may, hyI taking more at a time than they want for one day,I often get it cheap: and such kinds as will pot orpickle, or keep by being sprinkled with salt andhung up, or by being fried, will serve for stewingthe next day, may then be bought with advantage.Fresh-water fish has often a muddy smell andtaste, to take off which, soak it in strong salt andwater after it is nicely cleaned ; or if of a size tobear it, scald it in the same ; then dry and dress it.TO BOIL SALMON.Clean it carefully, boil it gently, and take it outof the water as soon as done. Let the water bewarm if the fish be split. If underdone it is veryunwholesome.—Shrimp or anchovy-sauce.4TO BROIL SALMON.Cot slices an inch thick, and season with pepperand salt; lay each slice in half a sheet of whitepaper, well buttered, twist the ends of the paper,and broil the slices over a slow fire sii or eightminutes. Serve in the paper with anchovy-sauce.TO DRESS SALT COD.Soak and dean the piece you mean to dress, thenlay it all night in water, with a glass of vinegar.Boil it enough, then break it into flakes on the dish;pour over it parsnips boiled, beaten in a mortar, andthen boil up with cream and a large piece of butterrubbed with a bit of flour. It may be served withegg-sauce instead of the parsnip, and the root sentup whole; or the fish may be boiled and sent upwithout flaking, with the sauces before mentioned.TO PICKLE TONGUES FOR BOILING.Cut off the root, but leave a little of the kerneland fat. Sprinkle some salt, and let it drain fromthe slime till next day: then for each tongue mixa large spoonful of common salt, the same of coarsesugar, and about half as much of saltpetre; rub itwell in, and do so every day. In a week add anotherheaped spoonful of salt. If rubbed every day, atongue will be ready in a fortnight; but if onlyturned in the pickle daily, it will keep four or fiveweeks without being too salt.When you dry tongues write the date on a parch¬ment and tie it on. Smoke them, or dry them plain,if you like best.When it is to be dressed, boil it till extremelytender ; allow five hours ; and if done sooner, it is5asily kept hot. The longer kept after drying, the,igher it will he; if hard, it may require soakingjhree or four hours.TO DRESS A HAUNCH OF MUTTON.Keep it as long as it can be preserved sweet bythe different modes: let it be washed with warmlilk and water, or vinegar, if necessary ; but whend be dressed, observe to wash it well, lest the out¬ride should have a bad flavour from keeping. Put1 paste of coarse flour or strong paper, and fold theaunch in : set it a great distance from the fire, andiilow proportionable time for the paste; don’t takeoff till about thirty-five or forty minutes before;rving, and then baste it continually. Bring theaunch nearer to the fire before yon take off the paste,md froth it up as you would venison.A gravy must be made of a pound and a half ofan of old mutton, simmered in a pint of water tolalf, and no seasoning but salt: brown it with attle burnt sugar, and send it up in the dish; butnere should be a good deal of gravy in the meat;•r though long at the fire, the distance and cover-:«g will prevent its roasting out.—Serve with cur-cant-jelly-sauce.TO ROAST A SADDLE OF MUTTON.. Let it be well kept first. Raise the skin, andMen skewer it on again ; take it off a quarter of anaur before serving, sprinkle it with some salt, baste, and dredge it well with flour. The rump shouldo split, and skewered back on each side. TheTint may be large or small according to the com-any: it is the most elegant if the latter. Being;Toad it requires a high and strong fire.6TO BOIL SHOULDEB OF MUTTON WITH OYSTERS.Hang it some days, then salt it well for two!days: hone it; and sprinkle it with pepper and ahit of mace pounded : lay some oysters orer it, and |roll the meat up tight and tie it. Stew it in a smallquantity of water, with an onion and a few pepper¬corns till quite tender.Have ready a little good gravy, and some oystersstewed in it: thicken this with flour and hutter,and pour over the mutton when the tape is takenoff. The stew-pan should he kept close covered,MUTTON SAUSAGES.Take a pound of the rawest part of the leg ofmutton that has been either roasted or hoiled ; chopit extremely small, and season it with pepper, salt,mace, and nutmeg; add to it six ounces of heef-suet, some sweet herbs, two anchovies, and a pintof oysters, all choped very small: a quarter of apound of grated bread, some of the anchovy liquor,and the yolks and whites of two eggs well beaten.Put it all, when well mixed, into a little pot: anduse it by rolling it into halls or sausage-shape andfrying. If approved, a little shalot may he added,or garlick, which is a great improvement.TO DRESS MUTTON RUMPS AND KIDNEYS.Stew six rumps in some good mutton-gravy halfan hour; then take them up, and let them stand tocool. Clear the gravy from the fat; and put into itfour ounces of hoiled rice, an onion stuck withcloves, and a blade of mace ; boil them till the riceis thick. Wash the ramps with yolks of eggs wellbeaten, and strew over them crumbs of bread, alittle pepper and salt, chopped parsley, and thyme,and grated lemon-peel. Fry in butter of a finebrown. While the rumps are stewing, lard thekidneys, and put them to roast in a Dutch oven.When the rumps are fried, the grease must bedrained before they are put on the dish, and thepan being cleared likewise from the fat, warm therice in it. Lay the latter on the dish ; the rumpsput round on the rice, the narrow ends towards themiddle, and the kidneys, between. Garnish withhard eggs cut in half, the white being left on; orwith different coloured pickles.SCOTCH MUTTON BROTH.Soak a neck of mutton in water for an hour ; cutoff the scrag, and put it into a stew-pot with twoquarts of water. As soon as it boils, skim it well,and then simmer it an hour and a half, then takethe best end of the mutton, cut it into pieces, (twobones in each,) take some of the fat off, and putas many as you think proper; skim the momentthe fresh meat boils up, and every quarter of anhour afterwards. Have ready four or five carrots,the same number of turnips, and three onions, allcut, but not small: and put them in soon enoughto get quite tender: add four large spoonful ofScotch Barley, first wetted with cold water. Themeat should stew three hours. Salt to taste, andserve all together. Twenty minutes before serving,put in some chopped parsley. It is an excellentwinter dish.>!AL BROTH.*)t*w a email knuckle in about three quarts ofater, two ounces of rice, a little salt, and a bladeof mace till the liquor is half wasted away.OLD PEAS SOUP.Save the water of boiled pork or beef; and if tosalt, put as much fresh water to it; or use freshwater entirely, with roast beef-bones, a ham orgammon-bone, or an anchovy or two. Simmer thesewith some good whole or split peas ; the smaller thequantity of water at first, the better. Simmer tillthe peas will pulp through a colander; then set thepulp, and more of the liquor that boiled the peas,with two carrots, a turnip, a leek, and a stick ofcelery cut into bits, to stew till all is quite tender.The last requires less time; an hour will do for it.When ready, put fried bread cut into dice, driedmint rubbed fine, pepper, and (if wanted) salt intothe turreen ; and pour the soup in.GREEN PEAS SOUP.In shelling the peas, divide the old from theyoung; put the old ones, with an ounce of butter,a pint of water, the outside leaves of a lettuce ortwo, two onions, pepper and salt, to stew till you canpulp the peas; and when you have done so, put tothe liquor that stewed them some more water, thehearts and tender stalks of the lettuces, the youngpeas, a handful of spinach cut small, and salt andpepper to relish properly, and stew till quite soft. Ifthe soup is too thin, or nor rich enough, either ofthese faults may Lie removed by adding an ounce ortwo of butter, mixed with a spoonful of rice orwheatflour, and boiled with it half an hour. Beforeserving, boil some green mint shred fine in the soup.MUTTON PIE.Cut steaks from a loin or neck of mutton thathas hung; beat them, and remove some of the fat.Season with salt, pepper, and a little onion; put alittle water at the bottom of the dish, and a littlepaste on the edge; then cover with a moderatelythick paste. Or raise small pies, and breaking eachbone in two to shorten it, season, and cover it over,pinching the edge. When they come out, pour intoeach a spoonful of gravy made of a bit of mutton.CHICKEN PIK.Cut up two young fowls; season with whitepepper, salt, a little mace, and nutmeg, all inthe finest powder; likewise a little Cayenne.Put the chicken, slices of ham, or fresh gammonof bacon, forcemeat-balls, and hard eggs, by turns,in lawyers. If it is to be baked in a dish, put alittle water; but none if in a raised crust. By thetime it returns from the oven, have ready a gravyi f knuckle of veal, or a bit of the scrag, with someshank-bones of mutton, seasoned with herbs, onion,nace, and white pepper. If it is to be eaten hottyou may add truffles, morels, mushrooms, &c. butnot if to be eaten cold. If it is made in a dish, putas much gravy as will fill it; but in raised crust,the gravy must be nicely strained, and then put ingold as jelly. To make the jelly clear, you may10giv« it a boil with the whites of two alt«i-taking away the meat, and then run it through afine lawn sieve.PIGEON PIE.Rub the pigeons with pepper and salt, inside andout; in the latter, put a bit of butter, and if ap¬proved, some Sparsely chopped with the livers, and alittle of the same seasoning. Lay a beef-steak atthe bottom of the dish and the birds on it; betweenevery two, a hard egg. Put a cup of water in thedish ; and if you have any ham in the house, lay abit on each pigeon: it is a great improvement tothe flavour.Observe, when ham is cut for gravy or pies, totake the under part rather than the prime.Season the gizzards, and two joints of the wings,and put them in the centre of the pie; and overthem, in a hole made in the crust, three feet nicelycleaned, to show what the pie is.KAISED CRUST, FOR MEAT PIES, OR FOWLS, &C.Boil water with a little fine lard, and an equalquantity of fresh dripping, or of butter, but notmuch of either. While hot, mix this with as muchflour as you will want, making the paste as stiff asvou can to be smooth, which you will make by wellkneading it, and beating it with the rolling-pin.When quite smooth, put in a lump into a cloth, orunder a pan, to soak till near cold.Those who have not a good hand at raising crustmay do thus ; roll the paste of a proper thickness,and cut out the top and bottom of the pie,then a long piece for the sides. Cement the-r'bottom to the sides wish egg, bringing the forme*rath er farther out, and pinching both together;i|mt egg between the edges of the paste, to make itSere at the sides. Fill your pie, and put on theer, and pinch it and the side crust together,e same mode of uniting the paste is to be observedi if the sides are pressed into a tin form, in which thenaste must be baked, after it shall be filled andovered; but in the latter case, the tin should bejuttered, and carefully taken off when done enough ;and as the form usually makes the sides of a lighterrolour than is proper, the paste should be put intothe oven again for a quarter of an hour. With aleather, put egg over at first.BAKED APPLE PUDDING.Pare and quarter four large apples ; boil themtender, with the rind of a lemon, in so little wateri.hat, when done, none may remain; beat themiquite fine in a mortar; add the crumb of a smallroll, four ounces of butter melted, the yolks of fivei and whites of three eggs, juice of half a lemon, andjuugar to taste ; beat altogether, and lay it in a dish[With paste to turn out.I BOILED BREAD PUDDING.Crrate white bread; pour boiling milk over it>ind cover close. When soaked an hour or two>eat it fine, and mix with it two or three eggs welli eaten. Put it into a bason that will just hold it;e a floured cloth over it, and put it into boilingvater.—Send it up with melted butter poured over.It may be eaten with salt or sugar.Pruncee, or French plumbs, make a fine pud¬dling instead of raisins, either with suet or breadrtudding.19APPLE PIS.Para and core the fruit, having wiped the on;dda; which, with the cores, hoil with a little wate:till it tastes well; strain, and put a little sugar, ana bit of bruised cinnamon, and simmer again. Inthe mean time place the apples in a dish, a pastbeing put round the edge ; when one lawyer is in,sprinkle half the sugar, and shred lemon-peel, andsqueeze some juice, or a glass of cider. If tinapples have lost their spirit; put in the rest of theSipples, sugar, and the liquor that you have boiled.Cover with paste. You may add some butter whenicut, if eaten hot; or put quince-marmalade, orange-paste or cloves, to flavour.HOT APPLE PIE.Make with the fruit, sugar, and a clove, and puta bit of butter in when cut open.A CHEAP SEED CAKE.Mix a quarter of a peck of flour with half a poundlof sugar, a quarter of an ounce of allspice, and a.little ginger; melt three quarters of a pound ofbutter, with half a pint of milk ; when just warm,put to it a quarter of a pint of yeast, and work op¬to a good dough.

You may use the sameruit a third time, by just covering them with brandyhat is over proof; let it stand seven weeks, andhen you draw it off for use, you may lower it by(putting as much water as the brandy was abovei proof. Press the cherries as long as any liquor isffn them, before you fling them away.When you make the cherry-brandy from thefirst infusion, (which is the best, and contains meet38brandy) mix more brand) with it till yon harobrought it to such a degree of colour, that you canjust discern the blaze of a lighted candle, held onthe other side of the wine-glass. If it does nottaste enough of the fruit, add a little more of thefirst infusion ; and to every ten gallons of cherry-brandy, allow a pound and a half of sugar, and aquarter of an ounce of cinnamon and cloves, pound¬ed together; let it stand some time, and it willmuch improve it.When you draw off the second infusion, it willhe rather inferior to the first, and will hear lessbrandy in mixing for sale, but requires double theweight of spice, and more sugar.The third infusion requires no brandy to he putto it, hut must he lowered as before directed ; sweet¬en it, and use spice the same as for the second in¬fusion. The liquor that is pressed from the cherries,after they have been thrice infused, wall he thickerthan the rest, thin it with some brandy, and put toit a proper quantity of sugar and spice ; when it hasstood a few days to settle, it will he fit for use orsale.

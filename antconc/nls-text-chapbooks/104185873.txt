RORYSOX’S BONNET.Ye’ll a’ ha’e heard tell o’ Rab Roryson’s bonnet,Ye’ll a’ ha’e heard tell a’ Rab Roryson’s bonnet,’Twas no for itsel’, ’twas the head that was in it,Glar’d a’ bodies talk o’ Rab Roryson’s bonnet,This bonnet, that theekit his wonderfu’ head,Was his shelter in Winter, in Summer his shade,And at kirk or at market, or bridals I ween,A braw gaucier bonnet there never was seen.Wi’ a round r -sy tap, like a meikle blackboyd,Itwas slouched just a kenning oncither hand side,Some maintain’d it was black, some maintain’dit was blue,It had something o’ baith as a body may trow.But, in sooth, I assure you, for ought that I saw,Still his bonnet had uaething uncommon ava,Tho’ the hall parish talk’d o’ Rab Roryson’sbonnet,’Twas a’ for the marvellous head that was in it.That head—let it rest—it is now in the mools,Tho’ in life a’ the warld beside it were fools,Yet o’ what kind o’ wisdom his head was possest,Nane e’er kent but himsel’, sae there’s nane thatwill miss’t.BARROCHAN JEAN.’Tis hinna ye heard man o' Barrochan Jean 1And hinna ye heard man o’ Barrochan Jean ?How death and starvation came o’er the hailnation,She wrought sic mischief wi’ her twa pawkye’en.14The lads and the lasses were dying in dizzens,The taen kill’d wi’ love, and the tither wi’spleen,The ploughing, the sawing, the shearing, themawing,A’ wark was forgotten for Barrochan Jean.Frae the South and the North o’er the Tweedand the Forth,Sic coming and ganging there never was seen;The comers were cheery, the gangers were blearie,Despairing or hoping for Barrochan Jean.The carlins at hame were a’girning and granning,The bairns were a’ greeting frae morning tille’en,They gat naething for crowdy, but runts boiledto sowdy,For naething gat growing for Barrochan Jean.The doctors declar’d it was past their describing,The ministers said ’twas a judgment for sin,Bn* chey looked sae blae, and their hearts weresae wae,I was sure they were dying for Barrochan JeanThe burns on road-sides were a’ dry wi’ theirdrinking,Yet a’ wadna sloken the drouth o’ their skin;A’ round the peat-stack, and alangst the dyke-backs,The winds were a sighing, sweet BarrochanJean.The timmer ran done wi’ the making o’ coffins,Kirkyards o’ their sward were a’ howkit fu’clean,15Dead lovers were packit like herring in barrels,Sic thousand’s were dying for Barrochan Jean.But mony braw thanks to the Laird o’ Glen-Brodie,The grass owre their groffs is now bonnie andgreen,It sta’ the proud heart of our wanton young lady,And spoil’d a’ the charms o’ her twa Pawkyeen.THE SUMMEE GLOAMIN’.The midges dance aboon the burn,The dew begins to fa’,The pairtricks, down the rushy howm,Set up their e’ening ca’;Now loud and clear, the blackbird’s sangEings through the briery shaw,While, fleeting gay, the swallows playAround the castle wa’.Beneath the gowden gloaming sky,The mavis mends his lay,The redbreast pours its sweetest strains,To charm the lingering day;While weary yeldrins seem to wailTheir little nestlings torn—The merry wren, frae den to den,Gaes jinking through the thorn.The roses fauld their silken leaves,The foxglove shuts its bell,The honey-suckle and the birkSpread fragrance through the dell16Let others crowd the giddy courtOf mirth and revelry,The simple joys that nature yieldsAre dearer than them a’.WHEN ROSIE WAS FAITHFU’.When Rosie was faithful, how happy was I,Still gladsome as Summer the time glided by,I played my harp cheery, while fondly I sangOf the charms of my Rosie the Winter nightslang;But now I’m as waefu’ as waefu’ can be,Come Summer, come Winter, ’tis a’ ane to me,For the dark gloom of falsehood sae clouds mysad soul,That cheerless for aye is the Harper of Mull.I wander the glens and the wild woods alane,In their deepest recesses I make my sad mane,My harp’s mournful melody joins in the strain,While sadly I sing of the days that are gane.Tho’ Rosie is faithless, she’s no the less fair,And the thought of her beauty but feeds mydespair;With painful remembrance my bosom is full,And weary oi life is the Harper of Mull.As slumbering I lay by the dark mountain stream,My lovely young Rosie appeared in my dream;I thought her still kind and I ne’er was sae blest,As in fancy I clasped the dear nymph to mybreast17Thou false fleeting vision, too soon wert thou o’er,Thou wak’dst me to tortures unequalled before;But death’s silent slumbers my grief soon shalllull,And the green grass wave over the Harper ofMullO ROW THEE IN MY HIGHLAND PLAID.Lowland lassie wilt thou goWhere the hills are clad with snow,Where, beneath the icy steep,The hardy shepherd tends his sheep 1111 nor wae shall thee betide,When row’d within my Highland plaid.Soon the voice of cheery springWill gar a’ our plantings ring;Soon our bonnie heather braesWill put on their Summer claes;On the mountain’s snnny side,We’ll lean on us my Highland plaid.When the Summer spreads the flow’rs,Busks the glens in leafy bow’rs,Then we’ll seek the calor shade,Lean us on the primrose bed;While the burning hours preside,I’ll screen thee wi’ my Highland plaid.Then we’ll leave the sheep and goat,I will launch the bonnie boat,Skim the loch in canty glee,Rest the oars to pleasure thee;When chilly breezes sweep the tide,Til hap thee wi’ my Highland plaid.18Lowland lads may dress mair fine,Woo in words mair saft than mine;Lowland lads ha’e mair of art,A’ my boast’s an honest heart,Wliilk shall ever be my pride,O row thee in my Highland plaid.Bonnie lad, ye’ve been sae leal,My heart would break at our farewell,Lang your love has made me fain,Take me—take me for your ain !’Cross the Firth, away they glide,Young Donald and his Lowland bride.BRAVE LEWIE ROY.Brave Lewie Roy was the flower of ourHighlandmen,Tall as the oak on the lofty Benvoirlich,Fleet as the light bounding tenants of Fillin-glen,Dearer than life to his lovely neen voiuch.Lone was his biding, the cave of his hiding,When forced to retire with our gallant PrinceCharlie,Though manly and fearless, his bold heart wascheerless,Away from the lady he aye loved so dearly.But woe on the blood-thirsty mandates ofCumberland 1Woe on the blood-thirsty gang that fulfilledthem IPoor Caledonia 1 bleeding and plundered land,Where shall thy children now shelter andshield them 119Keen prowl the cravens, like merciless ravens,Their prey, the devoted adherents of Charlie,Brave Lewie Eoy is ta’en, cowardly hacked andslain,Ah 1 his nem vcriuch will mourn for him sairly.WALLACE’S LAMENT.Thou dark winding Carron, once pleasing to see,To me thou can’st never give pleasure again,My brave Caledonians lie low on the lea,And thy streams are deep-ting’d with theblood of the slain.Ah! base-hearted treach’ry has doomed ourundoing,My poor bleeding country, what more can Ido 1Ev’n Valour looks pale o’er the red field of ruin,And Freedom beholds her best warriors laidlow.Farewell, ye dear partners of peril 1—farewell!Though buried ye lie in one wide bloody grave,Your deeds shall enoble the place where ye fell,And your names be enrolled with the sons ofthe brave.But I, a poor outcast, in exile must wander,Perhaps, like a traitor, ignobly must die !On thy wrongs, 0 my country 1 indignant Iponder,Ah 1 woe to the hour when thy Wallace mustfly.20fBONNIE WOOD OF CRAJGIE LEA.The broom, the brier, the birken bush,Bloom bonnie o’er thy flowery lea,And a’ the sweets that ane can wish,Frae nature’s hand are strew’d on thee.Thou bounie wood of Craigie lea,Thou bonnie wood of Craigie lea,Near thee I pass’d life’s early day,And won my Mary’s heart in thee.Far ben thy dark green plantings’ shade,The cushet croodles am’rously;The mavis, down thy bughted glade,Gars eeho ring frae every tree.Awa’ he thoughtless, murd’ring gang,Wha tear the nestlings ere they flee;They’ll sing you yet a canty sang,Then, 0 in pity let them be !When Winter blaws in sleety show’rs,Frae aff the Norland hills sae hie;He lightly skiffs thy bonnie bew’rs,As lakh to harm a flower in thee.Tho’ Fate should drag me South the Line,Or o’er the wide Atlantic sea,The happy hours I’ll ever mind,That I in youth haV spent in thee.MM21LANGSYN’ beside the WOODLAND BURNLangsyne beside the woodland bum,Amang the broom sae yellow,I leaned me 'neath the milk-whito thorn,Ou Nature’s mossy pillow;Around my seat the flow’rs were strew’d,That frae the wildwood I had pu’d,To weave mysel’ a simmer snood,To pleasure my dear fellow.I twin’d the woodbine round the rose,Its richer hues to mellow,Green sprigs of fragrant birk I chooseTo busk the sedge sae yellow.The craw-flow’r blue, and meadow pink,I wove in primrose braided link,But little, little did I think,I should have wove the willow.My bonnie lad was forced afar,Toss’d on the raging billow,Perhaps he’s fa’n in bludy war,Or wrecked on rocky shallow;Yet, aye I hope for his return,As round our wonted hauats 1 mourn,And alien by the woodland burn,I pu’ the weeping willow.MOLLY, MY DEAR.The harvest is o’er, and the lads are so funny,Their hearts lined with love and their pocketswith money;From mornin’ till night, ’tis “ My jewel, my honey0<;h 1 go to the North with me, Molly, mydear.”Young Dermot holds on with his sweetbotheration,An’ swears there is only one flower in the nation,Thou rose of the shannon, thou pink of creation,Och! go to the North with me, Molly, my dear.The Sun courts thy smiles as he sinks in theocean,The Moon to thy charms veils her face indevotion.And I my poor self, och 1 so rich is my notion,Would pay down the world for Sweet Molly,my dear.Though Thady can match all the lads with hisblarney,And sing me love songs of the Lakes of Killamey,In worth from my Dermot he’s twenty milesjourney,My heart bids me tell him I’ll ne’er be his dear.ELLEN MORE.The Sun had kissed green Erin’s waves,The dark blue mountains towered between,Mild evening’s dews refreshed the leaves,The Moon, unclouded, rose serene—When Ellen wandered forth unseen,All alone her sorrows to deplore;False was her lover, false her friend,And false was hope to Ellen MoraYoung Henry was fair Ellen’s love,Young Emma to her heart was dear,Nor weal nor woe.did Ellen prove,But Emma ever seemed to share;Yet envious still, she spread the wile,That sullied Ellen’s virtues o’er;Her faithless Henry spumed the while,His fair, his faithful Ellen More.She wandered down Loch-Mary side,Where oft at evening hour she stoleTo meet her love with secret pride,Now deepest anguish wrung her soulO’ercome with grief she sought steep,Where Yarrow falls with sullen roar;Oh ! Pity, veil thy eyes and weep,A bleeding corpse lies Ellen More.The Sun may shine on Yarrow braes,And woo the mountain flowers to bloom,But never can his golden raysAwake the flower in yonder tomb.There oft young Henry strays forlorn,When Moonlight gilds the abbey tower;There oft from eve till breezy morn,He weeps his faithful Ellen More.COGGIE, THOU HEALS ME.Dorothy sits in the cauld ingle neuk,Her red rosy neb’s like a labster tae;Wi’ girning, her mou’s like the gab o’ the fleuk,Wi’ smokin’, her teeth’s like the jet o’ the slae.24And aye she sings weeis me, aye she sings weekme,Coggie, thou heals me, coggie, thou heals me,Aye my best friend, when there’s ony thing ailsme,Ne’er shall we part till the day that I die.Dorothy ance was a weel tocher’d lass,Had charms like her nei’bours, an’ lovers anew,But she spited them sae, wi’ her pride and hersauce,They left her for thirty lang Summers to rue.Then aye she sang waes me, aye she sang waesme,0 I’ll turn crazy, 0 I’ll turn crazy,Naething in a’ the wide world can ease me,De’il take the wooers— O what shall I do 1Dorothy, dozen’d wi’ living her lane,Pu’d at her rock, wi’ the tear in her e’e,She thought on the braw merry days that weregane,And caft a wee coggie for company,Now aye she sings weeis me, aye she sings weeisme,Coggie, thou heals me, coggie thou heals me,Aye my best friend, when there’s ony thing ailsme,Ne’er shall we part, till the day that I die.

Weel, ye see,it sae happenit, that Habbie, like monie mae nooa days was gayan fondo’ a weedrap o’theblue,andas thestprie gangs, sae was his wife; sa:e it aften hap¬pened, when Habbie ydkit the fuddle, Janet yokitit tae. Noo it’s an auld Scotch saying and a trueane, that when a cannel’s lichted at baith ends, itsune burns dune—an’ it was sae ye . ified in the pre¬sent caise, for Habbie waukening ae morning aftera heavie fuddle, says to Janet, “ Kisevwuman, andsee if ye can get me hauf a gill; for oh i ma heidis jist likin to split.” *• Hauf a gill! ” quo’ Janet,“ whaar wud I get it, when there’s no a plaek ina’ the house ; and as for takin’ it on, ye ken that’sclean out o’ the quastion; sae ye maun jist lie stilland thole the best way ye can.” “Oh ! Janet,cries Habbie, ye’re no amiss at scheming; is therenae way ava ye can think o’ to raise the win ?’’“ I’ll tell ye what I’ll dae, quo’ Janet, I’ll awa tothe Laird o’ Johnston, and I'll tell him that ye’redeid, and as ye’re a great favourite o’ his I’m sureI II get something frae him', to help to burie ye.”“ Od, that ’ill do graun,” quo’ Habbie. So up getsJanet, and awa to the Laird’s house; when rappingtho knocker, the door was opened by the leddie,n3>\ha seeing Janet sae pitifu' Inkin’, she says, “Keepus a’ the day, are thaire onie thing wrang at hame,that ye hae come here sae stme in the morning“ Wrang!” quo’ Janet, (dichtin’ her een wi’ thetail o’ her apron,) “a’s wrang the gither, my leddie;is na oor liabbie deid ?” “ Habbie deid !” quo’the lady in surprise. “ A weel a wat, is he,” quo’Janet, “ an a sair trial it is to me, leddie, for thaireno as muckle in the house this morning as vypwdfeid a sparrow; an’ whaur to get onything, I’m sureI dinna ken. Oh deir! oh deir! that ever itshould come to this o’t,” Compose yoursel’Janet,” quo’ the leddie, “ and come yer was ben an’we’s see what can be dune ” Sae in gangs Janetwi’the leddie,an’gets a basket wi’some biscuits andspeerits, an’ utber articks needfu’ for sic an occas¬ion ; an’thanking the leddic tor her kindness, comesawahaine to Habbie fu’blithelie, whan doune theysat; nor did they rise till they made an end to thecontents o’ the basket. Noo. as the auld sangsings, the mair ye drink, the drier ye turn, forthey were nae sunner dune, than Habbie says,“ Losh Janet, that was real guid ; can ye no getsome mair o’t. “ Na, na,” qua’ Janet, “ I hae playedma part; it’s your turn noo.’’ ‘ Oh ! very w'oe1,’ quo’Habbie, “ if it’s my turn noo, ye maun jist be deidnext.” “ Od, I hae nae objections,’ quo’ she ; sae’awaye gang and let ua see what ye can dae.” Weel,awa gangs Habbie, anl meeting the Laird jist cqm-ing hame frae a hunting partie, be says, “ this is afine day, Laird.” “ A fine day, liabbie,” quo’the Laird : “ boo is a’ wi’ ye ? are ye no coming4np to play us a spring on the pypes the nicht? ’“ It wadna leuk verra weel, Laird, for to be teenplaying on the pypes at your house, and mv ainwife lying deid“ at hame.” “What! is Janetdeid ?” quo’ the Laird. “ Atweel is she’ quo’Habbie ; and I’m sure it eouldna hae happent ona waur time, tor they’re neither meat nor siller inthe house ; and hoo to get her decently aneath theyird I’m sure I dinna ken.” “Dinna vex yoursel’about that,” quo’ the Laird, (giving him somemoney,) “there is a trifle for you, in the mean time,and come up to the house by and by and I shallsee what can be done for you” Hahbie thanked theLaird for his kindness, bade him guid day, andcam’ awa hame gayen weel pleast wi’ what he hadgotten, and sent Janet awa wi’the bottle for mairwhusky, to carry on the spree. In the mean time,hame gangs the Laird, whan the first thing heheard, was, that Habbie Simpson was deid. “ Na‘na,” quo’ he, “its no Habbie ; its only Janet. ’‘ Its Habbie'’ quo’ the Leddie “wasna Janet heirthis morning hersel’, and telt me ?—and didna sheget awa some speerits and bakes, as she saidthere w’as naething in the house ?” And didna 1meet Habbie, jist as I was cornin’ hame, when hetelt me Janet was deid. Bot I see how it is—theyare at their auld tricks again. Bit come, wee’l*wa to Habbie's, and see what they are about.In the meantime Habbie and Janet are fuddlin'awain fine style, and lauchin’ heartily at the way theyhad raised the winn, when Janet cries “ gude pre¬serve, ns Habbie, what’s to be dune noo: Ideclare5if that's no the Laini and the Leddie ; and thairecornin’ straicht in here.” "1 dinna ken quo’Habbie, “what to do, unless we baitlx be deid.”Saein the bed they gaed ;an’they were naesounnerdoon, than the Laird and Lady cam in and seeingHabbie and Janet in the bed he says, ‘waes, meisna that an awfu’ sicht to see ; the man and thewife baith deed ?—bit I wud gie five shillings thismoment, for to ken which of the twa deet first.”The words were nae sunner oot o’ his mouth, thanup jumps Habbie, cryin’ “it was me, Laird, noo gieme the five shillings.” It is needless to add, thatthe Laird gave Habbie the money, and had manya hearty laugh, when he thought on the way whichHabbie Simpson and his wife had taken to raisethe wind,,««!» fcu’.iwr*.*-: -i• 71 iof aid juxup ,iO ,: hiot- ui felt risJ^• M yh •! »xan vroii eiqyqgad nO' • • cl! n ',i as : .rub- jo oa«£‘j lliw ili p tiO i, dsw % mini suit qn fiinul flrw Biinp■ f.-!i Hq yblrr; to eifled SilJ ui gnhk: u b oruy* ul” -cqs-os bwoa j'-qeni8 deHhisb tod ttok Jnh' bn -iModdoyn aid oi ortbnyd c8.1'ia- t.’tv- ;:oa8 fine oncJlad JA>fi i" «id qu bind nod Luo * old »H[bi '?/] fifow -iew ®ri ’ti.• ••*••<5 tuid 'on r o'. .*•»' //on Jj'fTbr 3r’8id<j.;i I 10 i#Lyfe & Deeth of Habbie Sympson,THE FAMOUS PIPER OF KILBARCHAN.Written bj Robert Semple, of Belltress, in the year1598.Kilbarchan now may say Alace!For scho hes lost hir game and grace,Baith “ Trixie ” and the “ Maiden-trace.”But qflliat remeid ?For nae man can supply his place,Hab Simpson’s duid.Now quha sail play “ The day it dawis,’'Or, “ Hunt up quhen the Cock he craws,’’Or, quha can for Kirk-townies caus,Stan us in steid ?On bagpypis now nae body blawis,Sen Ilabbie’s deid.Or, quha will cause our scheirers scheir,Quha will hang up the braigs of weir,Bring in the bellis or gude play Meir,In tyme of neid ?Hab Simpson coud.

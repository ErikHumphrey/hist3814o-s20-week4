rye.The spring is waning fast, my love,The corn is in the earThe summer nights are coming, love.The moon shines bright and clear.Then pretty Jane, my dearest Jane!Ah! never, never look so shy,But meet me, meet me in the evening,While the bloom is on the rye.But name the day, the wedding day,And I will buy the ring ;The lads and maids in favours white,And village bells—the village bells shall ring.The spring is waning fast, my love,The corn is in the ear,The summer nights are coming, love,The moon shines bright and clear.Then pretty Jane, my dearest Jane!Ah! never, never look so shy,But meet me, meet me in the evening,While the bloom is on the rye.THE LILY OF FRANCE.Let the lily of France in luxuriance wave,Let the shamrock of Erin its beauty maintain,Jjet the rose of fair England still wave its perfume,But the thistle of Scotland will dearest remain.To Scotia her thistle, her broad waving thistle,The evergreen thistle will dearest remain.6’Twas the badge that our fathers triumphantly wore,When they follow’d their sovereigns to vanquish theDane ;The emblem in battle our Wallace aye bore,Then the thistle of Scotland must dearest remain.To Scotia her thistle, &c.It blooms on our mountains, it blooms in the vale,It blooms in the winter, in snow, and in rain ;The type of her sons when rude seasons assail—To Scotia her thistle will dearest remain.To Scotia her thistle, &c.THE LIGHT OF OTHER DAYS.The light of other days is faded.And all their glory’s past,For grief with heavy wing hath shadedThe liopes too bright to last;The world which morning’s mantle clouded,Shines forth with purer rays ;But the heart ne’er feels, in sorrow shrouded.The light of other days.But the heart ne’er feels, in sorrow shrouded,The light of other days.The leaf, which autumn tempests wither,The birds, which then take wing,When winter’s winds are past, come hitherTo welcome back the spring ;The yery ivy on the ruin,Its gloomful life displays ;But the heart alone sees no renewingThe light of other days.But the heart alone sees no renewingThe light of other days.RORY O’MORE.Young Rory O’More courted Kathleen Bawn,He was bold as a hawk, and she, soft as the dawn,He wish’d in his heart pretty Kathleen to please,And he thought the best way to do that was to teaze ;“ Now, Rory be aisy,” sweet Kathleen would cry,Reproof on her lip, but a smile in her eye,With your tricks I don’t know, in troth, what I’mabout,Faith, you’ve teaz’d till I’ve put on my cloak insideout;“ Oh ! jewel,” says Rory, “ that same is the wayYou’ve thrated my heart for this many a day,And ’tis plaz’d that I am, and why not, to be sure ?For ’tis all for good luck,” says bold Rory O’More.“Indeed then,” says Kathleen, “don’t think of thelike,For I half gave a promise to soothering Mike,The ground that I walk on, he loves, I’ll be bound,”“ Faith,” says Rory, “ I’d rather love you than theground,”“ Now, Rory, I’ll cry, if you don’t let me go ;Sure 1 dream every night that I’m hating you so!” i“Oh!” says Rory, “that same I’m delighted to hear.For dhrames always go by conthrairies, my dear ;Oh! jewel, keep dhraming that same till you die.And bright morning will give dirty night the black lie:And ’tis plaz’d that I am, and why not, to be sure?Since ’tis all for good luck,” says hold Rory O’More.Arrah Kathleen, my darlint, you’ve teaz’d me enough,And I’ve thrash’d for your sake Dinny Grimes andJim Duff,And I’ve made myself, drinking your health, quite abaste,So I think, after that, I may talk to the priestThen Rory, the rogue, stole his arm round her neck,So soft and so white, without freckle or speck.And he look’d in her eyes, that were beaming withlight,And he kiss’d her sweet lips—don't you think he wasright ?“Now Rory, leave off, Sir—you’ll hug me no more.That's eight times to-day that you’ve kiss’d me before,”“ Then here goes another,” says ho, “to make sure,For there’s luck in odd numbers,” says Rory O'More.

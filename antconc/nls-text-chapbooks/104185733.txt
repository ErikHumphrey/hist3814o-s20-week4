THELOST AND UNDONEsoar of PFXfcDiTiour,LIFE AND DEAT& OFJudas Iscariot.PRINTED FOR I HE BOOKSELLERS.THELOST AND UNDONESon of Perdition.It is to be observed, that the Scripturemakes mention of three Judases; thefirst in Judas Maccabeus, the second Ju¬das the son of Joseph, the reputed fatherof our Lord ; and third, Judas Iscariot,the son of a tanner, living in repule atJoppa, a sea-port town near Jerusalem.This Judas who betrayed our Lord, washis mother’s first child, who dreamedthat the child in her womb would proveboth a thief and a murderer, and bringher and h^ r generation to shame & dis¬grace : which so terrified her, that shewas like to go distracted ; but her hus¬band strove to pacify her, bidding herleave it to God the wise disposer of allthings who may take it away in its in-4fancy or endue it with more grace thanever to be guilty of such dishonourableactions.—This somewhat quieted her,and she was soon after delivered of alovely male child ; but under his leftbreast was the following curious marks,viz a cross, a gallows, two daggers, andseveral pieces of money : this likewiseterrified his mother, who concealed itfrom her husband, determining, as soonas she was able, to go to a magician andknow the signification of these surpris¬ing marks. The child being circumcis¬ed, and she purified, according to theold Jewish custom, she dressed herselfin disguise, put a veil on her face, andtaking with her a kinswoman, wrent tothe magician’s, and being introducedto him, she i elated her dream, her fearsand the marks upon her son, desiringthe internrelation of the dream, andthe signification of the marks.The magician replied, 1 am no inter¬preter of dreams, neither do I justlyknow the signification of marks, Sc the5whole of your story appears as strangeto me, as it can be amazing to you; butif you can tell me when the child wasborn, I will calculate its nativity, andsee what it portends. He then calledfor pen, ink, & paper, & sitting down,calculated his nativity; & when he hadfinished it, he shook his head, and hiscountenance waxed pale ; which beingperceived by Judas’s mother, she saidunto him, do not deceive me, but tellme true, hide nothing from rne, whetherit be good or evil.—Then, said the ma¬gician, to your sorrow I have seen therules of the planet that reigned predo¬minant at your son’s birth, that he wouldprove a thief and a murdeier, & whatis worse, he will, for lucre, betray theLord of Life ; for which act he will af¬terwards despair of mercy, lay violenthands on himself, and come to a shame¬ful end.—These words pierc’d the mo¬ther’s heart, who, wringing her hands,wished she had never been born, ratherthan to have been the mother of such an6unhappy child; and asked the magicianwhat she could do to prevent the bring¬ing of shame of disgrace on her family?He told her he knew no way of preven¬tion, but by laying violent hands on it,which might be now easily done in itsinfancy,—in a manner so as not to bediscovered.—To this she replied, thatshe would not for ten thousand worldscommit such an act of violence on herson ; as if her husband had the least sus¬picion of it, he was so fond of Judas,that he would never be reconciled to heragain ; yet for the sake of her family,she would by some means or other pre¬vent it without destroying it; and thentold the magician, if she had a smallboat made like a shell, with a cover togo down close that no water might getin, and a little vent to let in air at top,and room in it to lie soft and easy, shemight without danger send him downthe river Jordan, and so commit himwholly to the protection of Providence,which might conduct him to some dis-7tant shore,into thehandsofsometenderpersons, and thereby pieserve his life;'& if he afterwards commits those baseactions the shame will fall on his ownhead, as no one will know from whomhe is descended. The magician highlycommended her for her invention, andsaid he would procure such a boat forher ; and she promising him a good re¬ward for his assistance, returned home.After she was gone, the magician sentfor one Rot, a very cunning artist, ajoiner, to trade, who undertook to makethe boat, drawing out with his pencil,the form of it, carried it home with him,wrought upon it in private, & havingsoon finished it, brought it to the magi¬cian’s house, who paid him largely forit, & sent a servant to the house of Si¬mon. who told Judas's mother, that thematter which his master & she spoke ofwas now finished. She understandinghim, went next morning to the magi¬cian’s house, viewed the boat, & liked itwell, saying it was very convenient for8the end intended, but seem’d perplexedbow she should do it privately, & keepit from discovery as death was the con¬sequence thereof. Her kinswoman beg¬ged her to leave that to her, and allshould be safe enough; for we will feignthe child sick for a day or two, in themeantime we will make some inquiry inthe city for the dead body of some poormale child which we will buy of its pa¬rents, and have it privately brought toour house to be buried ; in the mean¬time we will dispatch your son to sea,and make him believe the other childto be his, and that he died during hisabsence ; so having it buried, the mat¬ter can never be brought to light.The mother liked the contrivance, &going home with a promise of a greatreward, and her friendship for life, sheswore her servants to secrecy, & then,said she, we must act in this manner.When your master comes home at night,I shall put on verv dejected looks, andwhen he asks the cause, I shall tell him9that Judas is not well, and that I am ap¬prehensive of his death, which you mustall testify & confirm. She accordinglyput this scheme into practice at night,when her husband did all he could tocomfort her, telling her that they wereyoung, they might be parents of manychildren; and going up stairs to see thechild, the maid then pinched its necktill it was black in the face, and think¬ing it in convulsions, gave it over todeath. As soon as he was gone out inthe morning, the mother & kinswomantook the child Sc went to the magician’shouse, in order to put the child to sea.They put on him many warm and richgarments, with an upper coat of oil,that no water might penetrate it; andthe magician, on a piece of parchment,wrote the following words :My Name is JUDAS.which his mother sewed round his neckand put him into the boat, and shutar10down the cover. At parting with thechild the mother was almost distracted,wringing her hands and weeping much,but being comforted by the magician Scher kinswoman she was at last pacified,& desired to go home, as she could notbear to see her child put into the water,so she and her kinswoman departedhome. The magician then took the boat& can ied it down to his own garden, atthe foot of which ran the river Jordan,& putting it in where a strong streamran, it was soon carried out of sight.Tire mother when she got home faint¬ed away, but was revived by being in¬form’d by her maid-servant, that duringher absence they had almost brought thematter to a close, having found a neigh¬bour’s male child, who had died the daybefore, and was ;,ust of the same age asJudas, for whose body they had giventhe parents a small sum of money, andpaid the expense of burying a coffin fullof bones, by way of a blind ; and the11only thing’ to be done was to deceiveher husband, and £et this child buriedunder the sanction of Judas’s body.The father came home at night, andfinding his wife in tears, soon guessedthe dismal cause ; and inquiring of theservants, they with dissembled grieftold him, that the child died in themorning soon after his departure. Theman was much affected with the loss ofhis child, and thinking to prevent hiswife’s grief by the sight of the body hehad it removed to a kinsman’s house,and in a day or two interred it fromthence, believing it to be his son.By this time Providence had conductedJudas, alive & well, upon the coast ofof Iscariot, a kingdom in Palastine,where Pheophilus the king often usedto recreate himself, in beholding theships pass and repass at sea. It hap¬pened that the very day that Judas wascast on the coast, the king and his no¬bles came on that diversion, & as theywere standing on the top of the rock.12looking1 into the sea, the king' espied alittle boat floating upon the water, andthinking it to be a chest of some wreck¬ed ship, he ordered a servant to put outa boat and fetch it $ which being done,and brought to the king, he ordered itto be broke open ; when to their greatsurprise, they found a lovely babe, wholook,d up, and smiled in the king'sface. Then said the king to the child,WELCOME as MY OWN CHILD ;and expressed much joy in being provi¬dentially sent to preserve the babe’slife, and taking it up in his arms, said,if thou wert a child begat by me, Icould not esteem or value thee more.Then he espied about its neck the a-forementioned parchment, viz :My Name is JUDAS.Well, said the king, as thy name is Ju¬das, I will now double name thee, andthen called him Judas Iscariot, becausehe found him near the coast of that13name. He was then brought to court,treated as the king’s own child, & at aproper age educated well, and at lastbecame a man of learning and parts,and behaved himself so wisely, that theking made him his principle steward.Judas being arrived at this rank, stillcoveted greater, and remembering theI queen one day said, that if the prince,her son died, Judas should be her heir,he therefore set about contriving to killhim, accordingly professed great loveand friendship for him ; and one daybeing walking- tog-ether, Judas tookoccasion to quarrel with the prince,l and maliciously slew him, thinking allwould go well with him if he was dead.Behold the servant which the kingLong nourish’d in his breast.Grown v arm, strikes forth his banefulsting.Though none accused him of the mur- :der, yet his conscience so stun# him, jthat he soon quitted the kingdom, leav¬ing all his pomp and finery behind him,and changing his name, took upon himthe mean employ of a servant, wander¬ing about from place to place, until atlength he arrived at Joppa, the place ofhis nativity; here he soon got a place ina nobleman’s family, where he behavedso well as to gain the esteem of his lordand lady, and all that knew him. Oneday it happened, that as his lady waswalking abroad big with child, she long¬ed for some fruit, which she saw in Ju¬das’s father’s garden, bidding bim go &buy her some. He took the money, butresolved to steal the fruit; and g'oingto the garden, broke down the fences,which as he was doing his father cameout and seized him for the robbery, &Judas, to keep himself from the handof justice, murdtred his father, andimmediately escaped to Theba, a cityabout seventy-six leagues distance.Here he continued about four years,15in which time the noise of the murderbeing blown over, lie returned backagain, and got a good place in a noble¬man’s family, wheie he lived sometime,till his own mother accidentally seeing1him fell in love with and married him.About five years after they had beenmarried, one morning in bed Judas’sshirt bosom lay open, when she sawunder his left breast the marks he wasborn with ; upon which she waked himin an agony, and told him the storyof his birth, and the part she had actedtherein. Judas heard this with wonderand astonishment, and on his part con¬fessed to her the many crimes he hadbeen guilty of; after which she desiredhim to depart from her, and seek mer¬cy of God in another country ; pro¬testing she would never be carnallyknown to him any more.Judas full of grief & remorse of con¬science, left Joppa and wandered aboutlike a pilgrim, till he heard of a mightyprophet called Jesus of Nazareth,16in the land of Judea, who wroughtmany miracles, and wondeiful works;to him he went, and liking his doctrineand seeing his miracles, he begged ofour Lord to be admitted one of his fol¬lowers: making him one of his disciples,and also his treasurer. Notwithstand-ino- all this Judas could not forget hiscovetousness, for when Mary Magda¬len brought a box of costly ointment,to annoint our dear Lord's feet, at thehouse of Simon the Leper, Judas wasoffended thereat, because the valuethereof was not put into his bag. Butour Lord knowing his covetous andwicked heart, sharply rebuked him ; atwhich he was so enraged, that he inrevenge premeditated, and put intoexecution, the worst action of all hislife, and going to the chief priests andelders, he said unto them, what willyou give me, and I will betray himthey call Jesus into your hands ? Andthey agreed with him for thirty piecesof silver,17The love of money is a rockWhich causes care and trouble,And he that hasteth to be rich.He makes his sorrows double,| Money’s a most alluring bate,Conducive unto evil,For this, base Judas sold his God,Himself unto the devil.When our Lord was instituting his last! snpper, he said unto his disciples, I havei chosen you twelve, but one of you is aI devil. And again, Verily I say unto ye,I one of ye this night shall betray me, &I he it is unto whomsoever I shall give asop : then giving a sop unto Judas, hesaid unto him what thou dost do quick¬ly. With the sop the devil entered intoJudas, and he went out from amongstthem.—Judas then went to the chiefpriests, & received the thirty pieces ofsilver; so taking with him an armedband, telling them that whomsoever heshould kiss, the same was he, hold him18fast, came back to where Jesus wasand meeting him in the Garden oGethsemane, he went up to him sayingHail, Master, and kissed him. The!they laid hands on the Lord, and bonnehim as a thief and a murderer, and leehim away to the high Priest and Ehlei s,who asked him many questions ; tcwhich our Lord gave them no answerbut stood like a lamb dumb before h«shearers. Nevertheless, the whole as-sembly, though they found nothingworthy of death in him, one by one'passed the following sentences on him :19JERUSALEM’SBJLACK TRIEStT^KTAffi;OR, THEBloody Sentence of the Jeivs,AGAINSTOUR BLESSED LOUD AND SAVIOUR,CIIKISTP.CAIPHAS.Better one man should die, than allperish.JEflOSOPHAT.Let him be bounil, and kept fast inchains.RAPIIAR*Let us put him to death.FA HE AS.Let us banish him, or he will destroyour country.DIARRHEAS.He is worthy of death, because heseduceth the people.20RABINTH.Guilty or not, let the seducer die.IjESSA#Let us banish him for ever.CHIERIES.If he be innocent he shall die, becausehe stirreth up the people.PTOIiEMEUS#Guilty or not guilty, let us sentencehim to death or punishment,TERAS.Either banish him or send him un-,to Caesar.EEMECH.Punish him with death.POTIPHARES*Let him be banished for seducinirthe people.The mob also cried put to PontiusPilate, if you let this man go, you are!not Caesar’s friend ; therefore, crucifyhim ! crucify him !21THESENTENCE OF DEATHPASSED ONJESUS CHRIST,BYPontius Utlot.I Pontius Pilate, Judge in Jeiusalemunder the most potent Tiberius, happyand prosperous be his reign, having-heard and known the accusation ofJesus of Nazareth, whom the Jewsbrought bound, do pronounce his sen¬tence ; seeing he, by presumptuous ex¬pressions, called himself the Son ofGod, and the King of the Jews, andsaid he would destroy the Temple ofSolomon. Let him be condemned tothe cross with the two Thieves.Thus was the Lord of Life condemn’d,On Calvry's mount to die,As Moses’ Serpent so was heThere lifted up on high.’Twas not for sins that weie his own,He there shed forth his blood,But that such sinners vile as we,Might be brought neai to God.Let us obey the gospel call,New while it is to-day,Lest ere to-morrow Death should cry,To judgment come away.MISERABLE AND AWFUL ENDOF TH*TRAITOR JUDAS.NOW JUDAS, the Traitor, havingi heard all that was done, repented ofiwhat he had done, and in the greatesti: confusion he repaired to the chief3Priests and Elders, and said unto them,II have sinned, in that I have betrayedUhe innocent blood.

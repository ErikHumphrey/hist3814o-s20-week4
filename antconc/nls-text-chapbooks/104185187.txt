man o' Barrochan Jean ?How death and starvation came o’er the hail nation.She wrought sic mischief wi’ her twa pawky e’en jThe lads and the lasses were dying in dizzens,The taen kill’d wi’ love and the tither wi’ spleen,The ploughing, the sawing, the shearing, the mawing,A’ wark was forgotten for Barrochan Jean!Frae the south and the north, o’er the Tweed and theForth,Sic coming and ganging there never was seen,The comers were cheery, the gangers were blearie,Despairing or hoping for Barrochan Jean.The carlins'at hamo were a’ girning and granning,Tho bairns were a’ greeting frae .morning till e’eu,They gat naething for crowdy, but runts boiled tosowdy,For naethink gat growing for Barrochan Jean.The doctors declar’d it was past their describing,The ministers said ’twas a judgment for sin,But they looked sae blae, and their hearts were sae wae,I was sure they were dying for Barrochan Jean.The burns on road-sides were a’ dry wi’ their drinking,Yet a’ wadna sloken the drouth o’ their

fa’,The pairtricks, down the rushy howm,Set up their e’ening ca’;Now loud and clear the blackbird’s sangRings through the briery shaw,While, fleeting gay, the swallows playAround the castle wa’Beneath the gowden gloaming skyThe mavis mends his lay,The redbreast pours its sweetest strains,To charm the lingering day ;While weary yeldrins seem to wailTheir little nestlings torn,The merry wren, frae den to den,Gaea jinking through the thorn.The roses fauld their silken leaves,The foxglove shuts its bell.The honey-suckle and the birkSpread fragrance through the dell,Let others crowd the giddy courtOf mirth and revelry,The simple joys that nature yieldsAre dearer far to me.KOSIE WAS FAITHFU’,When Rosie was faithful, how happy was I,Still gladsome as summer the time glided by ;I played my harp cheery, while fondly I sangOf the charms of my Rosie the winter nights lang: ;But now I’m as waefu’ as waefu’ can be,Come summer, come winter, ’tis a’ ane to me.For the dark gloom of falsehood sae clouds my sad souliThat cheerless for aye is the Harper of Mull.I wander the glens and the wild woods alane,In their deepest recesses I make my sad mane,My harp’s mournful melody joins in the strainWhile sadly I sing of the days that are gane :Tho’ Rosie is faithless, she’s no the less fair,And tho thought of her beauty but feeds my despair*With painful remembrance my bosom is full,And weary of life is the Harper of Mull.As slumbering I lay by the dark mountain stream,My lovely young Rosie appeared in my dream;I thought her still kind and I ne’er was sae blest,As in fancy I clasped the dear nymph to my breast;Thou false fleeting vision, too soon wert thou o’er,Thou wak’dst me to tortures unequalled before;But deatli’s^ltlent slumbers my grief soon shall lull,And the green grass wave over the Harper of Mull.0 ROW THEE IN MY HIGHLAND PLAID.Lowland lassie wilt thou goWhere the hills are clad with snow,Where, beneath the icy steep,The hardy shepherd tends his sheep ?Ill nor wae

side,We’ll lean on us my Highland pla^\When the summer spreads the flow’rs,Busks the glens in leafy bow’rs,Then we’ll seek the calor shade,Lean us on the primrose bed;While the burning hours preside,I’ll screen thee wi’ my Highland plaidThen we’ll leave the sheep and goat,I will launch the bonny boat,Skim the loch in canty glee,Rest the oars to pleasure thee;When chilly breezes sweep the tide,I’ll hap thee wi’ my Highland plaid,Lowland lads may dress mair fine.Woo in words mair saft than mine;Lowland lads ha’e mair of art,A’ my boast’s an honest heart,Whilk shall ever be my pride ;0 row thee in my Highland plaid!Bonny lad, ye’ve been sae leal.My heart would break at our fareweel.Lang your love has made me fain,Take me—take me for your ain!Cross the Firth, away they glide,Young Donald and his Lowland bride.BRAVE LEWIE ROY.a v e Lewie Roy was the flower of our Highlandmen,fiFall as the oak on the lofty Benvoirlich,Jjtet as the light bounding tenants of Fillin-gleu,aDearer than life to his lovelv neen voiucfLend was liis biding, tbss cave of his hiding,When forced to retire with our gallant Prince Charlie/Though manly and fearless, his bold heart was cheeriestAway from the lady he aye loved so dearly.But woe on the blood-thirsty mandates of Cumberland!Woe on the blood-thirsty gang that fulfill’d them!Poor Caledonia! bleeding and plundered land,Where shall thy children now shelter and shieldthem?Keen prowl the cravens, like merciless ravens,Their prey,—the devoted adherents of Charlie.Brave Lewie Roy is ta’en, cowardly hacked and slain—Ah! his neen voiuch will mourn for him sairly.WALLACE’S LAMENT.Thou dark winding Carron, once pleasing to see,To me thou can’st never give pleasure again,My brave Caledonians lie low on the lea,And thy streams are deep-ting’d with the blood olthe slain.Ah! base-hearted treach’ry has doomed our undoing, JMy poor bleeding country, what more can I do? |Lv’n Valour looks pale o’er the red field of ruin.And Freedom beholds her best warriors laid low.Farewell, ye dear partners of peril!—farewell!Though buried ye lie in one wide bloody grave, ,Your deeds shall ennoble the place where ye fell.And your names be enroll’d with the sons of thebrave.But I, a poor outcast, in exile must wander.Perhaps, like a traitor, ignobly must die!On thy wrongs, 0 my country! indignant I ponder,—Ah! woe to the hour when thy Wallace must fly! 1ITBONNY WOOD OF CRAIGIE LEA,CHORUS.Thou bonny wood of Craigie lea,Thou bonny wood of Craigie lea,Near thee I pass'd life’s early day,And won my Mary’s heart in thee.The broom, the brier, the birken bush,Bloom bonny o'er thy flowery lea,And a’ the sweets that ane can wish,Frae nature’s hand are strew'd on thee.Thou bonny wood, Ac.Far ben thy dark green plantings’ shade,The

in thee.Thou bonny wood, &c,Tho' fate should drag me south the line,Or o’er the wide Atlantic sea,The happy hours I’ll ever mind.That I in youth ha’e spent in theeThou bonny wood, Ac.LANGSTNE BESIDE THE WOODLANDBURN.Langsynb beside the woodland burn,Amang the broom sae yellow,I loan’d me ’neath the milkwhite thorn,On natures mossy pillow;Around my seat the flow’rs were strew’d,That frae the wildwood I had pu’d,To weave mysel’ a simmer snood,To pleasure my dear fellow1 twin’d the woodbine round the rose,Its richer hues to mellow,Green sprigs of fragrant birk I choseTo busk the sedge sae yellow.The craw-flow’r blue, and meadow pink,I wove in primrose braided link,But little, little did I think,I should have wove the willow.My bonnie lad was forced afar,Toss’d on the raging billow,Perhaps he’s fa’n in bludy war,Or wrecked on rocky shallow;Yet, aye I hope for his return.As round our wonted haunts I mourn,And aftcn by the woodland burn,I pu* the weeping willow.MOLLY, MY DEAR.Tue harvest is o’er, and the lads are so funny,Their hearts lined with love and their pockets wiimoney;From morning till night, ’tis “ My jewel, my honey]“ Och, go to the North with mo, Molly, my dear'Young Dennot holds on with his sweet botheration,i And swears their is only one flower in the nation,“ Thou rose of the Shannon, thou pink of creation," Och, go to the North with me, Molly, my

mjdear.”‘ Though Thady can match all the lads with hisblarney,Lnd sing me love songs of the Lakes of Killarney,In worth from my Dermot he’s twenty miles journey,My heart bids me tell him I’ll ne’er be his dear,”ELLEN MORE.The sun had kissed green Erin’s waves,The dark blue mountains towered between,Mild evening’s dews refreshed the leaves,The moon, unclouded, rose serene:When Ellen wandered forth unseen,All lone her sorrows to deplore;False was her lover, false her friend,And false was hope to Ellen More.Young Henry was fair Ellen’s love,Young Emma to her heart was dear,Nor weal nor woe did Ellen prove,But Emma ever seemed to share:Yet envious still, she spread the wileThat sullied Ellen’s virtues o’er;Her faithless Henry spurned the while,His fair, his faithful Ellen More.She wandered down Loch-Mary side,Where oft at evening hour she stoleTo meet her love with secret pride;Now deepest anguish wrung her soul.O’orcome with grief she sought the steep,Where Yarrow falls with sullen roar;Oh! Pity, veil thy eyes and weep,A bleeding corpse lies Ellen More,The sun may shine on Yarrow braes,And woo the mountain flowers to bloom;But never can his golden raysAwake the flower in yonder tomb.There oft young Henry strays forlorn,When moonlight gilds the abbey tower;There oft from eve till breezy morn,He weeps his faithful Ellen More.COGGIE, THOU HEALS ME.Dorothy sits i’ the cauld ingle neuk,Her red rosy neb’s like a labster tae;Wi’ girning, her mou’s like the gab o’ the fleuk,Wi’ smokin’, her teeth’s like the jet o’ the slae.And aye she sings weels me, aye she sings weels me,Coggie, thou heals me, coggie, thou heals me,Aye my best friend, when there’s ony thing ails meNe’er shall we part till the day that I die.Dorothy ance was a weel tocher’d lass,Had charms like her nei’bours, an’ lovers anew,But she spited them sae, wi’ her pride and her sauce.They left her for thirty lang summers to rue.Then aye f«e sang waes me, aye she sang waes me,0 I’ll turn crazy, 0 I’ll turn crazy,Naething in a' the wide world can ease mo,De’il take the wooers—0 what shall I do.21i )thy, dozen’d wi’ living her lane,t 'u’d at her rock, wi’ the tear in her e’e,11 thought on the braw merry days that were gane,nd caft a wee coggie for company.(r aye she sings weols me, aye she sings weels me,!) y'm thou heals me, coggie thou heals me,my best friend, when there’s ony thing ails me,k »r shall we part, till the day that I die.h■IMY MARY.My Mary is a bonnie lassie,Sweet as dewy morn,When fancy tunes her rural reed,Beside the upland thorn.She lives ahint yon sunny knowe,Where flowers in wild profusion grow,Where spreading birks and hazels throwTheir shadows o’er the burn.’Tis no the streamlet skirted wood,Wi’ a’ its leafy bow’rs,That gars me wait in solitudeAmong the wild sprung flow’rs;But aft I cast a langing e’e,Down frae the bank out-owre the lea,There haply I my lass may see.As through the broom she scours,Yestreen I met my bonny lassieComing frae the town,We raptur’d sunk in ither’s armsAnd prest the breckans down;The paitrick sung his e’ening note,The rye-craik rispt his clam’rous threat.While there the heav’nly vow I got,That erl’d her my own.VYW22KITTY TYRELL.Ths breeze of the night fans the dark mountainbreast,And the light bounding deer have all sunk to thalrest;The big sullen waves lash the loch’s rocky shore.And the lone drowsy fisherman nods o’er his oar;Tho’ pathless the moor, and tho’ starless the skies,The star of my heart is my Kitty’s bright eyes;And joyful I hie over glen, brake, and fell,In secret to meet my sweet Kitty Tyrell.Ah! long we have loved in her father’s despite,And oft we have met at the dead hour of night,When hard-hearted Vigilance, sunk in repose,Gave Love one sweet hour its ftmd tale to disclose.These moments of transport, to me, oh! how dear!And the fate that would part us, alas, how severe!Altko’ tho rudo storm rise with merciless swell,This night I shall meet my sweet Kitty Tyroll.“ Ah! turn, hapless youth, see the dark cloud *death,Comes rolling in gloom o’er the wild haunted heathDeep groans the scathed oak on tho glen’s cliffy bra*And the sound of the torrent seems heavy with woe.Away, foolish seer, with thy fancies so wild,Go tell thy weak dreams to some credulous child,Love guides my light steps rhro’ the lone dreary deliAnd I fly to the arms of my sweet Kitty Tyrell.MINE AIN DEAR SOMEBODY.When gloaming treads the heels of day,And birds sit couring on the spray,Alang the flowery hedge I strayTo meet mine ain dear someb odj.JThe scented brier, the fragrant bean,The clover bloom, the dewy green,A.’ charm me, as I rove at e’en,To meet mine ain dear somebody!

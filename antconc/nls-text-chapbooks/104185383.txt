then your ancient honour fhine.Prepare your arms and form the line.You fee the French they did defign.To overthrow this nation :We’ll iooncr uie than we vid run.While we can (land-with fword and gun,Wcfil fight like ancient Britain’s ions.The raging main with bleed we’ll ftain,1 lie Duke of Ycrk we will maintain.While we have ihot and powder.You fee the Convention did combine.In hopes the viflory to obtain,But brave Lord Howe did them difdain,To o’ Jacobins fnpply them;Our little Ifle will not comply,\WH conquer France or tile wc’li die.' 7 >Our fame fhall echo thro’ the jNever Hy nor quit the held.Till our enemies do yield.The god or war defies them.God blefs our fleets where’er they be,The Duke of York and his army;They could fcheme it particularly.Brave Cobourg and brave Clairfayte ;Likr j(,ife brave Hood that’s in our fleet,And all commanders that are difereet.That’s not afraid their foes to meet,Boldly fight for your right.May your foes be vanquilh’d quite,God lave our troops and feamen.God blefs Great George his Majehy,Our fleets and troops by land and fea,That fight like Britons bold and free,And never will diflemble :Rivers of their blood (hall run.For ever

ray,Invites my fair to rural play,Difpel the mifl, and clear the fkies.And bring my-Orra to my eyes.O were T Cure my dear to view.I'd climb the pine-tree’s topir.oft bough,Ajmoft in air that quivering plays.And round and round for ever gaze.My Orra Moor, where art thou laid ?What wood contains my fleeping maid?Up by the roots enrag'd I’ll tear.The trees that hide my promis’d fair.Oh! could I ride on clouds and Ikies,Or pn the raven's pinions rife ;Ye ftorks, ye fwans, a moment flay,And waft a lover on his way-My blifs, too long, my bride denies,Apace the wafting fummer flies jOr yet the wintry hiafls l fear,Nor ftorcns, or nights Ihall keep me here.What may for ftrength of fled compareOh ! Love has fetters ftronger far ;By bolts of fled are limbs confin’d.But cruel love enchains the mind.No longer then perplex my breafl.When thoughts torment, die firft arc bldl,* Lis mad to go, 'tis death to flay.Away to Orra hafte away.■——     —G L A S G O W,Printed by J 8c M.

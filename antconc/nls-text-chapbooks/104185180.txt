Stood making low obedience to the ground.”p These words of his, they did anger breed ;f They say, must you reign over us indeed ?The like of this was never known before,TThus for his dreams they hated him the more.kHIS SECOND DRE.Soon after this as Joseph sleeping; iuy,!'rec from the toils and troubles of the clay,lie dreamed a second dream, and told the samUnto his brothers, as to them he came ;Sa ving, in sleep appeared before my eyes,The sun, the moon, the seven stars likewise.All making their obedience unto me,kiWith meek and humble humility,ile told it likewise to bis father dear,Who chid him, saying.what is this I hear ?Must I, thy mother, and thy brothers too,Be all obliged to bow the knee to you,Low on the earth, as if you reigned and ruledTis very hard that aged parents shouldA meek and lowly veneration payTo you who ought to honour and obey.!li«i6m il&iilfiliiiK*HE IS PUT INTO A PIT.This very paragraph will clearly showHow they did seek young Joseph’s overthrow.His father sent him to the rural plain,Where with their flocks his brothers did remain.When afar off young Joseph they espied,Behold, here comes the dreamer now, they criedLet us conclude to take his life away,And cast him in a pit without delay.Then see how all his dreams will come to pass:But Reuben, Reuben pitied him, alas iAnd hid him in the pit, there to remain,Till he might safe conduct him home again.What mortal man is able to express,Poor Joseph’s grief when in the wildernessHe lay confined ? no doubt his present tearsCaused his youthful eyes to flow with tears.HJS IS SOLD INTO EGYPT.While in the pit young Joseph lay confined.They sat, diem down to eat, and ere they dinedSome Ishmaelites from Egypt passed by ;Thou Judah made his brothers this reply,“ What shall it .profit to us now, I pray,If we should take this precious life away ?”They all consented to the same with speed.For loth they were to see their brother bleed.Then from the lonesome pit the child they drew.And sold him to those trading merchants, whoA score of silver pieces for him paid.And then to Egypt he was soon conveyed.When Reuben found him not, how did he grieveThe rest contrive their father to deceive,By staining Joseph’s coat with purple blood.Which caused poor Joseph many a weeping flood.TEMPTED BY POTIPHAR’S WIFE.When Joseph to the land of Egypt came,One Potiphar a man of noted fame,Bought him with silver and preferred him straight,Making him steward of his whole estate.I On whom his mistress cast her wanton eyes,| And he reproved her, and said, be wise,, And cast, henceforth, these idle thoughts away-l How can I do that wicked thing, I pray ?1 Now finding her entreaties would not do,I She went to seize him, but away he flew,. Leaving his garment in her hand also :Now from that time she proved his mortal foe;5 She said, my lord, (when he returned at night,)P Thy Hebrew strove with all his might,p To mock thy lady, but was ne’er the near,I l cried, he fled, and left his garment here.18CAST INTO THE DUNGEON.No sooner had she made this false reportOf Joseph’s coming in so vile a sort.But Potiphar immediately he flewInto a sad and cruel passion too,And cast him into prison where he layTill the chief butler and the baker, theyBy Pharaoh’s strict command were sent to beConfined from their former liberty.The baker and the butler both, we find [min'With dreams one night were much disturbed ijWhen they to Joseph did themselves apply,He told them what their dreams did signify ;One he restores unto his former place,The other, he must die in sad disgrace ;‘The butler must his former place supply,The baker by the laws be doomed to die,HB IS MADE LORD OF THE LAND.Still Joseph lay confined in prison fast,Tntil two tedious years were gone and past..t length Pharaoh dreamed, but none in the lan dbuld his dream interpret or understand.'hen the chief butler to the king did say,I needs must own my faults this day :n prison lies a Hebrew servant there,Vho will the truth of all your dreams declare :'hen from a prison to a palace straight,oseph was brought, and Pharoah did relatejdis dreams, and did full satisfaction find,(Vhich eased the grief and anguish of his mind:le gave such satisfaction to the king,That from his royal hand he drew a ring,jhnd gave it Joseph, saying, “ Thou shall b*fext to myself in royal dignity."10IIS BRETHREN GOING TO BUY CORN.Behold the dreams of Pharoah did fortell,V mighty famine, which at length befell jroseph in Egypt was head ruler oyer all;But when his brothers came, and seemed to fallBefore him, straight his dreams came in his mind.Jet he spoke rough, and seemed most unkind :You’re spies said he, they answered, no,We are true men, my lord, pray say not so,iorts of one man, we twelve in number were,The youngest now under his father’s careRemains at home, the other he is not.He knew them, yet his anger seemed hot,A.nd for three days they were in prison cast,Confined they lay, yet Joseph came at last,And laid upon them all a strict command,To bring their young brother oat of hand.11THE CUP IN BENJAMIN’S SACK.When they had eaten up their slender store,Jacob he needs must send them down for more;But knowing that his youngest son must go.His eyes with melting tears did overflow.With presents then they did return again,A-nd Joseph doth them kindly entertain.When he his brother Benjamin beheld,IIis bowels yearned, his heart with joy was filled ;But here’s a grief which did them all surround,The nightly lord, his silver cup was foundOn Benjamin ; this made them sore afraid.That for that crime they would be captives made:Then to the house of Joseph they returned,Judah he pleaded, till hia bowels yearned,To be a captive in hia brother’s room,Lest he should see his father’s threatened doom.12JOSEPH DECLARE Til HIMSELF.“ My lord, hear thy servant now I pray,Our father, when wc brought the child awayExpressed such grief and sorrow for his sake,That if he stay, his aged heart will break :Seeing his tears, which fell like showers of rain,I promised then he should return again.Therefore, my lord, pray let him go, for IAm loth to live to see my father die.”Joseph from tears could now no longer hold:He said, “ I am your brother whom you soldTo Egypt, when on me your anger fell;And is my father yet alive and well?”Then on each other's necks they wept amain.Their cries were heard, from tears could not refraia“ 0 fetch my father hither,” Joseph cried,“ That for the family I may now provide.’’li lie sons of Jacob Pharaoh did command,To take both food and waggons from the landOf Egypt, to fetch their father straight;They did, and poor old Jacob’s joy was greatHe said, still as his spirits did revive,It is enough, Joseph is yet alive,The son for whom I mourned, therefore [Will go and see him now before I die.Then on his journey still he doth proceeu.And in the land of Goshen, there indeedJoseph did meet him, whom he straight did bringInto the royal presence of the king.When Jacob before king Pharaoh stood.His age one hundred and thirty years, a goodOld man was he ;

PAUL.SaTxt Paul, though not one of the twelve, yet foihis great eminence in the ministry of the gospel,had the honour to be styled an apostle, particularlyabove all the rest that were not of the number, andhath justly the next place to St. Peter allotted tahim, both in regard they were so conversant intheir lives, and inseparable in their deaths. Hewas bom at Tarsus, not only of Jewish parents,but originally descended from an ancient Jewishfamily of the tribe of Benjamin in Judea, wherehe had his education, which was a flourishingAcademy, whose scholars (as Strabo testifies) ex¬celled those of Alexandria, and even Athens itself.In the schools of this city, he was brought up fromhis childhood, and became an excellent proficient inall the polite learning of the ancients, yet at the sametime he was brought up to a manual trade, as eventhe most learned of their Rabbins were, for enablingthem to get a livelihood if occasion required it; itbeing a maxim (especially amongst the Jews,) thathe who teacheth not his son a trade, teacheth himto be a thief; for learning of old was not made aninstrument to get a maintenance by, but for thobetter polishing the mind ; so that the learnedamong the Jews were frequently denominated (asDrusius observes,) from some one or other handy-craft trade, as Rabbio Judah, the baker ; RabbieJochanan, the Shoemaker, Ac.Having at Tarsus attained to a great perfectionin the liberal arts and sciences. Ho was sent toJerusalem to be instructed in the knowledge of thelaws ; and for the better accomplishing him in thatstudy, was put under the tuition of Raban Gamalielthe son of Simon, (tho same probably that took upour Saviour in his arms.) He was an eminentdoctor of the law, one of the families of the schools•at Jerusalem, and a person of principal note andauthority in the Jewish Sanhedrim, in which thatgrave and prudent speech, mentioned in the Actsof the Apostles, which lie made on behalf of theapostles and their doctrine, took great effect. Atthe feet of this great doctor St. Paul was broughtup, as he himself testifies ; and by his instructionshe soon advanced to that degree, that he gained him¬self a reputation above all his fellow Scholars.Moreover he was a strict professor of the sect ofthe Pharisees, which of all others amongst the Jews,' was the severest and most magisterial ; and theprofessors thereof, generally great applauders ofthemselves for their sanctity, despising and censur¬ing all others as reprobates, and unworthy of theirsociety, and presuming (as Josephus writes) togovern even princes themselves. With the fierygenius of this sect, our apostle was too deeply in¬fected, which made him a most zealous persecutorof the Saints ; so that when the blood of the martyrStephen was shed, I (saith ho with sorrow after hisi1 conversion) was standing by, consented to his death,I and kept the raiment of them that slew him. Nay,I of all the apparators, and inquisitors, employed bythe Sanhedrim, to execute their warrants ; uponthose upstart heretics, as they called them, whopreached against the law of Moses, and the traditionof the fathers; he was the man that strove to bethe forwardest. In this zeal to execute his office,as he was on his way to Damascus, with some othersof his fellow officers, breathing out vengeance anddestruction against the poor Christians, their was; on a sudden a most glorious light shot full uponhim, and the rest that were with him, so that theyfell to the ground in great amazement, and at thesame time a voice from heaven was directed to him,saying, “ Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me ?’to which, amazed aa no was, he answered. Lordwho art thou ? the voice replying, that it was Jesuswhom he persecuted, and that it was hard for himto kick against the pricks. He again desired furtherinstructions ; Lord, said he, what wilt thou have meto do; upon which he was bid to rise, and go toDamascus, and there expect what should be furtherrevealed to him ; rising from the ground he foundhis sight gone. In this plight being led to Damas¬cus, he was there three days fasting, and probablythen he saw that celestial vision mentioned by him,wherein he heard and saw things past utterance,and those divine revelations, which gave himoccasion to say, that the gospel he preached, he wasnot taught by man, but had it revealed to him byJesus Christ. The three days being expired", jAnanias, a devout man, and one of the seventy |!disciples came to him, according to the commandhe had received from our Lord, who appeared tohim, to go and enquire for one Saul of Tarsus, and |having laid his hands on him, told him his message, jupon which his sight was restored to him, and the j Igift of the Holy Ghost conferred on him ; presently 1 jafter he was baptized, and made a member of thechurch, to the great joy of the rest of the disciples, jthat he should become not only a professor, but apreacher of that faith, which he so lately was a ibitter persecuter of. His stay at this time at Damas¬cus was not long, for being warned away by avision from heaven, he took a journey into Arabia,where he preached the gospel for three years, and j)then returned to Damascus, where the unconverted |Jews eagerly sought his ruin, endeavouring to seize j.him, but he escaped through the help of the disciples, liand the rest of his friends who wore zealous forihis safety.Thus far we have made an entrance into the lifetjland acts of this great anostle, with which there isljscarcely any thing equally memorable in historynor could the further prosecution thereof hare beenomitted, but that all the travels of this apostle inthe pursuance of his ministry, from the time of hisconversion to the last of his being at Rome, withthe most principal transactions, and the severestaccidents that happened to him therein, are alreadyrelated in the exposition of the map of the voyage*of the apostles, and more particularly those of StPaul, in which, for avoiding needless repetitions,the sequel of his life may not unfitly be referred.We shall therefore make some enquiry into thetime and occasion of the several epistles wrote tothe several churches; as also unto the time andmanner of his deathWhen he went from Athens to Corinth, it is saidhe wrote his first epistle to the Thessalonians,which he sent Silas and Timothy, who returnedduring his stay, and before his departure he wrotehis second epistle to them, to excuse his not comingto them as he promised in his first. Not long afterat Ephesus, he is said to have written his epistle to theGalatians ; and before he left Ephesus, he wrotehis first epistle to the Corinthians. Moreover, hesent from thence by Apollos and Silas to Titus,whom he left in that island to propagate the faith,and had him made bishop thereof, in which liegives him advice for the better execution of hisepiscopal office. At Macedonia, whither he wentfrom Ephesus, having by Titus received an accountof the church of Corinth’s present state of affairs,he sent by him at his return, when he was accom¬panied by St. Luke, his second epistle to theCorinthians ; and about the same time ho wrote hisfirst epistle to Timothy, whom he had left atEphesus. From Corinth he wont to Macedon,whither he sent his epistle to the Romans, byPhebe, a deaconess of the Church of Cenchrea, not22far from Corinth. Going thence to Rome, he senthis epistle to the Phillipiana bj Epaphroditus, whohad been sent from them with relief, not knowingto what straits he might be reduced by his im¬prisonment at Rome. In the next place, he sendsby Tychicus his epistle to the Ephesians. Notlong after, (if not about the same time) he wrotehis epistle to the Colossians, and sent it byEpaphras, his fellow-prisoner for some time atRome. As for his second epistle to Timothy,there is some dispute about the time of his writingit; only it seems probable by authentic authors,that it was written after the Philippians andEphesians As for the epistle to the Hebrews, itis not known when, or from whence written, andrather conjectured than certainly known to harebeen St. Paul’s. Tertulliah judgeth it to be writ¬ten by Barnabas; but the most received opinion9 is, that it was St. Paul’s, but written by him inHebrew, and so sent to the Jews ; but for the betterpublishing it to the Gentiles, translated into Greek,some say by St. Luke, and others by St. Clement,for the style of whose epistles to the Corinthiansand Ephesians is observed by St. Jerome to comevery near the style of this epistle, and to contain apurer vein of Greek than is found in the rest of St.Paul’s epistles.Our apostle having been now two years a prisonerat Romo, is at length set free, and soon after de¬parts to visit other parts of the world, for thefurther divulging the gospel, but into what par¬ticular parts is variously conjectured ; some thinkinto Greece, and some parts of Asia, where he hadnot yet been ; others will have it that he wentpreaching, as well into the Eastern as Westernparts of the world; for in his epistle to the Corin¬thians it is said, that Paul being a preacher bothEaatward and Westward, taught righteousness to23rthe whole world, and went to the utmost bounds otthe West. That he went into Spain, may begathered both from his own words, as intimatingI so to do, and also from the testimony of otherauthors, as Theodoret, who writes, that ho not onlywent into Spain to preach, but brought the gospel into[ the isles of the sea, and particularly iuto ourisland of Britain ; and more particularly in anotherplace, he reckons up the Gauls and the Britonsamongst those people to whom the apostles, andespecially the tent-maker, as he calls him, had; divulged the Christian faith.Farther mention of St, Paul we find none till hjs; next and last coming to Rome, which is said to beabout the 8th and 9th years of Nero’s feign; andhe came in the fittest time to suffer martyrdom hocould have chosen ; for whereas at other times, hisprivilege of being a Roman citizen gained himj those civilities which common morality could notdeny him, he had to do with a person with whomthe crime of being a Christian weighed down allapologies that could be alledged; a person whomlewdness and debauchery had made seven timesmore a Pagan than any custom or education couldhave done. What his accusation was, cannot be cer¬tainly determined, whether it was his being anassociate with St. Peter in the fall of Simon Magus,or his conversion of Poppiea Sabina, one of thoEmperor’s concubines, by which he was curbed inthe career of his insatiate appetite. Neither can itbe resolved how long he remained in prison, whattho certain time of his suffering was, and whether(according to the custom) he was first scourged ;only Barentons speaks of two pillars in the churchof St. Mary, beyond the bridge in Rome, to whichboth he and St. Peter were bound, when they were■courged.It it affirmed that St. Paul and St, Peter suffered24upon the same day, though different kinds of death,Others will have it that they suffered on the sameday of the year, hut at a year’s distance ; and othersaffirm that St. Paul suffered several years after St.Peter ; hut all agree that Paul, as a Roman, had |the favour to be beheaded, and not crucified. His jexecution was at the Aqua* Salvia?, 3 miles from 1Rome ; and he is said to have converted the threesoldiers that guarded him thither, who also sufferedfor the faith. Some of the fathers add, that uponhis death there flowed from his veins a liquor morelike milk than blood, the sight whereof (saith St.Crysostom) converted the executioner.He was buried about two miles from Rome, in ;the way called Via, Ostiensis, where Lucina, a nobleRoman matron, not long after settled a farm forthe maintenance of the church. Here he lay butindifferently entombed for several ages, till thereign of Constantine the Great, who in the year ofour Lord, 318, at the request of Sylvester, bishopof Rome, built a very sumptuous church, supportedwith a hundred stately pillars, and beautified witha most rare and exquisite workmanship, and afterall richly gifted and endowed by the emperor him¬self. Yet was all this thought too mean au honourfor so great an apostle by the emperor Yalentinian,who sent an order to his Prsefect Salustinus, totake that church down, and to erect in its room onemore large and stately, which, at the instance of thePope Leo, was richly adorned, and endowed by theEmpress Placidia, and doubtless, hath receivedgreat additions ever since, from ago to age.Thus was brought up, became converted, and a ppreacher of the gospel, and thus was put to death Iand buried, this great apostle of the Gentiles, J|superior in learning aud natural parts, and notj;inferior in zeal to any of the rest of the apostles.I

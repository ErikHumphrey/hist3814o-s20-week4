This disaster, however, far transcends:every thing- of the kind that has yet happened inany place of worship in Scotland ; and whether;we consider the occasion on which it befel thehapless victims, the sudden and immediate des-1truction of life of which it was productive, or the.still more dreadful and appalling devastation:which might have ensued, there can be no doubt |that it ought to be regarded, and will long be 'remembered, as one of the most awful dispensa-ntions of Providence, and at the same time onejiof the most impressive and memorable examplesjl3the precarious and uncertain tenure of huniaurrstence. The principal facts, which have beenlixtoftsiv and industriously collected upon the>ot, may be very shortly told.Being the Commnnion Sabbath in Kirkcaldy,e parish church, as generally happens on suchicasions, was fuller than ordinary throughoute early part of the day ; and it being understoodat the Rev. Edward Irving, of the Caledonianhapel, London, the'son-in-law of the clergymand formerly a resident in Kirkcaldy, was toirform the evening service, a great additional;>wd, impelled by curiosity or other motives,:ked to hear that celebrated person. The con-uence was, that after the doors were opened,d the bell had rung for about ten minutes,very part of the church was filled, and numbersere standing in the passages ; but it was notrowded to suffocation,” as has been erroneous-cistated. At this moment, however,—-that isiut two or three minutes before the service wasshommence, and close upon six o’clock,—thewle-of the north-western range of galleries,“Ithe right side of the pulpit, extending to ra-r more than fifty feet in length, yielded tomi unusual pressure of the multitude it support-, and fell, with a tremendous crash, upon thev more hapless assemblage underneath. Thej. t-indication of the catastrophe was given byjn Spear’s gallery, which is the centre division* he range ; and a gentleman who occupied it,just remarked that he felt the gallery sink--T when, instantly, the whole mass was pre*4eipitatt'd downwards with a tremendous crashthose persons in the front having- been thrownibackwards, and those behind forwards, so that!by far the greater number fell head-foremost,amongst the rafters, beams, and rubbish into thatpart of the church which is immediately below.At this moment the scene was indescribablyterrific and appalling. A dense cloud of dustinstantly arose, and for a few seconds envelopedthose who were overwhelmed amidst the wreck)in its suffocating- volume. Shriek^ screams,*groans, and «xcIamations of all sorts, inter-j,mingled with the voices of individuals callingjaloud for help, or attempting to allay the con-1sternation, and counsel the multitede againstrushing suddenly to the doors, how rose in mostheart-reading dissonance. But the dreadfulpanic was not to be stayed. On the contrary,the multitude, impressed with a momentaryconviction that the whole range of gallerieswhich sweep round the church would tumbledown, made a simultaneous rush to the doors,tearing up and breaking down every thing,which obstructed their progress. , ^The fatal consequences which have ensuedfrom this accident were not so much occasioned,by the accident itself as by the terror whicij ,|seized on the people, when they beheld the falof thq galleries. According to the most accurate- estimate, there were in the galleries thagave way upwards of 250 people, includingthose-who were in the passages, and about aiequal number underneath, there being in thii5pawner about 500 persons exposed to the ir«-ohediate consecjuences of the accident. Thoseiho were in these galleries escaped generallyIMth bruises and contusions more or less severe;aid of those who were under them, only threeersons, Mrs Beveridge and two others, as fars we can learn, actually lost their lives by thekll of the joists above them. The former wastilled on the spot, while two blind boys, her{pin sous, who were seated beside her, escapednhurt. It was stated that she was in the actf leaning forward when one of the joists fell,ud rested on her neck, which was pressed onhe other side against the top of a pew.The casualties would in this manner have beenomparatively few, if the rest of the congrega-ion had retained sufficient presence of mind tomve remained for a little time in their seats.But tliis in a mixed multitude of men, women,md children, having along with them, in many;ases, their nearest relatives, for whom theywere even more anxious than for themselves,iSvas hardly to be expected ; and, accordingly,s soon as the crash took place, they rushed, aslive have already noticed, in the wildest conster¬nation to the doors, and through the windows,and many were suffocated or trampled to death,larticularly at the bottom of the gallery stairs,md in the vestibule, where there was a pressure>'rom three opposite points, namely, the twoigallery stairs, and the body of the church. Theoerils of this dreadful struggle for life were per-|ilaps increased by another circumstance, which||was, that the friends of individuals, fathers andmothers who had children, or aged and helplessrelatives in the church, some of whom wereknown to have fallen down, made anxious exer¬tions for their safety, by endeavouring-, though ;in vain, to stem the human torrent that wasrolling over them. The temporary stoppageswhich these fruitless efforts occasioned, onlyrendered the multitude behind tnora desperate,and more determined to force their way out, anetheir power was resistless—most of those who lfell, fell to rise no more.Many escaped through the windows, which iare nearly all broken ; and from those on thegallery stairs, which were broken open by the ibeadle from the outside, part of the crowd rolled rout, and were dragged from beneath to prevent .others falling- above them. Here also severalaccidents took place, some of them severe. Itis remarkable, that many, who have escaped!with no injury, have no recollection whateverof wl a took place, or how they escaped. Itwould seem, that the terrors of the scene had fona time estranged their mental faculties ; severalwere taken away actually deranged, and manystill labour under a disturbed nerveus excitement*which will take some time to subside.Such persons as had sufficient fortitude to re-1main in their pews escaped unhurt. Several!;who were under the gallery when it fell, pros-itrated themselves in the pews, and also susr< rtained no injury.—Many reached the open air iin a state approaching to nakedness their elothesiibeing literally torn off them.7When the tumult had in some measure sub¬sided, and the bodies of the dead and dying hadi ibeen brought out and laid upon the greenswardt>f the graves at the north-west angle of theihhurch, a scene of a more mournful, and stillimore withering description ensued. Such ailiumber of human beings, some in the first blushpf life, the greater proportion in the prime andKj/igour of their years, hurried in one moment of(Wild strife and .agony into eternity, was of itselfiiiuflficient to shake the firmest nerves, and to ap-Jaal the stoutest heart. But there were manyaccessory circumstances calculated, if possible,co make a still deeper impression, and to strain‘i|the chords of feeling to the very highest pitch.There, at that moment of unspeakable horror,might be seen parents suddenly bereft of children,rfchildren deprived of theii parents, brothersbending over the dead bodies of their sisters,’ land sisters over those of their brothers, theclonely widow gazing in speechless agony at the^inanimate frames of those she best loved, amiwho formed her sole comfort and stay, withicrowds of relatives, and persons of all classes,reither bewailing a loss, or awaiting in dreadful(suspense the announcement of some bereave-rnent; while the anxious and too often unavail-j« ing efforts of the surgeons, surrounded as theyn were with every form and manifestation of griefu in all its bitterness, and with the dissonant butid heart-rending cries of parental, filial, or fraternalin lamentation, formed altogether a picture of deepill and real tragedy such as it is more easy to8itHaijtiie than pmirtray. Oti the hearts andminds of those who witnessed it, it is written ineharactersjiever to be effaced ; and it is impos¬sible to listen to their simple and adectiag des-oriptions without the strongest emotion. Theextent of the loss actually sustained, however,may now be considered as pretty accuratelydetermined.The number of killed in all amounted to twenty-eight ; and some of these were attended withcircumstances peculiarly affecting:-Three youngwomen of the name of Mathevvson, and acousin whom they had with them, were allburied in one grave.—They were the solesupport of their mother, who is left in very des¬titute circumstances. So dreadfully was sheoverwhelmed by this unexpected and heavycalamity, that fear was entertained for her life.A young lady, a stranger, had in the firstmoment of alarm effected her escape, but re¬turned in search of her mother, and perished.Besides those who were either killed cnthe spot or died soon afterwards, about 150persons have more or less suffered from the in¬juries they received on this melancholy occasion ;and many persons were confined to bed onTuesday and yesterday who had been walkingabout all Monday. It is a remarkable cir¬cumstance, that so few of those injuries are of a |serious nature, but some of them threaten toprove fatal. There are only two cases of frac¬ture, one of the collar-bone, and the other of theneck of the thigh-bone, but the patients, both !9vomen, are doing well. This must excite the].stO!iishinent of everyone who examines the ap¬pearances which the church still presents. Inhe desperate struggle to get out many of theioors of the pews have been broken, book-boardsnave been torn up, and wherever there was anycorner or projection which could be seized holdnf, it is torn down. The pressure, indeed, ap¬pears to have be.n so enormous in many parts,i hat it overthrew every thing which came in itsway ; and all those who were caught in its vor-;;ex had their clothes more or less torn, whileionic reached the open air almost in a state ofnakedness. Fragments, chiefly of female dress, as(pits of silk, broken combs, and ether smallarticles, were scattered about the church, evenon Tuesday, after every thing of value had• been removed—and sufficiently attested the na¬ture and extent of the death struggle which had• taken place. Besides, a considerable number:lof persons escaped, or rather was forced out,through the windows, particularly that of theBlstaircase leading to the south gallery ; and as• the descent in all cases were several feet in• •height, and the violence with which they were• ejected extreme, the fewness of fracture is trulyFtonishing. One man, indeed, was less fortn-ite. Standing in the southern gallery, ir«-irmediately after the crash, and as if fascinated bydthe horror of the scene before him, he leapedilthrough a window down into the area, and fellii prostrate, but he immediately recovered himself,it and springing to his feet, as if wholly un-10Imrt, uttered some inarticulate expression, arc lthen instantly dropped down and expired,Several persons succeeded in getting out of thisgallery by the window immediately to the left o' Lthat now mentioned, and descending on the tof Lof a small portico a little below the sill, reachecthe area of the church-yard without injury.A variety of remarkable and some almostmiraculous escapes were mentioned to us,Mr , surgeon, Kirkcaldy, was in the bodj 'of the church when the gallery fell; but hi#family and his sister-in-law, were in the galleryat the moment of the crash, and for a time ,literally buried in the ruins ; yet most fortunate¬ly they escaped unharmed from their periloussituation. The family of Dr   was innearly the same terrible plight, and had equalgood fortune. Mr  , innkeeper, and hisdaughters, were also involved amidst the raftersand rubbish, yet escaped with a few trifling bruises.1 he front work of the gallery, after yielding alittle outwards before the crash, having remainedstanding, thirty-six individuals dung to it, andwere saved. Several persons were observed to;seize hold of and suspend themselves from the1chandeliers, by which means they escaped being;entangled in the rush, and were thus preserved.,A little girl, daughter of Mr , effected heyescape by a union of agility and presence of ),mind which we heard warmly eulogised byseveral who had witnessed it; and various other tinstances of a similar kind were stated to us.IfAmongst the numbers who were trodden downr11it the bottom of the fatal stair-case, we have on-y heard of one man who has survived, liy the«ijpressure and the suffocating heat and dust, thisjerson was rendered insensible ; but when extri-:ated, and removed to the open air, he recoveredill little, then vomited freely, and is now out- ofill danger. It is remarkable* too, that thosearsons who were in the gallery which fell,generally escaped with bruises and contusionsnore or less severe ; and those who had theirmness and presence of mind to keep their seatswere nearly all, we believe, equally fortunate.In fact, this was their only, or at all events theirlest ehance of safety j but, unhappily, a multfeiiiude. under the influer.ce of tbs wildest conster¬nation, is insensible to every motive or feelingMxcept the panic by which it is actuated, andrushes blindly into the jaws of the very destruc-;::ion which the brute impulse of fear impels it toiihun. In this case the rush was rendered still' riore tremendous, and the mortality increased,'py the friends of individuals who had fallen, try¬ing to stem the human torrent that was rollingover them. After each momentary stoppage,L burst forth anew with resistless fury, and thefenerous efforts to save only added to the num-fc*r of victims.ouch is a faint and imperfect account of thisuly deplorable calamity, which has plungeddVirkcaluy and its neighbourhood into mourning,and excited u strong sensation wherever thenpeWs of it has reached. To ascribe it, however,to the crowd which had assembled upon this12occasion would be equally erroneous and unjust, jThe real cause was the utter insufficiency ot’the :church, particularly the g-alleries, as will incon- ■testably appear from the following particulars.iThis edifice, which is modern, was built in1807, twenty-one years ago. The contractorwas a person named Alexander Macfarlane, a 5Wright from Perth ; and amongst other things, >it was one of the specifications of his contract <that the transverse joists or beams of the gallery >should be inserted into the walls while building.Accordingly, when the latter had attained therequisite height, he applied for the timbers to awood merchant in Kirktaldy, but being unableto give security for the payment of the price, •they were refused ; and the church was built ;<and roofed in, in direct violation of this part of »his compact, and without any means having ;been provided in the shape of a wall-plate 1or otherwise, either for the insertion or supportof these all-important beams. Hence, when •they were procured, they appear to have been 1rather laid against the wall than inserted in it, 1the holes in which the extremities were placed <were scarcely an inch deep ; and, in some cases,it is evident they have been found too short farthis, as we observed several joists which hadnot reached the wall at all, and were attacnedto it solely by a thin narrow plate of iron witha few nails. Nor is this even all. The lowerextremities of these transverse beams or joistsrested upon a longitudinal beam, supported bypillars, which runs along the front of the gallery;13mt here the same reckless rapacity, or rather;pii it of culpable homicide by anticipation, hasineeri at work. The grooves or notches in theonoitudinal beam forreceivingthe lower ex-: reniities of the cross beams are only an inch"sleep at the upper part, and scarcely a quarter ofin inch at the lower ; so that if the front of thegallery had by any accident been deflected halfin inch from the perpendicular, the destruction•f the whole was inevitable. When the churchivas “finished,” as it was called, this Macfarlaneiiad become bankrupt, and the litigation, we be-ieve, took place between his creditors and therijieritors of the parish as to its sufficiency ; the^Consequence of which was, that the whole was(referred to a builder, who, confining his exami¬nation to the mason-work, reported it as suffi-ident ; but the heritors never, we understand,"received any report as to the sufficiency of theicarpenters’ and joiners’ work; and it is noto¬rious that the galleries have all along been con¬sidered insecure and dangerous. So very gene¬ral was this apprehension some years ago, thatit was found necessary to put in two additional(ipillars immediately behind those at the extremi¬ties of the semicircle facing the pulpit; and hadat not been for this slight precaution, the wholemvould unquestionably have tumbled down onliSumlay last, and buried hundreds more in itsiiruins. As it is, the whole of the southern^gallery is damaged ; the transverse beams haveijjevidently been drawn by the shock from theirijlshallow sockets; the lath and plaster are broken;u;uid the whole ready to fall with the slightestconcussion. Nay more, we have not a shadowof doubt in our mind, that had the congregationon Sunday been fairly assembled before theaccident of the west gallery took place, the con¬cussion usually produced by the rising of themultitude to prayer, would have occasioned thedownfal of the entire range, and led to a ca¬lamity incomparably more dreadful than eventhat which lias actually occurred.The following measurements and calculationswill perhaps serve to give our ac/tu7G7 iuea or the nature and extent of the ac¬cident than any description, however minute.The galleries swept round three sides of thechurch, which is in form a parallelogram. Theportion immediately in front of the pulpit, whichstands at the northern end or gable, is a semi¬circle, from the extremities of which two sides,each abollt fifty or fifty-one feet in length, runlongitudinally in a parallel direction along thewhole church. The average horizontal breadthef each of those sides is about sixteen feet, andthey ore raised at nti angle of from SO to 83degrees. The one which gave way on Sundaylast was that on the right hand of the pulpit,which is towards the west; and from the sidewhich still remains we find that it must havecontained 21 seats in all, each fitted to hold eightpersons with perfect ease and comfort. But asthe church was crowded, let us suppose thatthere were ten persons in each seat, and fortystanding in the passages. This we know to beic\\(:ii■|Iiic15iia moderate computation ; and ^ gives 250 in-I. dividuals in the part of the gallery which fell,r. At a low calculation there iimst have been fullyilan equal number immediately underneath; so:!: that, at the moment of the catastrophe, probablylimore than 500 human beings were buried in theruin and havoc with which the rapacity of aneedy or unprincipled contractor, and the unac¬countable negligence of the legal conservators ofthe edifice are alone chargeable. From the ap¬pearances presented by the wreck it seems evi-! dent that the immediate cause of the accidentwas the yielding of the longitudinal beam into! which the lower extremities of the joists were soclJo-titlv Jneprted ; in consequence of which th"*-" ' - —jcjrslipped out of the sockets, and the whole camedown, with the exception of this beam and thei front work attached to it, which seems to havei instantly after recovered its vertical position,L The church was originally calculated to contain11600, and it is supposed that upwards of 1800: persons were within its walls at the time wheni: the catastrophe took place.(The panic and consternation which prevailedin Kirkcaldy when the lamentable news firstspread is indescribable ; and the town continuedin a state of great agitation throughout thewhole of Monday. In the course of that dayli the Council Chamber was crowded with peoplejl claiming hats, shawls, trinkets, bibles, and otherarticles which had been lost in the tumult ; andthe Provost w ith a number of other gentlemen,t ft were indefatigable in tkeir endeavours to satis*16fy the numerous claimants. Immediately afterthe disaster the special constables were calledout, and continuing- on duty throughout the 4whole of Monday, Tuesday, and part of yester- jday, these gentlemen have been of the greatest vuse in preserving and effecting the restorationof property.The exertions of Drs Johnston and Chalmers :to give medical assistance to the unfortunate ?sufferers was beyond all praise. They blednumbers in the church-yard, and throughout the ;whole night went from house to house, giving rethat relief and advice which their eminent »talents so well enabled them to afford.On Tuesday evening the. scene to j«one of a more mournful character. Oh that :day we witnessed no less than ten funerals in iKirkcaldy; and in one of these four bodies, ;being those of the Mathewsons and their cousinAnn Smith, were at once conveyed to the ■church-yard, and deposited in the same grave.One uninformed of the cause might have taken vthis town for a “ city of the plague/' and sup- •posed that the frequent sombre processions which *met him at every turn, were escorting the vie- •tims of an unsparing pestilence to their last rest- •.ing-plaee. All these funerals, though of per- ■sons in the lower ranks of life, were attended ispontaneously and uninvited by the venerable .Provost and all the respectable people of the ►place. While standing in the church-yard, look¬ing at the interment of one of the corpses, wewere much affected with the simple appeal made17»y an old man to the persons who had escortedt to the burying-ground :—“ Any of you, gen-demen, who are disengaged will be so good asfjo down and help to bring up Tliomas Watson’svife.”Mr Irving was desirious to preach, onMonday night, in the church-yard, and was>nly dissuaded from so doing by the remon-.trances of the very respectable Provost of the>urgh. On Tuesday he was also desirious to)reach in the church-yard, or in an adjoiningbark, but was prevented by the state of theveather from such an exhibition, which was in‘very respect uncalled for, and entirely at variancewith the feelings of the people. We may add,itiowever, that Mr Irving was extremely activein rendering assistance when the accident hap¬pened ; and that he has been equally humanerand liberal in visiting, and rendering pecuniaryassistance when it was required.At a meeting, which was numerously and res-opectably attended, the situation of the survivingrelations of some of the unfortunate suffererswas taken into consideration; and a committee,i(consisting of the Magistrates and three othergentlemen, was appointed to afford what pecu¬niary or other relief they might judge necessary.IA subscription for this purpose has been opened;Hand so far as distress can in this way be alle¬viated, we hope it will be liberally administered.ISSunday after the Accident.I ■ ^The tragic scene that occurred last Sunday ithis town has excited an interest unparalleled iits annals. This day week all were in lugspirits, expecting to hear one of the theologicalstars of the age. How quickly was the spiriiwere, in the short space of a few minutes, exl;tended cold and lifeless on the ground ; thj »mother was heard wailing her lost child, th(| 1widow her husband, and the friend was seejfclinging to the inanimate body of him that was]dear to him as a brother, refusing to be separated,for he could not believe the extent of hisloss. Seven have since died, but we can nowstate that all the injured are in a fair way ofrecovery ; and must add, that it is now matterof surprise that the calamity did not provemurh greater than it really was.An architect has since surveyed the southgallery, and was astonished to finds ome ■of the joists altogether off the great beam, 11—having no other support to prevent their fallthan the nails that attached them to the floor <above. Farther, he observed that the pillarswhich support the beam of what was the northgallery, are not placed in its centre, but towardsthe outer angle.This dayMrMartinpreaehedintheforenoonfrom ia tent, to a considerable audience assembled in aof the dream changed into mourning Somtwho were in the bouyancy of youthful spirits.19mall park adjoining the church-yard ; and there;ras a sermon in the evening at Abbotshall.The object of this arrangement was, that, as somenight be un willing or unable to attend divine wor¬ship in the open air, all might be accommodated ;|VI r Martin took for his text the words in Luke,di.—1<0 “Be ye therefore ready also.” 1 he;>ther clergymen of the town also embraced thenccasion to dwell on the uncertain tenure of hu¬man life, and the mysterious dispensations of.'Providence. One chose as the subject of hisdiscourse, “ Shall there be evil in a city, and themrd hath not done it and another, the fall ofhe tower ofSiloam.The number of new-made graves in the church-ard was an impressive spectacle. This spot is in-ayested with a deep and melancholy interest, and thearge mound raised above the sisters Mathevvsons,rrests the attention of all. H ere may be seen near-|y twenty “ brown hillocks” where last Sundaygrew the greensward. The awful stil ness of thek scene is an eloquent picture of death, and the frailty)f man ; and cold indeed must be the heart thatjean withstand its monitory impulses. The'most of the people appeared in mourning ; a(solemnity was marked in almost every face; anhAve, as if all were sensible that some dire con¬vulsion had bereaved them of some of their1 dearest relatives. It may be worthy of notice,(that several, particularly females, who wrerecarried home in a state of .stupor, on coming toI their senses, had not the slightest recollection ofthe tragic scene in which they had been sharers.20Farther Particulars.One of the first persons who discovered thedang-er was Mr Edward Sang. He sat imme¬diately under the longitudinal beam of the galleryand a small quantity of dust falling upon him,which was followed by particles of lime, he look¬ed up, and observing the whole mass of the floorcoming down, as it were in a body, he made a,desperate spring forward, and alighted in a pas¬sage through which the minister enters from thevestry to- the pulpit. By the time he had reach¬ed this spot the whole had fallen.—A little boy,about eight years of age, made a singular escape.His mother was crushed against the wall, butstill held him in her hand. In the confusion,she lost her hold of him, and naturally supposedhe had perished. But when one of the bodieswas drawn out, the boy was found unhurt, amirolled up in a mantle attached to the corpse.—One individual, who lost a daughter, had hiswhole family with him .in his scat, which was iiin the centre of the church, and he had the pre¬sence of mind to remain till the confusion wasover. He endeavoured to calm the alarm of hisfamily, and to keep them together ; but when hereached the door the first object he beheld wasthe corpse of his daughter stretched on a tomb- |stone.—Another, a tall and powerful man, with |a boy by his side, at the request of some others,pushed forward to pull open the bolts of the southdoor, and returning in search of his son, foundhim on the floor trampled to death by the verypersons in whose behalf he had so generously 1;21exerted himself. His appearance 'when he sawrwhat had befallen his son is said to have been be-lyond description heart-rending.—Sarah Penmanwho was before peculiarly unfortunate, havinglost her fensbaml and son both by violent deaths.within two years, was m church with her son,an infirm lad. She was seen in the utmost agonycrying** My puir object, my puir laddie/’ andto rush into the densest part of the crowd toassist him. He escaped with trifling injury,i but the unfortunate mother was trampled to deathund so dreadfully mangled as only to he recog-: nised by the colour of her gown. The same; was the condition of many of the other bodies ;nand many bore no marks at all of external vio-|pence. One woman, had merely a mark on her(breast, as if it had been pressed by a heavy ironnishod shoe. _*The following lines, occasioned by this dreadfulI (catastrophe, are the effusion of a pious and amiableaheart, and exhibit poetical powers of no common rate.But yesterday,.(On such a Sabbath, holy, cool, serene,j A Christian flock had met, with pious hearts,) To feast as the disciples of their Saviour,! .i And eat of the Last Supper, which to manyWas in sad truth the last ; and they ere fill’dWith holy things, and praised their gloriousGod ;And ere the sun should set, they came once moreThe sacred words of life to hear, and strengthenThe vows of virtue which their hearts had paid.Sure, they were ripe in faith and strong in hope,nAnd every taint of earth had vanishedAs their renewed souls drew near to God ?And kindred faces sat in love together.,Beaming' affection ; brother smiled on sister,Mother on son, and father on his daughter,What looks of holiness, that seem’d to say,Are we not truly blest?—"and some,perchance.Look’d wistfully towards that happy timeWhen old and young, in their appointed season.Together gather'd by the reaper, Death,Should live for ever in the light of Heaven,Of which tliis earthly foretaste was so sweet;And their full hearts, perchance, were warmlybreathing,—“ How pleasant are thy tabernacles, Lord !With mercy’s oil my head thou hast anointed ;My cup o’erflows even in the wilderness ;Yea, though I wander through the dreary valeOf death’s dark shadow, I will fear no evil ;—For thou, oh Lord, art with me, and thy rodAnd staff they comfort me.—Yea all my life,Goodness and mercy, sure, shall follow me.And I shall dwell within the House of GodFor evermore.”Hark, whence arose that shriekOf agony ! that fearful, dreadful crash 1That hum of many voices in despair !How stream the people from the fated temple.With looks of horror,—wildly—wildly gazing fYe who desired to be with God, are there !His house was your last earthly dwelling-place yHis mercy, your last meal ; his sacred blood.Your latest cup } the cup of death, the gate28Of life beyond the grave ; your last supportdis staff; his rod of chastisement, salvation fNo pang was yours ; death came untold, nn-dream’d,lit once, and ye are sleeping.—Shall we mourn?Vere not ye ripe for death3—Ah, ye havegamedblessed lot J to sop> in Paradise !Jot yours to' see those whom ye loved on earth■oru from your arms- by withering decay ;fo feel the Imrsthrg heart, when broke the tie'hat bound you to the dead,—Noy ye are notn death divided,—brother died with sister,ilother with son, and father with his daughter j'ogether did your hearts aspire to Heav’n ;'ogether are your souls before your God !Sleep peacefully ; ye blessed martyrs, sleep;nd wake in blessedness.

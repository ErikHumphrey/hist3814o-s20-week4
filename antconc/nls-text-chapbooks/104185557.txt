Herethey refieshed themselves for four days, and thebSSveigheu anchor, the wind being fair at full south,Fond traded at severaf ports on the coast of Peru,hili, and Mexico. From Port Aqttapulco theysailed, having a fresh breeze, at N. N. E Theyhad not sailed above one day before the windveered to the south-west, and blew a violent gale,and there being a great sea, so that their shiptook in a great deal of water, the wind continu¬ing two days increasing to a very great storm,* which held for one day and two nights more;ing which time they perceived themselves, near some rocks fhe storm rather increasing,and it growing dark, they despaired of saving theShip; and as the main-yard could not lower, theship’s tackling bepg disorded by the violence ofthe storm; Ouarle, being bold and active, took ahatchet whfch tumbled about the deck, and ranup the shrouds, in order to cut down what stoptthe working of the main-yard, but by that timehe was got up, there came a sea which aashed,the ship to shatters against the rock; and withthe violence of the shock, flung Quarle, who wasastride upon the main-yard, on the top of the rock,where, having the good fortune to fall in a clift,he was hindered from being washed back againinto the sea and drowned, as every body werethat belonged to the ship.Quarle, in a dismal condition, remained the.succeeding night in the clift, being continuallybeaten with the dashing back of the sea, and b*- -mg both bruised and numbed, • pulled oft his.clothes, which were dripping wet, and spreadtheqain the sun; and being over-fatigued, lays himselfdown on the smoothest place of the rock he couldfind, being quite spent with the hardships he hadundergone, and slept while his clothes were dry-ing. .When he awoke, he stared about him m n.frightful manner, expecting every minute sonaecreature to devour him; but, taking a little cou¬rage, put on his cl’Othes, which by this time wer ^quite dry; he then looks about him, but,alas! couldfsee notuing but the dreadful effects of the latetempest, dead corpses, broken planks, and bat¬tered chests floating, and such aspects, whk]>at once filled him with terror and grief.Being come to the other side of the rock, hefinds at the bottom of it a narrow lake, which5separated it from the laqd, therefore pulling oflhis clothes, the Water being but shallow, hewades qver with them in his arms; and dressinghimself, walks up a considerable way in the islandwithout seeing any human creature, or perceivingany sign of its being inhabited, which struck agr§at damp on his spirits. He walks it over andover, cross ways and long ways, yet could seen thing but monkeys, strange beasts, birds, andfowls, such as he had never seen before. ■Having ranged himself weary, he sat down un¬der a cluster of trees, that made an agreeable ar¬bour, the place being pleasant and cool, made, asit were, for repose, and he being still very much,fatigued, prompted him to lie down and sleep;during which, his miijd is continually alarmedwith the frightful aspect of grim death.Having .gratefully returned thanks to heavenfor his late deliverance, he commits himself toits care, then settles and falls to sleep, and slepttill hunger awaked him to the morning,having dreamed over-night of abundance ofvictuals, which he fain would have come at, butwas hept off by a cross cook, who. bid him goand fish for some; to which he answered, that hewas shipwrecked, and had nothing to fish withal.Weil, then, said the cook to him again, go wherethou wast like to lose thy life, and there thoiashall find where withal to support it.Being' awaked, he makes reflections up¬on his dream, which, though he imagined itmight proceed from the emptiness of his stomach,being customary for people to dream of victualswhen they go to bed hungry; yet at that time6it may prove ominous; so driven by necessity,and led by curiosity, he Went, to the same side ofthe rock he had been cast upon, where havin-jstood several hours without seeing shipping, oraught that might answer his dream, the air com¬ing from the sea being pretty sharp, and he faint,having taken no manner of food for near three days,he gave over all hopes of relief. Thus submit¬ting himself to the will of heaven, which he sup¬posed decreed a lingering death to punish himfor his past sins, he resolves to return where helay the night before, and there wait for hisdoom; but being stopped by a sudden noise whichissued from a creek in the rock, not far fromwhere' he stood, he had the Curiosity to go andsee what occasioned it.Being come to the place he heard the noiseproceed from, he sees a fine large cod-fish, nearsix feet long; dabbling in a hole in the rock,where the late storm'had cast it.One under condemnation of death, and justarrived at the place of execution, could not bemore rejoiced at the coming of a reprieve, thanhe was at the sight of the fish, having felt sever¬al sick qualms, forerunners of the death hethought he was doomed to. Heaven be praised!said he, here is my dream right; where Provi¬dence rescued rriy life from the grim jaws ofdeath, there it has provided me wherewithal tosupport it.So having taken off both his garters, he getsinto the hole where the fish lay; and having runthem through his gills, he hauls it out, and dragsit after him, it being heavy, and he very weak.Going along, he finds several oysters, muscles.and cockles, in his way, which the sea had castuj$ and down the rock; and having a knife abouthim, he sat down and eat a few; so reffsshedhirhself, his spirits being exhausted for want offood. This small nutriment verv much recruit-Jed his decayed strength, and the thoughts of hissupply of provisions having dispersed the dud' ideas his late want had bred in his mind, he cheer¬fully takes, his fish, which he drags with muchmore vigour than before; and filling his pocket*with salt that was congealed by the sun, whichhe found in the cavities of the rock, away he goesto the place where he lay the night before, in or¬der to dress some of his cod-fish; where, b£ingcome, he picks up a parcel of dry k- ves, and withhis knife and flint struck fire, and kindled them:} then, gening together .a few sticks, made a firepresently, and bl ofied * slice of his fish; which heeat so heartily that it overc .me his stomach, be-• mg grown weak with .fasting: thus sick and out oforder, he applies to a helpless resource, whichwas lying down, and being much'fatigued andharassed in hauling the heavy fish up and dowrfthe rock, he fell asleep till the next morning, du-i ring which time his rest was very much disturb¬ed with the frightful dream of being attacked bya terrible monster, such as never was heard of,either for bigness or grimness, from which hewas relieved by the interference of an old Lady.Having slept quietly the remainder of the night,he awoke in the morning pretty fresh a^i,d hearty,but very much disturbed at his late dream, which^ he feared presaged, and prognosticated some ap-pcoaclting evil; but as he could make no compa¬rative allusion of the old lady, who rescued himfrom the monster, he concludes it must oe an in¬spiration of Providence (whom the grave old la¬dy did personate in the dream) who lately hadpreserved him from a death by all appearanceunavoidable, to keep him from despair in this bisgreat extremity, promising to be at hand uponoccasion. . ,Having made these considerations, he, on hisknees, returns kind Providence his hearty thanks,for all the mercies that had been extended tohim; begging the continuance of its assistance. ,'The wind being pretty high, fed his hopes,that each succeeding bopr would gratify his wish¬ing look with that object the preceding nightcould not bring forth: but he was disappointed.The night approaching, kept jack ail probabilityfor that time; howsver^de'pondtr.g on better sue. ;cess the next day, he returns whence he came;and being hungry, makes a fire, and broils ancther slice ot his fish, then lays the rest upon the .broad green leaves, and strews salt thereon tpkeep it from spoiling, then goes to rest, and ashe lay undisturbed the night before under the -trees, and much more easy than a-top, he ven-tured again, committing himself to the care o* :Providence.But his thoughts, which all day had been dis¬turbed with the dread of those hardships ho1must probably undergo, if obliged to continuethere all winter, so ran in his mind, that they oc¬casioned ideas suitable to those he had formed the,day before. ; ^‘ These reflections bred various melancbolythoughts, which almost led him to despair. Ohisaid he, that I was but a mouse, bat, or yet ayrZyF% -t . :nieaner creature! then should I be below the cruelpersecutions of fate. But man who was createdin the noblest form, endued with reason and un¬derstanding, animated witu an immortal soul,must be aimed at as the only mark worthy its ma¬lignant darts! but why do I thus rave ,at those e-vils we are the authors of? Had man continuedin his original state of innocence, the very nameof fate or fortune would not have been known.Well, since this is the product of sin, I acceptthis black lot as justly coming to my share: and.humbly submitting to Heaven’s decree, I thankfullytake this dream as a timely warningi and in imi¬tation of thos§ creatures represented in it, I willprovide what shelter I can against bad weathercomes.Accordingly, first he begins to think of mak¬ing himself an house to preserve him from theinjuries of the weather; but having nothing tomake it of, nor any instrument but a knife, whichcould be of little ser vice to him, he resol ves to go toihtit part of the rocks where he was shipwrecked,to see if he could discover any thing among thewrack that might be serviceable to him; andtherefore takes the branch of a tree abng withhim, apd coming to the place, he strips himselfand goes into the water (the water being low, dis¬covering the tops of several sharp-pointed'rocks,)and gropes along with his staff for sure footing,wading as high as his chin, diving to the bot-£;.,in frequently, and feeling about with hishands. This he continued doing for almost, twohoitrs; but to no purpose, not daring to go cut ofhis depth: for he well knew, that he could do lit¬tle good there, because he could discover r.o part»f the ship, not so much as the nwbt or any at,\,10the riggings but fancied she iay in some deep hoi>,where if was impossible to get -at her.Thus despairing,' and fretting and teasinghimself, he calls to mind that he had a hatchetin his hand when he was cast away, and thoughtprobably it might lie in that clif: of the rock intowhich he was thrown, thirher he went, and look¬ing about, perceived something like the handleof an hatchet just above the surface of the writerat the bottom of the rock; and going down to it,took it up; which to his great joy proved to b°the very thing he wanted.Having got his tool, he dresses himself, andgoes on to the island again, intending to cut down 'some trees to make himself a hut; looking abouttherefore for the properest plants, and taking no¬tice of a sort of trees, whose branches, bendingto the ground, took root, and became pliant, hethought they might be the fittest for this purpose,and cut ^sufficient parcel of them to make hisbarrack; which was full business for him that dayHis barrack being finished, which took him upfifteen days hard work; now, said he, here is ahouse, but where is the furniture ? This, indeed,may keep the weather from me, but not the cold.The ground on which I do and must lie is hard,and doubtless in the winter will grew damp,which, with want of covering, may occasion aguessnd fevers, the cholic and the rheumatism, andtwenty racking distempers, which may cause meto repent my having escaped a milder death,In this great consternation and perplexity, hegoes to see if he could spy any'shipping rulingwithin right of the island: as fie was walking a-long, full of heavy and dull thoughts, whichweighed his looks to the ground, he happened to11find a sort of high grass that grows but here andthere, round some particular sort of trees, whichhe never took notice of before. Heaven bepraised I said he, I have found wherewithal tokeep my poor body from the ground, whilst I am,by Providence, doomed to remain here: so passeson, intending at his return to cut down a suffi¬cient quantity of it to make mats, that might servehim instead of bed and bed-clothes.Having looked himself almost blind, withoutseeing the least prospect of what he desired, heconcludes upon going to cut the grass, which hestood in such want of, and spread it to dry,whilst the weather was yet warm. That piece ofwork kept him employed the remainder of theday, and the best part of the succeeding, havirignothing but a pocket knife to cut withal. Thatwork being done, wanting a tool to spread andturn his grass, he takes a branch of the next tree,which having stript off all the small ones about it,all but part of that at the top, being forky, madea tolerable fork: thus being equipped for hay-ma¬king, he went on with his work, and as he wasat it, he saw, at some distance, several monkeysas busy as himself, scratching something out ofthe ground, which they did eat upon the spot,and carried the rest to their home.His hopes that these roots might be for his use,those creatures being naturally dainty, eating no¬thing but. what men may, made him hasten tothe place be saw them scratching at, that by theherb they bear (which they tore off) he mightfind out the root.Having, by the leaves which he picked off theground, found some of the same, he digs themup, and carried them to his barrack, where he12broiled a slice of his fish, and in the ashes roastedthem, which eat something like chesnuts done inthe same manner.This new found out eatable much rejoicinghim, he returned his hearty thanks to kind Pro¬vidence, that he had put him in a way to pro¬vide himself with bread, and that of a most deli¬cious kind. As soon, therefore, as he had dined,he went out on purpose to dig a good quantity;but as he was going to the place where he hadtaken notice they grew pretty thick, he sees atortoise, of about a foot over, crawling beforehim: heaven be praised! said he, here is what willsupply me both with victuals, and utensils todress it in; he ran, therefore, and turned it on itsback, to keep it from getting away, whilst hewent to feich his hatchet, that he might cut thebottom shell from r he top, in order to make a ket¬tle of the deepest, and a dish of the. Hat part.Being tired of cod-fish, he druses the tortoise,an animal seldom eaten but upon extremity, theflesh thereof often giving the flux; neverthelesshe ventured upon it, and liked it extremely,some part of it eating very much like veal; whichat that time was a very great novelty to him, ha¬ving eaten rto fresh for a long time before.Happening to eat of the part of the tortoisewhich is the most nourishing, and less hurtful, hewas in no wise discomposed; but, having boiled itall, be laid by the remainder to eat how and thenbetween his fish.Being provided with a boiling utensil, he oftentad a change, by means of those admirable rootsso luckily discovered; some of which he roasted forbread, others he boiled with salt cod: this in a greatmeasure mitigated his misfortune, and softened13:the harJships he lay under, so that seeing but lit¬tle prospect of changing his present condition, bygetting away from thence for a while, he thinkson means to make it as easy as possible, whilst heremained in it; for having projected a bed, andtaking the grass, which by that time was dry, hefalls to work; and a mat being the thing conclu¬ded upon, he twists hie hay into ropes, the big¬ness of his leg; then he cuts a pretty number ofsticks, about two feet long, which he drives inthe ground, ten in a row, and near four inches a-sunder, and opposite to them such another rowat six or seven feet distance from the first, whichmade the length of his mat; then having fastenedone end of his rope to one of his corner sticks,he brings it round the other corner stick, and soto the next at the other end, till he has laid hisframe, thefl he weaves across shorter ropes of thesame, in the manner they make pallions on boardwith old cable ends.* When he had finished hismat, he beat it with a long stick, which made itswell up; and the gras# being of a soft cottonynature, he had a warm and easy bed to lie on.The comfort and pleasure he round on hissoft mat (being grown sore with lying on thegrotind for the space of a .month and more) soliberally gratified him for the time and labour hehad bestowed in making it, that it gave him en¬couragement to go about another; a covering be¬ing the next necessary wanted, for though thewinter was as yet pretty warm, and he in a greatmeasure, seasoned by the hardships he had gonethrough; yet the winter approaching, and the pre¬sent season still favourable for him to make pro¬vision against it, he goes and cuts more grass;which being made yeady for use, he lengthens his14loam, to allow for rolling up at one end, insteadof*a bolster, and makes it thicker thaaMhe.first;which he intends in cold weather shall lie uponhim instead of blankets.Being provided with the most necessary furni¬ture he wanted, he thinks on more conveniences,resolving to make himself a table to eat his vic¬tuals upon, and a chair to sit on: thus having cutseveral sticks above four feet long, he drives themin a r*w a little way in the ground; then takessmaller, which he interweaves between: havingmade the top, he sets it upon four other sticks,forky at the upper end, which he stuck in theground at one side of his barrack, to the heightof a table; this being done, he cuts four morebranches, such as he judged would do best for theseat and back of a chair, which he also drove inthe ground near his table; and having twisted thebranches, which grew to them, with each other,from back to front, and across again, he weavessmaller between, bottoming his seat, which com¬pletes the furniture of his habitation.Now being'entirely reconciled to the state of Ilife Providence, on whom he fully depended, hadbeen pleased to call him to, he resolves to makeprovision of these excellent roots; atid with hishatchet he cuts a piece of a tree wherewith hemakes a shovel, in order to dig them up with.more ease: with this instrument he went to theplace where he had observed they grew thickest,which being near the monkeys quarters, .theycape down from off the trees in great numbers,grinning as if they would have flown at himjwhicn made him stop a whffe; he might, indeed,with the instrument in his hand, have killed se¬veral, asd perhaps have dispersed the rest, but15 •would not: why, said he, should I add barbarityto injustice; it is but natural and reasonable forevery creature to guard and defend their own;this was given them by nature for food, which Icome to rob them of; and since I am obliged toget of them for my subsistence, if I am decreedto be here another season, I will set some in aplace distant from theirs for my own use.Having stood a considerable time, those animalsseeing he did not go forwards, each went andscratched up for itself, and afterwards retiring,giving him the opportunity to dig up a few forhimself: and as he was not come to the 'placewhere they grew thick, he laid them in smallheaps as he dug them up; while those sly crea¬tures would, whilst he was digging up more, comedown from the trees, where they stood hid a-mong the leaves, and steal them- away, which o-bliged him to be contented for that time with asmany as his pockets would hold, resolving to bringsomething next time which would contain a largerquantity; and fearing those animals, which arenaturally very cunning, should dig them up, hecomes early in the morning following to makehis provision: and for want of a sack to put themin, he takes his jacket, which he buttons up, andties at the sleeves, and as he had observed that e-very root had abundance of little ofF-sets hangingat it by small fibres, he pulled off his shirt also,of which he makes another sack to put them in.Having concluded upon catching some animalswhich he had seen in the woods, h$ considers bywh"t means, having no dogs to hunt, nor'gunstoshoot: having paused a while, he resolves uponmaking gins, wherewith he had seen hares catch-ed in Europe; thus, taking some of the cords16 '  which he found with a sail at the outside o*rock, he goes to work, and makes several, whichhe fastens at divers gaps in the thicket within thewood, through which he judged that sort of beasthe had a mind for went.Impatient to know the success of his snares, hegets up betimes the next morning, and goes toexamine them; in one of which he found a cer-ttain animal something like a fawn, the colour ofa deer, but feet and ears like a fox, and as big asa well-grown hare; he was much rejoiced at hisgame, whose mouth he immediately opened to seaif he could find whether it fed upon grass, or liv¬ed upon prey; the creature being caught by theneck, and strangled with struggling, before it diedhad brought up in its throat some of the greens ithad been eating, which Very much pleased him,accounting those fahich lived upon flesh as bad ascarrion.Having returned thanks for his good luck, hetakes it home, in order to dress part of it for hi?dinner; so cases and guts it. And having stuck along stick at both ends iA the ground, making ahalf circle, he bangs one quarter of the animalupon a string before a good fire, and so roasts it.His dinner being ready, having said grace, heset to eating with an uncommon appetite; andwhether it was the novelty of the dish, or that themeat did really deserve the praise, he reallythought he never eat any kind of flesh, till then,comparable to it either for taste or tenderness.Having made a couple of nets, about four feetsquare, which he fastens in the room of the kill¬ing snares, so retired, and resolved to come andexamine them every morning.Several days paved without taking any thing,17so that he wanted flesh for a whole week; whichdid begin to disorder his stomach, but not his tem¬per: being entirely resigned to the will of provi¬dence, and fully contented with whatever heavenwas pleased to send.One afternoon, which was not his customarytime of day to examine his nets, being too visiblein tbe day-time for game to run in, he happenedto walk in the wood, to take full dimensionsthereof, so chanced to go by his nets; in one ofwhich were taken two animals as big as a kid sixweeks old, of a bright dun, their horns uprightand straight, the shape like a stag, and most cu¬riously limbed, a small tuft of hair on feach shoul¬der and hip. By their horns, which were butshort, they appeared to be very young, which re¬joiced him the more, being in hopes to tame thosehe did not want for present use; so carried themhome, joyful of his game, depending uporl a gooddinner but was sadly disappointed: the animals hefound were antelopes, (calling to mind he hadseen them in his travels), which proved both fe¬males, he had made a resolution to preserve.Though they were too young to be with kid, andhe in great need of flesh, yet he would npt killthem; therefore, with cords, fastens them to theoutside of his lodge;, and with constant feedingthem, in two months time made them so tame,that they followed him up and down; which addedmuch to the pleasure he already took in his ha¬bitation, which by that time was covered withgreen leaves, both top and sides, the stakes it wasmade of having struck root, and shot out youngbranches, whose strength increasing that summer;' to fill up the vacancy between each plant, he pull¬ed ud the truss wherewith he had covered the's 18ouxside and top of the hut between the*), to keepthe cold out in the winter.Having completed that piece of work, he goesand visits his plantations, which he finds in athriving condition, the roots being, in six monthstime, grown from the bigness of a pea (as theywere when first set) tc that of an egg: his ante- ■lopes also were come to their full growth andcomplete beauty, which exceeded most fourfootedbeasts, having a majestic presence, body and limbsrepresenting a stag, and the noble march of ahorse; so every thing concurred to his happiness.For which, having returned his most liberal bene¬factor his grateful acknowledgments, he thinks onmeans to prevent any obstructions that-'may inter¬cept the continuation thereofj and as the want ofclothes was the only cause he could think of tomake him uneasy, havuigbut the jacket and clotheswhich -were given him on board; to save his ownclothes which, when worn out, hecould not recruit,therefore, to accustom himself to go without, hethinks on those he had, so takes away the liningfrom the outside of his clothing, in order to wearthe thickest in the coldest weather, and so thinshis dress by degrees, till at last he went quitenaked.Having thus concluded, as being the best shiftnecessity could raise him, he falls a ripping hisjacket, in the lining whereof lie finds seven peas,and three beans, which were got in at a hole inthe corner of the pocket.Those few made him wish for more, which yethe had no room to hope for, they being raised bysaed which the island did not produce; these few,sEid he, which at present are hardly suilicient tosatisfy a womans longing, may, with time and in-: 19Justi y, be improved to a quantity large enough toicrve me for a meal, then lays them up againsti proper time to set them, so spent the remainderof that summer in walking about the island, wa¬tering his lodge, weeding his root plantation, at¬tending his nets, whith now and then suppliedhim with an antelope or goat, to eat at internalsoetweenj fish he commonly found on the rock af¬ter high winds and storms: never failing to visitthe sea three or four times a-week, according as:he weather did prove: thus diverting many an¬xious hours with variety of objects that elementaffords. Sometimes he had the pleasure to seejreat whales chasing one another, spouting largestreams of water out Of their gills and nostrils: atather times, numbers of beautiful dolphins rol-ing amongst the waves: now and then a quaniityif strange monstrous fish playing on the sur¬face of the sea, some whereof had heads (uot:ommon to fishes) like- those of hogs, othersnot unlike those of dogs, calves, horses, lions',.auUs, goats, and several other creatures; somethasing another sort, which to avoid being taken,would quit their element, and seek refuge inthe air, and fly some yards above the watermilltheir fins, being dry, obliged them to plunge inagain.In this prosperous way he lived fifteen years^finding no alteration in the weather or seasons,nor meeting in all the time with any. transactionsworthy of record: still performing his usual exer¬cises, and taking his walk with all the content andsatisfaction his happy condition could procure,entirely forsaking all thoughts and desires of ever -quitting the blessed station he then had in. his pos*session.. ' ■4One day, after a violent storm, being at thatside of the rock he used to visit, as he was look- |ing about, he hears a voice cry out, like that ofa man from behind the rock: this set his a*,glowing, and he said to himself, I shall now have*a companion; and, proceeds the spot, and sawsomething which he took to be a chest; with hisstaff he broke it open, and as he was striking it,a boy underneath called to him in French to turnit up; at this he put the end of his staff, and rais¬ed it up about a foot from the ground, and out ofthe opening immediately out creeps the boy, whofalling upon his knees, and holding up his hands,almost drowned in tears, and begging for mercyin such a moving manner, that Quarle could notrefrain from shedding tears! and taking him bythe hand, he led him to his habitation, wherethey lived in a state of comparative happiness forthe space of ten years: till one morning, the boyhaving gone out to catch some oysters, he observeda ship at a distance; at which his heart fell a-pant-ing, his pulse doubled its motion, his blood growswarmer and warmer, till at length, inflamed withthe desire of getting at it, he lays down the baghe had brought to carry the oysters in, and fallsto swimming: the men on board having espiedhim, sent out their boat which picked him up.Thus he went away without taking leave of himhe had received so much good from. ,One morning he was awakened by a greatnoise of squeeling: and his mind being impressedwith notions of war, it at first seized him withterror: but being somewhat settled, and the noisestill continuing, he perceived it proceeded fromthe two different kinds of monkeys in the island,vvhch were fighting for the wild pomegranatesft*m■that the high wind had shook off the trees thepreceding night.Having guessed the occasion of their debate,he gets up in order to go and quell their differ¬ence, by dividing amongst them the cause, thereof.Getting up, he opens the door, at the outside ofwhich an old monkey of each sort were quietlywaiting his levee, to entice him to come, as he oncebefore did, and put an end to their bloody war.He was not a little surprised to see two invete¬rate enemies, who at other times never meet with¬out fighting, at that juncture agree so well. \One morning, when be had roasted a parcel ofroots, which he used to eat instead of bread, andthis he commonly did once a week, it eating best.when stale; having spread them on his table andchest to cool, he went out to walk, leaving hisdoor open to let the air in. /His jralk, though graced with all the agreeablesnature could adotn it with, to make it delightful,a grass carpet, embroidered'with beautiful flpwersof many different colours and smells, under bisfeet, to tread;

by heaven’s intent.At once their guard and ornament.So, on fome meadow’s banky fide,'Where Flora reigns in artlefs pride.The fame rich beam that fliews the bloom,-Creates the colour and perfume.Soon as fair friendfliip’s holy fpellHas taught the little heart to fwell.To ev’ry feature ’twill fupplyA correfponding harmony,Call the whole countenance anew,Tho’ foft’ning, yet ennobling too.But chief Devotion’s hallow’d dutiesMuft crown and beautify their beauties 5Hence, redolent of joy ferene,Divine love’s elevated mien;Hence peace and genuine honour fpreadTheir blended glories round the head ;Hence the meek eye with hope replete,Yet beaming with a feraph’s heat;Th’ Elyfian glow and every graceThron’d in the true Madona face.So, poets feign, frometleus ftoleFrom heaven his animating coal.Parent! ere yet their features fix,Or folly with the heart can mix.For in a tainted veflel pour’d.The generous infufions’s four’d—Be thefe thy arts ; their fouls refine.And all the Calipeedia’s * thine ;For Virtue’s felf (fo Plato thought)To vifible exiftence brought,—This, this is Beauty—mull be fo,Or beauty’s but a name below.A fuiting body it creates,Pervades, illumes, affimilates.Thus the warm virgin-wax receivesTh’ impreffion that the fignet gives ;Now a chafte Veftal feems, and nowThe Goddefs of the painted bow ;Now bears aloft the plumy creft,And all Minerva Hands confefs’d;* A Latin poem Jo called, teaching the art of baviogbeautiful children.( 7 )| Now the majeftic wife of Jove,I And now the Queen of Grace and Love;Her fairy Cupids hovering round,With tiny fliafts prepar’d to wound.Sportive o’er all her perfon ftraying,Now on her cheek or bofom playing.Now in her beamy eyes they meet,Ambrofial hands or filver feet.’Twas at a mifer’s cold abode,Two cryftal urns furvey’d the road ;This fhone (while that was void and damp JConfeious of oil and fire—a lamp.For fliew he plac’d them, nothing loth.But ah ! th’ expence to.light them both.He faw by calculation clear.At this per day, was that per year.The beamlefs vafe, when night prevail’d.Her unimportance thus bewail’d ;“ Too partial Fate ! why doom to me“ This odious, dull obfcurity ?“ Here many a tedious night I’ve hung,« Nor blefs’d by old, nor prais’d by young j“ To mefcarce one kind glance is given,« While like the moon, that lamp of heav'n,“ My filler of congenial glafs,“ Wins all the hearts of all that pafs.u Suppofe her ftation they revere,“ I boaft the fame exalted fphere;“ Do they with awe her crown behold,« Her drefs of blue, diftindt with gold ?“ Thefc gave her not fuperior fame,*< Her ornaments and mine the fame.( 8 )’Tis not her eafy ftiape and air,“ Her fwelling bofom heavenly clear,** Her fmoother polilh, brighter hue ;« No ; for in thefe we’re hardly two.** Yet while Ihe fits triumphant by,“ The Cynofure * of every eye, • North fair.“ I’m feen, if feen, with fcorn alone,“ May fall unmifs’d, or Hand unknown.“ Speak, dotards, fpeak, the diff’rencc Clew,“ Or own caprice rules all below.”‘ Sifter, forbear,’ the other cried,4 To tell the world you’re mortifi’d.4 Envy no votaries fliall gain,4 It fcarce has pity for its pain.4 ’Tis not indeed my fairer frame,4 No native excellence I claim ;4 ’Tis not my body’s happier mold,4 More polilh’d, pure, or rich with gold ;4 In thefe one character’s our due,4 You fair as I, I frail as you :4 And yet while you neglected fit,4 Or but the theme of taunting wit,4 I fix the traveller’s ardent gaze,4 Have all his blefling all his praife.4 What can this different treatment win :4 Sure, fifter, ’tis the lght within.’

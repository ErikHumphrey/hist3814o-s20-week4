Thefe Orators, Gentlemen,have a handfome annual (alary, and do not in the lea ftdepend on the affluence or bounty of their audience,conlequentlv may be le(s careful to entertain them pro¬perly. But the caie is quite reverie with Ciaudero, whohas his Pole dependance on the benevolence of ipdividu-als; Therefore it may reafonabiy be expedied, he willexert ei ery faculty of his foul, in order to acquit him-felf to the univerlal fatisfacfion of thofe Gentlemen, vrhffdo him the honour to attend his Orations,"This being my firft appearance in the charatfer of an©rater, 1 would not, nay I durft not trull my memorywith what 1 am about to deliver, elpecially when I con-fidered myfelf in the prelence of luch a polite aud learnedaudience, capable of obl'erving the minuted error eitherin Etymology or Syntax: and as it is the invariable prac¬tice of many of my learned brethren, Orators of. a longHanding, to deliver, their dilcourfes from a dudied mu-nufeript, even though the bulk of their audience arecompoled of the lowed and mod illiterate clals, fuchas Coblers, Kail-wives, Cinder-wenches, &c.

To be brief then*I do not intend in the prolecution of my fubjeifls, toquote other Orators purely with an.intention of brow¬ing diit in their faces, as is to often the pra6tice of ma¬ny of my learned brethr-en, who thereby endeavour toinlinuate to their pupils, that their own capacities arelb far lupeiior to all that ever Ipoke or wrote beforethem, that they bid fair to dand on the records of famefine qua uon ; And as it were bid defiance to future agesto treat them in the lame leurvy manner —This methodof ilepretiating others is by the moderns called obliquepuffing. The direct pull’again is, where Orators recom¬end and damp a vame upon themfelves in. a more bluntand immediate way ; for a Ipecimen of both, read the.pulfi and inaugural puffs of Dr Smouie the duelill, whodelerves to be llrutk out of the lilt of Orators for hisbloody dilpolition, apd late invidious publications.

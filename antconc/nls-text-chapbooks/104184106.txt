Sir,And to suspect her acting wrong,Was certainly a sin, Sir.When all was quiet the young ones then,Forgot their former fears, sir.Began to talk, at length their voice.Did reach the old wife’s ears, sir.who told her husband, honest man,And firmly did avow, sir.She was convinc’d that one or more,was with their daughter now, sir.Then hastily she started up,And op’d the chamber door, sir,More quietly then her husband did,when he went there before, sir.And as she gropped round the room,And for the bed did feel, sir.She miss’d a foot, and, by bad luck.She tumble! in the creel, sir.But here the struggle that she made,Did agitate the rope, sir,which was the signal for the men,who hoys’d her to the top, sir.But then her recolection lied,She sunk into a faint, sir,And where she was or how she went;T’was more than e’er she kent, sir.The men soon found they had not got.The one they did intend, sir.So drop’d their tackle once again.And soon brought up their friend, sir.They left the old wife on the roof.Still thinking she was dead, sir,They stretch’d her gently on the top.Gloss by the chimney head, sir.when she awaked from her tranceAnd upward cast her eyes, sir,And nothing saw but moon and stars.All glancing in the skies, sir.She gave a most alarming cry.Then she began to pray, sir,And grasped hard the mossy turf,where-on she stretched lay, sir.The old man started from his bed.And so did Nell their daughter, sir.And eagerly, with anxious hearts,Most earnestly they sought her, sir.They search’d the house both but and ben,And round about the biggin’, sir,At length they found her on the roof,And grasping at the riggin’, sir.8But how that she came to that place,She never yet could tell, sir,But said she thought the muckle deil,was dragging her to hell, sir.The old man swore a Judgment sure.Had brought her to that place, sir,T’hus to disturb their daughter dear,while at a throne of grace, sir.An alteration soon appear'dUpon their daughter Nell, sir.The colour fled her rosy cheeks,.•Ind she began to swell, sir.^4nd Jock for ever after that,was welcome aye to come, sir,^Ind freely enter by the door,.And nae mair by the lum, sir.

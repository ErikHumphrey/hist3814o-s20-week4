Leper being the youngest, w isgreatly idolized by his mother, who wasi good soft-natured woman, very indus-rious, and followed the business of□leaching cloth.As Leper grew up, he turned a veryrmischievons boy playing many tricks onl.he neighbourhood, such as tying cat* tologs tads, brecken hen’s legs, stoppingums or chimney-tops j that his poor mc-her was sadly vexed with complaints a-gainst him.I vTo get him kept from mischief, siprevailed with a taylor to take him aapprentice, he settled and was peaceabfor some time, until he got so muchhis trade on his finger ends as he migpass for a journeyman, and then he .vijindifferent whether he stayed with 1master or not; his mistress gave him bvery little meat when he wrought at hornso he liked best to he in other house#iwhere he got meat and diversion.Leper being resolved on revengegainst his mistress tor thin kail, no ki fchen, and little bread; for though flei rwas boiled in the pot, none for poor Lper and his master, but a little bit on Su oday’s, and all the bones were kept ai tput in the pot, to make the broth throng othe week. Leper perceived always win I®she took off the pot, she turned her bai faand took out the flesh, and sets it in itshelf in her own bedroom ; one night; I ;ter work, he steals out a pan, cuts a pieof flesh out of a dead horse, and then go'to a lime kiln and boils it; JieJtt day hmaster being from him, his landlady a* ahim being in the house, after she had soff the pot as usual, and taken outbit of good beef, he goes out for son0(y r( 5 )ne, and then comes in, saying the mill¬iter's lass is wishing to see you, to goirectly and speak to her mistress Offlie goes in all haste, Leper runs and takesway her bits of good meat, and laysiown his horse flesh, and knowing shei rofild return in a passion, and sit downiWth a loss in her cushioned chair, as shesed, he takes a large pin, and staps itjtraight through the cushion, with itsjiead on the chair and the point to her♦ackside. So in she comes in a rage, andiiiown she sits with all her weight on thelain point, and then roars out murder,.(Jnurder, for she was sticked in the a—e;die neighbours came running in, and be-ler went out with his bit of good beef,eaving the wives to docter his landlady'sdoup as they pleased $ he stilt denied thedoing of it, and his master believed itmight happen accidentally, but the hou-i die vas very oft to be had before it wasiigot hale again ; and his landlady by eat-iing of th^,t horse beef, took such a loath¬ing at flesh that Leper and his master gotall the beef ever after, and his landlady,turned one of the kindest mistresses aprentice could wish for.There was a neighbour wife on whom- ’ ■ ( 6 )teper used to play tricks sometin.es,which she came and complained tomaster and had him severely beatenveral times j Leper resolved to be reveted on her T so one night he caoue to t|backside of the house (no one beingbut herself) and took up a big stone, airuns along the rough vitii with ail 1strengtli, which roared like thunderthe inside, of the house, and frightned twife so, that she thought that the houwas tumbling down about her ears, atshe ran out and sat down at a distanclooking every minute when the hon.iwould fall down, till her husband camhome and persuaded her to go in, twhom she told ilte above story, “ hotitout daft tapie,” said he, “ the house wistand these hundred yeai'p.5’ Leper knowing they were both m, comes and play:!the same trick over, again, which atscfrighted the good man so much, that hcried out—“ run Maggy,, run, for my!heart plays pittv patty.” And theywould not lodge in the house atiy mortill the mason convinced them °f its]sufficiency. ' LThere was another neighbour who hada snarling cur dog, which bit Leper’s leg -t(ipcr resolved to be revenged on tbejtg, and so one night he catches the dogId carries him to the kirk where thepe of the bell hung on the outside, soSth his garter he tied the dog’s fore-ot to the rope and left him hanging;*e dog struggling to get free set the bellringing, which alarmed the whole vill-;ge, every one cried out, ‘ wonderful sirs 1onderful sirs ! the devil is ringing theell!” When they saw the black colleyanging at the rope, I true it set theainister and all the people to their pray-rs : but Leper fearing he would be de¬fected by his garter, came to the mini-;ter’s side and asked the reverend gentle-nan what was the matter; indeed myaairn, said he, ’tis the deil ringing thekirk bell; says Leper, I’ll go and see him,for l never saw the devil; the minister.■cried, stop the mad laddie, but Leperran and loosed the dog, crying, its sucha man’s dog, which had the rope in histeeth ; they all cried out, “ the deil’s i*the cur, the deil’s i’ the dogthen took1 up stones and felled poor colley, and thei devil got the blame of making the dogring the bell; this spread Leper's fame,; for being one of the wildest and mot cor-( 8 >rageous taylors that was in all thedoin j and man}- shaking their he|said, “ it was a pity he was a taylor,a captain or general of an array, asdevil could not ffar him.’*After this a farmer in the neigh behood hearing the fame of Leper, ho^had frighted the de’il frae being a bjman, sent for him to an ale-house,drank with him very heartly, and thim, he was sadly borne down byspirit of jealoucy against his wife ; ansuspicion of her being too free witlservant lad he had before, and if he woi;keep it secret, and learn him to find Iout, he would give his mother a loadmeal, to which Leper agreed, he gave tpoor supposed cuckold instructions hto behave. So home he goes, and feighimself very sick, and every day wort!and worse, taking death to him, blesshis three small children, and charges hwife not to marry until his children couldo something for themselves. This hypocritical woman takes a crying, Ahamarry she could never marry! no, nthere should never a man lye by my sideor kiss my lips after thee, my ain clearlamb Johnny.—Then he acts the dead( y )han as well as he possibly could, therijl eighbours were called in, and he’s fairlwI’e/seen, as the old saying is, before goodNeighbours. The sorrowful widow madej sad lament, wrung her hands, tore herfair.—The reverend woman about begam10 dress the corpse, asked her for a shirt,Ay, ay, said she, he has twa new linenlarks, and there is an auld ane in thebottom o’ the kist ihai naebody can wear,j'|ny thing good enough for the grave;jrikell said they we must have some linenjPor a winding sheet, a-well co’ she, I haei vva" cut o’ linen i’ the kist neuk, but!'here’s a pair o’ auld linen sheets hol’d’ the middle, may do well enough, I haereed to be carefu’ I am a poor widow:he day wi’ three sma’ bairns.Well the corspe is dressed, and laid oni he top of the big chest while neighboursi^at by her, condoling her misfortune, andhow the funeral raisens were to be pro-bided: said one, the coffin must needsae seen about first; Ay, ay, he had somelew deals in the barn, he bought them:o make a bed o’, but we’ll no break:hem, there’s the auld barn door, andthe caff kist will do well enough, onything’s gude enough to gang to the grave */( 10 )vvi’; but, O, co’ she, send for Sandy, my |honest auld servant, and he’ll see everything right done ; I’ll tell him where hewill get siller to do any thing wi*, he’s Ithe lad that will no see me wrang’dthen Sandy comes wrying his face, and |his eyes. O Sandy, there’s a sad altera¬tion here, and ba-a-a, she cries like abit-|ten calf, O sirs, will ye gang a but thelhouse till 1 tell him what to do ; but they |goes, and there she fell a kissing of San-|dy, and said, now my dear, the auld chat-1taring ghaist is awa, and we will get our jiwill o* ither; be as haining of every thing |as ye can, for thou kens its a your ain ;but the corpse sister and some other peo¬ple coming inj ben they came to see thecorpse, lift up die cloth off his face, andseeing him all in a*pour of sweet, saidheigh, he’s a bonny eorp, and a livelylike colour ; when he could no longercontain himself to carry on the joke, but |up he got among them, a deal of people- |ran for it, and his wife cried out, O my fdear do you ken me? Ay, you base jade *!and whore, better than ever I did. |Jumps on the floor, gets Jus tafb and 1runs after Sandy and catches him in the |fields, a little from the house ate and(11 ),drark witli his sister and neighbours,■wiio had come to see his corpse: andpoor Sandy went home with a skinful of|'terror, and a sorting of sore bones, took| a sore fever, and died in a few days after,I so he got quite of his cukolder, and Le-| per’s mother got her load of meal.Leper’s mother was a careful industri-1 ous wife, but as the bye word is, “ a work*i ing mother makes a dally daughter,” andso it happened here, for she had two idleI gleaket sluts of daughter's, that w ould donothing but lye in their beds in the mor¬al ning, till, as thmsaying is, ‘fthe sun was! like to burn a hole in their backsides.”1 The old woman, who was bleaching somei cloth was very early at w'ork in the morn¬ings and Leper’s patience being womcuti| with the laziness of his sisters, he resolv*i ed to play a trick on them, for their re-| formation ; so he goes and gets a mort-•| cloth, and spreads it on the bed above| them, and sends the dead bell through\ the town, inviting the people next dayat four o’clock afternoon, to the burialof his sisters, for they had died suddenly :this brought all the neighbour wives in,who one after another lifted up the mort-cloth, and said with a sigh, they’ve gone( yto their rest a sudden call imleed! Theiraunt hearing of this sudden news, camerunning in all haste, and coming wherethe jades mither was at work, and wasignorant of the stoiyj she cries out, Fyupon ye, woman, fy upon ye! What’sthe matter, sister, says she, what's thematter! I think you might let your workstand for ae day, when your daughtersare baith lying corpse. My bairns corpse !I am certain they went to bed hale andfair last night. But I tell you, says theother, the dead bell has been throughwarning the folks to the burial; then the Imother cries out, O the villain, O the Ivillain ! that he did not send the word. |So they both ran, and the mother as soon Ias she entered the house, dies to the bed,crying O my bairns, my dear bairns ! onwhich the sluts rose up a consternation,to the great surprise of the beholders, *:and the great mortification of the girls, |who thought shame to set their noses out iof doors, and to the great diverson of thewhole town.Leper and his master went to a gentle- iman's house to work, where there was asaucy housekeeper, who had more ignor-arfre and pride than good sense a«d’< 13 )manners; she domineered over her fel¬low servants in a tyrannical manner: Le¬per resolved to mortify her pride ; so hefinds an ant’s nest, and takes their whiteeggs, grinds them to a powder, and putsthem into the dish her supper sowns wasto be put in. After she had taken hersupper, as she was covering the table,the imnoke powder began to operate, andshe let a great fart, well done Margaret,says the Laird, your arse would take acautioner *, before she got out at thechamber door she lets fiy another crack ;then she goes to order her fellow servantto give the Laird his supper, but beforeshe could give the necessary directions,she gave fire again, which set them ail alaughing; she runs into a room herself,and there she played away htr own gunbattery so fast, that you would havethought she had been besieging the Ha-vannah. The Laird and bis Lady cameto hear the fun, they were like to splittheir sides at proud Maggy. So nextmorning she left her place to thegreat satisfaction ofall her fellow-servants.( )PART ItLEPER'S landlady.became very harshto his master, and very often abused himexceedingly sore with her tongue andhand, and always called upon him..•formore money, and to have all the moneyin her keeping, which Leper wras sorryfor. It so happened on a day that thetaylor had got a hearty drubbing with' tongue and tongs, that he pouchedhis thimble and was going to make aQueen of her ; when she saw that, shecried out, O! will you leave-a poor, ten¬der, dying woman. But Leper knowingthe cause of her ill nature, better thanhis master did, advised him to take her oua fine day, like a mile out of the towmand give her a walk, and he would stayat home and study a remedy for her dis-order.—Away they boih goes, but as shewas always complaining for want of healthand that she was very weak, siie criedfrequently out, O! ’tis a crying sin totake a woman in my condition out o’era door. During their absence Leper goesand searches her bed, and below' the bol¬ster, he gets a bottle of rare whisky, of( u )which he takes a hearty pulf, and thenpisses in it to make it up, gets a halpenny worth of snuff and puts it in also,shakes all together, and so sets it in itsplace again.—Home they came, and shewas exceedingly distressed as a womancould he, and cried out, it was a horridthing to take her out of the house. Thetaylor seeing her so bad, thought shewould have died, ran as fast as he could| for a dram, but she iu her hypocrisy pre¬tended she could not take it, and calledon him to help her to bed, into which helays her, lie was not well gone when shefell to her bottle, taking two or threehearty gluts, then she roars out murder,I’m poisoned, I’m poisoned.—Bookingand purging began, and the neighbourswere called in, she -eaves her blood uponLeper, and tellsLow such an honest wo.man brought her ae bottle as anotherwas done, and the murdering loon had; stolen it and pu t in a bottle of poison in-; stead of it. Leper took to his heels, butwas pursued and carried before a just iceof the peace, where he told, all he haddone, which made the justice laugh hear¬tily at the joke, and the tavlor’.s wife waswell purged from her feigned sickness*, . ( 1« )laziness and cursed ill nature ; for alwayswhen she began to cud her nose for thefuture, the taylor had no more to say,but Maggy, Maggy mind the bottle.Leper was working with a master tay¬lor in Glasgow, who hungered his men,and one morbing when breakfast was seton the table, /n comes a gentleman to tryon a suit of clothes the master being ob¬liged to rise, desired the lads to say thegrace themselves ; every one refused it,and put it to his neigh bur, till Leper un¬dertook it, and said with an audible voice,that the stranger gentleman might over¬hear him as follow's: “ Och, hoch! weare a parcel of boor beastly bodies, andas beastly minded, if we do not work weget nothing to eat, yet we are alwaysfretting, singing, and half starving is liketo be our fortune, scai tings and scrapingsis the most, of our mouthfuls : we wouldfain thank thee for our fulness, if it wereso, but the rest of our benefactors arenot worthy the acknowledging; heyAmen.” The gentleman laughed till hissides were like to burst, and gave Leperhalf-a-crown to drink.Leper was not long done with his ap¬prenticeship till he set up for himself,C 17 )and got a journey man and an apprentice,was coming into very good business, andhad he restrained his roguish tricks hemight* have done very well. He and hislads being employed to work in a far.mer's house where the housewife was agreat miser, and not very cleanly in mak-ing meat, and snevled through her nosegreatly when she spoke.—In the mor¬ning when she went to make their pot¬tage, she made a fashion of washing thepot, which to appearance seemed to himto have been amongst the first that hadbeen made j then she set it before thefire till she went to the well, in whichtime Leper looking into it, sees two greatholes stapped with clouts, he takes up hisgoose, and holds it as high as his head,then lets it drop into the pot, whichknocked out the bottom out of it; pre¬sently in comes the wife with the water,and pours it into the pot which s t thefire-side all in a dam, tor still as she pour¬ed in, it ran out, the wife being .short¬sighted, or what they call sand blind,looks into the pot, holds up both herhands, and cries, “ Losh preserve me,sirs ; for the grip atween the twa holes isbroken —says Leper, the pot was old( 18 )eViou^h, but do ybu ken taylors pottageis heavier than other men’s. Indeed tadI believe it, but they say ye’re a warlock ;it’s Wednesday all the world o’er, and awaefu’ Wednesday to me indeed, my potmight ha’e lasted me this fifty year, a'-saewad it e’en.This sport diverted Leper and his ladsthro’ the day; and after supper, know¬ing he was to get some dirty bed, as thecows and the people lived all in one a«partment, he chose rather to go home ;and knowing the moon was to rise alittleafter midnight, he sat along by the fire,told them many a fine story to drive a-way the time, and bade the wife, makethe bed to see how it might be ; to savecandle, she made it in the dark, directlyon the door, behind where they sat, shak¬ing down two bottles of straw; a calf,which chanced to.be lying on that placeand which the wife did not notice, wascovered with the straw, and the bedclothes spread over us. The most of thefamily being in bed, the wife told thenito go tb bed also; but Leper knowing ofthe calf, said I’ll make my bed come tome, on which the wife began to pray forherself, and all that was in the house ; soff 10 )tip he get s his el wand, and gives a strohecn the bed, which caused the brute torise, and not seeing wliere to go, it fella crying and turned round, which set thewhole house a roaring out murder in their■own tongue. The goodwife ran to thebed above the gOodirian, and the wholefamily cried out, not knowing what itwas, but Leper and his two lads whiptoff the blankets, arid the brute ran in a-mongst the rest unperceived, then Leperlighted a candle, and all of them got outof bed, paid Leper for his work, and moreif he pleased, ‘and begged him to go awayand take the devil with him, So homehe went, but never was employed by thatwife afiv more.*l .eper had a deal of the best customersboth in town and country; so ■- oe ti'mehe had occasion to go to’the p:u ish of 1.) -chmantc make a wedding suit to a gentle¬man, after they were flaished, he askeddrink money for his lads, which the gen¬tleman refused; Leper resolved to be e-veii with him, so he goes up to the ha}*,loft where the groom slept, and takes hisstockings, breeches, and jacket, sews al¬together and 'stuffs them full of hay,makes a head, puts a rope about his neck,C 20 yand hangs it on a tree, opposite to thelaird’s window, then goes to the laird andtells him that his groom had hanged him-self, and that if he would open his win¬dow he would see him hanging; the lairdwas struck with astonishment, and knewnot what to do; Leper advises to buryhim privately. The laird said he hadnot a servant he could trust, so beggedof Leper to do it; Leper refuses till thelaird promised him a load of meal, thenLeper pulls out all the hay out of thegroom’s clothes, goes and gets his loadot yieal, and sends it to Glasgow, thengoes to the groom and says, lad, thy mas¬ter is wanting thee:—so the lad in a hasteruns to see what his master wanted, thelaird no sooner saw him open the door,than he cried out, Avoid thee -Satan, a- Ivoid thee Satan ? the lad says what’s the |matter? Did you hang yourself thrs mor- |ring ? Lord forbid ! said the lad; the laird |says, If thou be an earthly creature, take |that tankard and drink; which he did ;then says he to his master, Leper called J:me up, and said you wanted me in allhaste ; Ho, ho,’said the laird, I find outthe story no .v, if I had Leper 1 wouldrun my sword through him ; but Leper( 21 )befote tliafc was gone for Glasgow withh\s meal.Leper was in use to give his lads theirSunday’s supper which obliged him to >stay from the kirk in the afternoon, hehaving neither wife nor servant in aid.; soone Sunday afternoon as he was cookinghis pot, John Muckle Cheek and JamesPuff and Blaw, two civileers, leavingmore zeal than knowledge, came uponhim, and said, what’s the matter, sir, yougo not to the kirk ? Leper replied, J amreading my book, and cooking my potwhich 1 think is a work of necessity.Then says the one to the other don’t an¬swer that graceless fellow, we’ll makehim appear before his betters, so theytook the kail-pot, and puts a staff throughthe bools, and bears it. to the clerk’schamber: Leper, who never was at a lossfor invention, goes to the Principal of thecollege’s house, no body being at homebut the lass roasting a leg of mutton 5Leper says, my dear will you go and bringme a pint of ale, and PU turn the spittill you come back, the lass was no soon¬er gone, than he runs away with the legof mutton, which served his lads and himfor their supper. When the Principal1• jC 22 )came home he was neither to hand norbfnhe was so angry; so on Monday he goesand makes complaint to the Lord Pro¬vost, who sends two officers for Leper,who came immediately, My Lordasked him how he dared to take away thePrincipal's mutton? Leper replied, howcame your civileers to take away my kail-pot ? I’m sure there is less sin in makinga pot full of kail than roasting a leg of• mutton, law makers should not be lawbreakers, so I demand justice on the ci¬vileers : The provost asked him what.justice he would have? says he, makethem carry the pot back again; as to thePrincipal, a leg of mutton won’t makehim and me fall out; so they .were forcedto carry back the pot again, and Lepercaused the boys to huzza after them totheir disgrace.There was a harber which alwaysplagued Leper, and called him prick-tlie-louse. Leper resolved to be even withhim, so he goes and buys three sheep,heads, and sends for the barber and toldhim, that there were three fine Southlandgentlemen just come to his house, whomuch wanted to be shaved, and he as-usred him he would receive sixpence for( 23 )each one ofthem ;—this good news madethe shaver send for a dram ; Leper wasstill praising tfiem for qipet good narnredgentlemen,so Leper takes him to the bedwhere the sheep-heads lay covered, anddesired him to awaken them for theywould not be angry, or say an ili word tohim; the barber lifts the covering and seesthe sheep-heads runs out cursing andswearing, & Leper crying after him,sheep-head-barber.The barber resolved to be revnged o nLeper, so when he was shaving M ess Johnhe tells him that Leper was the drunken-est fellow in his parish ; so Mess Johnwarns him to the session ; Leper comesand says what do you want with me Sir?Come away Leper, says Mess John, I heara bad report of you; Me Sir ! I am surethey were not my friends that told youthat.—Indeed, I am informed you are adrunkard I a drunkard 1—You havenot a soberer man in your parish : StopSir, I will tell you how I lead my fife—in the morning I take a choppin of aleand a bit of bread; that I call my mor¬ning ; for breakfast I generally take aherring and a choppin of ale, for 1 can¬not sup brose like my lads $ the herring( 24 )makes me diy, and at eleven hours I takea pint and sometimes three choppins;at supper I take a bit bread and cheeseand a pint, and so go to bed. Mess Johnsays, Its extravagant $ir, its excessivedrinking, I allow you the one half of itfor a quarter of a year, says Leper, I’lltry it 8ir, and come back and tell you. JAt the end of the quarter he draws outhis account, and goes, to Mess John,who was sitting with the elders in the lisession house, and says Sir, I have a de- |maud on you: on me. Sir ? Yes on you |jSir: Don’t you remember you allowedme so much drink for a quarter of year,and I want the money j am I pay foryour reckoning Sir ? You allowed it, and Iif you won’t pay it, I’ll take you beforethe Provost; The elders advised him topay it, or he would be affronted; so Le- jper £ot the money. When he was at thedoor, he says, Sir, will you stand anither !quarter; Get away, says Mess John, anddon’t trouble me. Leper says 1 am sure 'you may, for I was always twopence to iyour penny.FINIS.

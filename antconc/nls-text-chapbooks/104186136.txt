JAMES GARDINER.OL. JAMES GARDINER was the son of^Captain Patrick Gardiner, who served manyyears in the armies of King William and Queen IAnne ; and died abroad with the British forces in «Germany.The Colonel’s mother was a lady of very excellent fcharacter; but it pleased God to exercise her with ,uncommon trials; for she lost not only her husband Iand her brother, in the service of their country, butalso her eldest son, M. R. Gardiner, on the daywhich completed his 16th year, at the siege of Na¬mur, in 1695. But God blessed these afflictions asthe means of forming her to an eminent degree ofThe second son, the subject of this Memoir, wasborn in Linlithgowshire, Jan. 10, 1687-8 ; the me¬morable year of the glorious revolution, in defenceof which his own life was eventually sacrificed.In early life his mother took care to instruct himwith great tenderness and affection in the principlesof true Christianity. While at the school at Linlith¬gow, he made a considerable progress in literature.In the younger part of his life, the good effects ofhis mother’s prudent and exemplary care were not soconspicuous as she hoped ; yet there is great reasonlo believe they were not entirely lost. Could shehave prevailed, he would not have thought of a mili¬tary life; but it suited his taste ; and die ardour ofhis spirit, animated by the persuasions of a friendwho greatly urged it, was not to be restrained. Norwill the reader wonder at this, when he knows thatthis lively youth fought three duels before he attain¬ed the stature of a man ; in one of which, when buteight years o’d, he received from a boy much olderpiety,C * )than himself a wound in his right cheek, the scar ofwhich was always very apparent. This false senseof honour might seem excusable in those unripenedyears, and considering the profession of his father}but he often mentioned it with regret. And afterhis conversion he declined accepting a challenge withthis truly great reply, which in a man of his experi¬enced bravery, was exceedingly graceful : “ I fearsinning,” said he, “ though you know I do not fearfighting.”He served as a cadet very early ; and, at 14- yearsold, he bore an ensign’s commission in a Scotch re¬giment in the Dutch service ; in which he continuedtill 1702, when he received an ensign’s commissionfrom Queen Anne, which he bore in the battle ofRaraalies, in his 19th year.On this occasion, our young officer was command¬ed on what seemed almost a desperate service, todisposcss the French of the church-yard at Ramilies,where a considerable number of them were posted toremarkable advantage. They succeeded better thanwas expected, and Mr. G. was glad of such an op¬portunity of signalizing himself. Accordingly, hehad planted his colours on an advanced ground, andwhile he was calling to the men, (probably in thathorrid language which is so peculiar a disgrace to oursoldiery,) he received a shot in his mouth, which,without beating out any of his teatli, or touching theforepart of his tongue, went through his neck. Notfeeling, at first, the pain of the stroke, he wonderedwhat was become of the ball, and, in the wildness ofhis surprise, began to suspect he had swallowed it ;but, dropping soon after, he traced the passage of itf by his finger, when he could discover it no «ther’ way.This accident happened about five or six in thei evenir'T, on the 23d of May, in the year 170G ; and! the army pursuing its advantages against the French,' without regarding the wounded, our young officer( * )kijr all night in the field, agitated, as may well be sup¬posed, with a great variety of thoughts. When he re¬flected upon the circumstances of his wound, that a baliishould, as he then conceived it, go through his head,,without killing him, he thought God had preserved him.by a miracle ; and therefore assmedly concluded that heshould live, abandoned and desperate as his conditionjthen saemed. Yet had lie little thoughts of humbling;himself before God, and returning to him after the:wanderings of a life so licentiously begun. But hopinghe should recover, his mind was taken up with contriv¬ances to secure his gold, of which he had nearly 20 pis¬toles about him, and had recourse to a very odd expedi¬ent. Expecting to be stripped, betook out a handfulof clotted gore, of which he was frequently obliged toclear his mouth; and putting it into his left hand, hetook out his money, and, shutting his hand, besmearedthe back of it with blood ; in this position he kept it,till the blood so dried, that his hand could not easilyfall open.In the morning, the French, who were masters «fthat spot, though defeated at some distance, came toplunder the slain, and seeing him, to appearance almostexpiring, one of them was just applying a sword to hisbreast, to destroy the little remainder of life ; v^hen, inthe critical moment, a cordelier, who attended them, in¬terposed taking him by his dress for a Frenchman, andsaid, “ Do not kill the poor child.” Our young soldierheard all that passed, though he was not able to speakone word ; and, opening his eyes made a sign for some¬thing to drink. They gave him a sup of some spirit-ous liquor, which happened to be at hand ; from whichhe said he derived more sensible refreshment than hecould remember from any thing he had ever tasted be¬fore or since. Fhen asking, by signs, the friar to leandown his ear to his nv'ufh, he employed the rirst ef¬forts ol his feeble breath in telling him (what, alas Sw.ts a contrived falsehood) that he was nephew to thegovernor of Huy, a neutral town in the neighbourhood.• ( 5 )and that, if they c<mld convey him thither, he did notdoubt but his uncle would liberally reward them. Hehad indeed a friend there, but the relationship was pre¬tended. However, on hearing this, they laid him on asort of hand-barrow, and sent him with a file of mus-queteers towards the place, but the men lost their wayand got into a wood towards the evening, in which theywere obliged to continue all night. The poor patient’swound being still undressed, it is not to be wonderedat, that by this time it raged violently. The anguish ofit engaged him earnestly to beg that they would eitherkill him outright, or leave him there to die, without thitorture of any other motion ; and indeed they were o-bligcd to rest for a considerable time, on account oftheir own weariness, Thus he spent the second nightin the open air, without any thing more than a commonbandage to staunch the blood, and he often mentionedit as a most astonishing providence, that he did notbleed to death.Judging it quite unsafe to attempt carrying him toHuy, whence they were now several miles distant, hisconvoy took him early in the morning to a convent inthe neighbourhood, where he was hospitably received,and treated with great kindness and tenderness. Butthe cure of his wound was committed to an ignorantbarber-surgeon, who lived near the house. The tentwhich this artist applied was almost like a peg driveninto the wound ; yet, by the blessing of God, he reco¬vered in a few months. The lady abbess, who calledhim her son, treated him with the affection and care ofa mother. He received a great many devout admoni¬tions from the ladies tdiere, and they would fain havepersuaded him to acknowledge so miraculous a deliver-ence, by embracing the Catholic Faith, as they werepleased to call it. But, though no religion lay near hisI heart, he had too much of the spirit of a gentleman,lightly to change that form of religion, which he woreloose about him ; as well as too much good sense, toswallow the absurdities of popery .■When his iiSerty was regained by an exchange ofeprisoners, and his health established, he was far fronsr-tendering unto the Lord according to the mercy he hadu■ experienced. Very little is known of the particulars o|;those wild and thoughtless years which lay between thdi39th and 30th of his life; except that he experiencedthe divine goodness in preserving him in several hot:military actions ; and yet, these years were spent in anentire alienation from God, and an eager pursuit of sen¬sual pleasure as his supreme good.Amidst all these wandrings from religion, virtue, andhappiness, he approved himself so well in his militarycharacter, that he was made a lieutenant in 1708 : and,after several intermediate promotions, appointed majoriof a regiment, commended by the Earl of Stair. InJanuary 1729-30, he was advanced to the rank of lieu¬tenant-colonel in the same regiment: and here continu¬ed till April 1743, when he received a colonel’s com¬mission over a regiment of Dragoons, at the head ofwhich he valiantly fell, about two years and a half afterhe received it.We now return to that period of his life, which pas¬sed at Paris, where he resided in the family of the Earlof Stair, with some interruptions till about the year 1720.The Earl’s favour and -generosity made him easy inhis affairs, though he was, part of the time, out ofcommission, the regiment to which he belonged beingdisbanded. This w as, in all probability, the gayest partof his life, and the most criminal. Whatever good ex¬amples he might find in the family where he lived, it iscertain that the French Court was one of the most dis¬solute under heaven. What, by a wretched abuse oflanguage, have been called intrigues of love and gal¬lantry, constituted, if not the whole business, at leastthe whole happiness of his life ; and his fine constitu¬tion, than which, perhaps, there was hardly ever a bet¬ter, gave him great opportunities of indulging himselfin those excesses; while his good spirits enabled himto pursue his pleasures, in such a manner, that multi-tudes envied him, and catted him bjr Si dreadful kind ofcompliment, “ I he happy rake.”Yet the cheeks of conscience, and some remainingprinciples of so good an education, vronld break in up¬on his most licentious hours ; and when some of 1 isdissolute companions were once congratulating him up¬on his felicity, a dog happening at that time to comeinto the room, he could not forbear groaning inwardly^and saying to himself, “ Oh! that I were that dog !"Such was then his happiness, and such perhaps is thatas hundreds more, who bear themselves highest in thecontempt of religion, and glory in that infamous servi¬tude which they affect to call liberty.Yet in the most abandoned days, he was never fondof intemperate drinking, from which he used to thinka manly pride might be sufficient to preserve personsof sense and spirit: so that, if he ever fell into any ex¬cess of that kind, it was merely out of complaisance.His frank, obliging, and generous temper, procuredhim many friends; and those principles, which render¬ed him amiable to others, not being under the directionof wisdom and piety, sometimes made him more uneasyto himself, than he perhaps might have been if he couldentirely have outgrown them; especially as he was ne¬ver a sceptic in his heart •, but still retained a secret ap¬prehension, that natural and revealed religion was found¬ed in truth. And with this conviction, his notoriousviolations of the most essential precepts of both couldnot but occasion some secret misgivings of heart. Hiscontinual neglect of the great Author of his being, ofwhose perfections he could not doubt, and to whom heknew himself to be under daily and perpetual obliga¬tions, gave him, in some maments of involuntary re¬flection, inexpressible remorse; and this, at times*,wrought upon him to such a degree that he resolved hewould attempt to pay him some acknowledgements.Acordingly, for a few mornings he did it; repeating,in retirement, some passages out of the Psalms and o-ther scriptures, which he still retained in his memory *t s )ami owning, In a few strong words, the many .merciesand deliverances he had received, and the ill returns hehad made for them.But these strains were too devout to continue longin a heart as yet imsanctified : for, how readily soeverhe could repeat such acknowledgments of the divinepower and goodness, and confess his own follies andfaults, he was stopt short by the remonstrances of hisconscience, as to the flagrant absurdity of confessingsins he did not desire to forsake, and of pretendingto praise God for his mercies, when he did not endea¬vour to live to his service. A model of devotion, wheresuch sentiments made no part, his good sense could notdigest; and the use of such language before a heart¬searching God, merely as a hypocritical form, while thesentiments of his soul were contrary to it, appearedto him such daring profaneness, that, irregular as thestate of his mind was, the thought of it struck him withhorror. He therefore determined to make no more at¬tempts of this sort; and was perhaps one of the first thatdeliberately laid aside prayer, from some sense of God’somniscience, and some natural principle of honour andconscience.These secret debates with himself, and ineffectual ef¬forts, would sometimes return; but they were overborne'again and again, by the force of temptation ; and it is ;no wonder, that in consequence of them his heart grewstill harder. Neither was it softened or awakened, bythe very memorable deliverances which at tills time hereceived. Once he was in extreme danger from a fallof his horse. As he was riding fast down a hill, thehorse threw him over his head, and pitched over him ;so that when he rose, the beast lay beyond him, and al¬most dead. Yet, though he received not the least harmit made no serio’us impression on his mind. In his re¬turn from England in the packet-boat, but a few weeksafter the former accident, a violent storm, that drovethem up to Harwich, tossed them from thence for se¬veral hours, in a dark night;, on the coast of Holland,( 9 )and brought them into such extremity, that the captainof the vessel urged him to go to prayers immediately,if he ev r intended to do it at all; for he concludedthey would in a few minutes be at the bottom of thesea. In these circumsta'nces, he did pray, and thatvery fervently too ; and it was remarkable, that whilehe was erving to god for deliverance, the wind fell andquickly after, they artived at Calais. But the Majorwas so little affected with what had befallen him, thatv/hen some of his gay friends, on hearing the story,rallied him upon the efficacy of his prayers he excusedhimself from the scandal of being thought much in ear¬nest, by saying, “ k was at midnight, an hour when hisgood mother and aunt were asleep ; or else he shouldhave left that part of the business to them.”We now come to the account of his conversion.This memorable event happened towards the middle ofJuly 1719, the Major had spent the evening (whichwas Sabbath,) in some gay company, and had an un¬happy assignation with a married lady, whom he was toattend exactly at twelve. The company broke up a-bout eleven; and he went into his chamber to kill thetedious hour. It happened that he took up a religiousbook, (which his good mother or aunt had, without hisknowledge,slipped into his portmanteau,) called, “ TheChristian Soldieror Heaven taken by storm writtenby Mr. Thomas AVatson. Guessing by the title, thathe should find some phrases of his own profession spi¬ritualized, in a manner which might afford him somediversion, he resolved to dip into it: but took no seri¬ous notice of any thing he read : and yet, while thisbook was in his hand, an impression was made uponhis mind, (perhaps God only knows how,) which drewafter it a train of the most important and happy con¬sequences.Suddenly he thought he saw an unusual blaze oflight fall on the-book while he was reading, which he atfirst imagined might have happened by some accidentiathe candle. But lifting up his eyes he apprehended,I( 10 )his extreme amazement, there was before him, as it weresuspended in the air, a visible representation of the LordJesus Christ upon the cross, surrounded with a glory;and was impressed as if a voice, or something equiva¬lent to a voice, had come to him, and to this effect:“ O sinner, did I suffer this for thee, and are these thereturns ?” But whether this were an audible voice, oronly a strong impression on his mind equally striking,he did net seem confident, tho’ he judged it to be theformer: Struck with so amazing a phaenomenon, thereremained hardly any life in him, so that he sunk downin his arm-chtir in which he sat, and continued (he knewnot exactly how long) insensible, and, when he openedhis eyes, saw nothing more than usual.It may be easily supposed that he was in no conditionto make any observation upon the time in which he hadremained insensible : nor did he, throughout all the re¬mainder of the night, once recollect that criminal assig¬nation which had before engrossed all his thoughts,He arose in a tumult of passions not to be conceived,and walked to and fro in his chamber, till he was readyto drop down, in unutterable astonishment and agonyof heart; appearing to himself the vilest of monsters inthe creation of God, who had, all his life time, beencrucifying Christ afresh by his sins, and now saw, as heassuredly believed, by a miraculous vision, the horrorof what he had done. With this was connected sucha view, both of the majesty and goodness of God, ascaused him to loathe and abhor himself, to “ repent” as" in dust and ashes.” He immediately gave judgmentagainst himself that he was worthy of eternal damnati¬on : was astonished, that he had not been immediatelystruck dead in the midst of his wickedness ; and (whichdeserves particular remark) tho’ he assuredly believedthat he should ere long, be in hell, and settled it as apoint with himself for some months, that the wisdomand justice of God did most necessarily require thatsuch an enormous sinner should be made an example ofeverlasting vengeance, and a spectacle as such, both( 11 )to anglls and men, so that he hardly darst presum.to pray for pardon ; yet what he then suffered, was notso much from the fear of hell, tho’ he concluded it mustsoon be his portion, as from a sense of the horrible in¬gratitude he had shewn to the God of his life, and tothat blessed Redeemer who had been in so affecting amanner set forth as crucified before him.In this view, it may naturally be inferred, that he pas¬sed the remainder of the night waking : and he couldget but little rest in several that followed. His mindWas-continually taken up in reflecting on the divine pu¬rity and goodness; the grace which had been proposedto him in the gospel, and which he had rejected ; thesingular advantages he had enjoyed and abused ; andthe many favours of Providence he had received, parti¬cularly in rescuing him from so many imminent dangersof death, which he now saw must nave been attendedwith such dreadful and hopeless destruction. The pri¬vileges of his education, which he had so much despised,lay with an. almost unsupportable weight on his mind ;and the folly of that career of sinful pleasure, which hehad so many years been running, with desperate eager¬ness, filled him with indignation against himself, andagainst the great deciever, by whom (to use his phrase)he had been “ so wretchedly and scandalously befool-The mind of Major Gardiner continued from this re¬markable time, rather more than three months, (but es¬pecially the first of them,) in as extraordinary a situationas one can well imagine. He knew nothing of the joys^arising from a senie of pardon ; but, on the contrary, forthe greater part of that time, and with very short inter¬vals of hope, towards the end of it, took it for grantedthat he must, in all probability, quickly perish. Nevea-theless he had such a sense of the evil of sin, of thegoodness of the Divine Being, and of the admirable ten¬dency of the Christian revelation, that he resolved taspend the remainder of his life, while God continued*him out of hell, in as rational and as useful a manner at.j( 12 )nc could ; and to continue casting himself at the feet ofDivine Mercy, every day, and often in a day, if perad-venture there might be hope of pardon, of which allthat he could say, was, that he did not absolutely despair. .He had, at that time, such a sense of the degeneracy ofhis own heart, that he hardly du^st form any determin¬ate resolution against sin or pretence of God, but w'scontinually crying to him, that he would de'iver himfrom the bondage of corruption. He perceived inhimself a most surprising alteration, with regard tothe dispositions of his heart; so that, tho’ he felt littleof the delights of religious duties, he extremely desiredopportunies of being engaged in them : and those licen¬tious pleasures which had been his heaven, were nowabsolutely his aversion, and he was grieved to see hu¬man nature, even in those to whom he was a stranger,prostituted to such low and contemptible pursuits. Hetherefore exerted his natural courage in a new kind ofcombat, and became an open advocate for religion, inall its principles, so far as he was aquainted with them,and all its precepts, relating to sobriety, righteousnessand godliness Yet he was very desirous and cautiousthat he might not run into an extreme ; and made itone of his first petitions to God, the very day afterthese amazing impressions had been wrought in hismind, that he might not be suffered to behave with suchan affected strictness and preciseness, as would lead o-thers about him into mistaken notions of religion, andexpose it to reproach or suspicion, as if it was an unlov-'ly or uncomfortable thing. For this reason, he endea¬voured to appear as cheerful in conversation as he con¬scientiously could : tho’ in spite of all his precautions,some traces of that deep inward sense which he had ofhis guilt, and misery would at times appear. He m«deno secret of it, however, that his views were entirelychanged, tho’ he concealed the particular circumstancesattending that change. He told his most intimate com¬panions freely, that he had reflected on the course of lifein which he had so long joined them, and found it to be________ _ _    -J( 13 )folly and madness, unworthy a rational creature : andin ich m-re unworthy persons calling themselves Ci>rts-tains, Ami he set up his standard, upon all occ isions,against infidelity and vice, as deteiminately as everh plmted his colours in the field. There was at th«time at Paris a certain Ldy who had imbibed the prin¬ciples of deism, and v.dued herself much upon being theavowed advocate for them.The Major, with his usual franknfess, (though withthat politeness which was habitu il to him,) answeredlike a man who perfectly saw through the fallacy ofher arguments, and was grieved to the heart for herdelusion. On this, she challenged him to debate thematter at large, and to fix upon a day for that purpose,when he should dine with her, attended with Shy cler¬gyman' he might choose. A sense of duty would notallow him to decline his challenge and yet he hadno sooner accepted it, that he was thrown into greatperplexity and distress, lest, being only a Christian ofsix weeks old, he should prejudice so good a cause, byhis unskilful manner of defending it. However, hesought his refuge in earnest and repeated prayers toGod, that he would graciously enable him, on this oc¬casion, to vindicate his truths in a manner which mightcarry conviction along with it. He then endeavouredto marshal the arguments in his own mind, as well a#he could ; and apprehending that he could not speakwith so much freedom before a number of persons, es¬pecially before such whose province he might in thatcase seem to invade, he waited on the lady alone uponthe day appointed.The Major opened the conference with a view ofsuch arguments of the Christian religion as he had di¬gested in his own mind, to prove that the Apostleswere not mistaken themselves, and that they could nothare intended to impose Upon us in the accounts theygive to the grand facts they attest; with the truth ofwhich facts that of the Christian religion is most ap¬parently connected. Ami it was a great encouragementC H )to find that, unaccustomed as he was to discourses of lthis nature, he had an unusual command both of thoughtand expression; so that he recollected and uttered eve-fry thing, as he could have wished. The lady heard Iwith attention, till he had finished his design, and wait¬ed for her reply. She then produced some of her ob¬jections, which he canvassed in such a manner, that, atlength, she burst out into tears, allowed the force of hisarguments and replies, and appeared, for some time af¬ter, so deeply impressed with the conversation, that itwas observed by several of her friends : and there isreason to believe, that the impression continued, at leastso far as to prevent her from ever appearing under thecharacter of an unbeliever, or a sceptic. This is on¬ly one among many of the battles he was almost dailycalled out to fight in the cause of religion and virtue.The continual railleries with which he was received, inalmost all companies where he had been most familiarbefore, did often distress, him beyond measure ; so thathe declared, he would much rather have marched up toa battery of he enemy’s cannon, than have been obligedso continually as he was to face such artillery as this.But, like a brave soldier in the first action wherein heis engaged, he continued resolute, tho’ shuddering at the fterror of the assault; and quickly overcame those im¬pressions which it is not, perhaps, in nature wholly to |avoid. In a word, he went on as every Christian, by [divine grace may do, till he turned ridicule and oppo- |sition into respect and veneration.Within about two months after his first memorablechange, he began to perceive some secret dawnings ofmore cheerful hope, that vile as he then saw himself to ■be , he might nevertheless obtain mercy thro’ a Redeem-er ; and, at length, about the end of October, 17y7, he ifound all the burthen of his mind taken off at once, bythe powerful impression of that memorable scripture u- !■pon his mind: (Rom. iii. 25, 2G ) “ Whom God hath iset forth for a propitiation, thro’ faith in his blood, to i( 15 )declare his righteousness for the remission of sins—fhathe might be just, and the justifier of him that believethin Jesus,” He had used to imagine, that the justiceof God required the damnation of so enormous asinner, as he saw himself to be ! but now he wasmade sensible that the divine justice might be notonly vindicated, but glorified, in saving him by the bloodof Jesus, even that blood which cleanseth from all sin.He was led to see and feel the riches of redeeming loveand grace, in such a manner, as not only engaged him,with the utmost pleasure and confidence, to venture hissoul upon them ; but even swallowed up (as it were)his whole heart in the returns of love, which, from thatblessed time, became the genuine and delightful princi¬ple of obedience, and animated him with an enlargedheart to run the ways of God’s commandments. ThusGod was pleased, (as he himself used to speak,) in anhour, to turn his captivity. All the terrors of his for¬mer state were turned into unutterable joy. And tho*the first extasies of it afterwards subsided into a morecalm and composed delight; yet were the impressionsso deep and so permanent, that he declared, on the wordof a Christian and a friend, wonderful as it might seem,that for about seven years after this he enjoyed nearly aheaven upon earth. His soul was almost continuallyfilled with a sense of the love of God in Christ: so thatfrom the time of his waking in the morning, his heartwas rising to God, and triumphing in him ; and thesethoughts attended him through all the day, till he laydown on his bed again, and a short parenthesis of sleep(for it was but a very short one that he allowed him¬self) invigorated his animal powers for renewing thosethoughts with greater intenseness and sensibility.A life, any thing like this, could not be entered upon,in the midst of such company as he was obliged to keepwithout great Opposition. He, however, early beganpractice, which, to the last day of his life he retained,of reproving vice and profane ness and was never afraidto deMte-the matter with any, under the consciousnes)©i such superiority in the goodness of his cause.A remarkable instance of this happened about thimiddle of the year 1 TdO, on his first return to make amconsiderable abode in England after his remarkablchange. He had heard on the o her side of the watetthat it was currently reported among his companions ahome that he was stark mad ; a report at which no read<;'» wlio knov/s the wisdom of the world in these matters, will be much surprised. He hence concludecthat he should have many battles to fight, and was willing to dispatch the business as fast as he could. Anctherefore, being to spend a few days at the countryhouse of a person of distinguished rank, with whom h«had been very intimate, he begged the favour of hirrthat he would contrive matter', so, that, a day or twtafter he came down, several of their forr er gay companions at his Lordship’s table ; that he might have an opportunity of making his apology to them, and acquainted them with the nature and reasons of his change. Iwas accordingly agreed to; and a pretty large companymet on the day appointed, with previous notice tha.Major Gardiner would be there. A good deal of rail¬lery passed at dinner, to which the Major made ver]little answer. But when the cloth was taken away, amthe servants had retired, he begged their patience for lfew minutes, and then plainly and seriously told thenwhat notions he entertained of virtue and^ religion, ancon what considerations he had absolutely determinedthat by the grace of God, he would make them the canand business of his life, whatever he might lose by itand whatever censure and contempt he might incurHe well knew how improper it was, in such companyto relate the extraordinary manner in which he was a-wakened ; which they would probably have interpretecas a demonstration of lunacy,“against all the gravity ancsolidity of Ins discourse ; but he contented himself wit!-such a rational defence of a sober, righteous, and godl;life, as he knew none of them could with any shadow &( IT )eason Gontest. He then challenged them to proposeny thing they could urge, to prove that a life of irreli-ion and debauchery was preferable to the fear, love andworship of the eternal God, and a conduct agreeable toie precepts of his gospel. And he failed not to bearis testimony, from his own experience, (to one part ofmich many had been witnesses,) that after having runae round of sensual pleasure, with all the advantagesbe best constitution and spirits could give him, he hadever tasted any thing deserving to be called happinessill he made religion his refuge and delight. He testified,almly and boldly, the habitual serenity and peace thate now felt within his own breast, and the composurend pleasure with which he looked forward to objects/hich the gayest sinner must acknowledge to be equally'navoidable and dreadful.Upon this, the master of the table, a person of a veryrank and candid disposition, cut short the debate byfeying; “ Come, let us call another cause: we thoughtthis man mad, and he is in good earnest proving thatve are so. ’ On the whole, this well judged circumstan-lessavedhim a good deal of further trouble. When hisormer acquaintances observed that he was still conver-bble and innocently cheerful, and that he was immove-tole in his resolution, they desisted from further im-(ortunity. And he declared, that, instead of losing anyme valuable friend by this change in his character,ke found himself much more esteemed and regarded byhany who could not persuade themselves to imitate hisxample.Nothing remarkable occured in the Colonel’s life:rom this period till the year 1716, when he married)he Lady Frances Erskine, daughter to the Earl ofpuchan, by whom he had 13 children, five of whomlurvived their father.Before the close of these short memoirs, it may note improper, or without its use, to give the reader ajketch of the character of this excellent man, with re¬ference to his particular relative situations; in some orf M )\«fher of which -the reader may certainly -find a modeworthy of his imitation.To view him first in the calmness of domestic lifeand at the head of his affectionate family—It will naturally be supposed, that, as soon as he had a house, hierected an altar in it ; that the word of God was rea*there, and prayers and praises constantly offered. Thes>were not to be omitted on account of any guest; for hiesteemed it a part of due respect to those that remained under his roof, to take it for granted, they woul*look upon it as a very bad compliment, to imagine thewould have been obliged by his neglecting the dutieof religion on their account. As his family increasedhe had a minister statedly resident in this house, wh«discharged the offices of tutor and chaplain, and was ;»1ways treated with kindness and respect. He was constant in his attendance on public worship, in which aiexemplary care was taken that the children and servant,might accompany the heads of the family.The necessity of being so many months together distant from home, hindered him from many of those condescending labours, in cultivating the minds of hi;children in early life, which to a soul so benevolent, stwise, and so zealous, would undoubtedly have affordeta very exquisite pleasure: but whpn he was with themhe failed not to instruct and admonish them; and thiconstant deep sense with which he spoke of divimthings, and the real unaffected indifference which he al-V'ays shewed for what this vain world is most ready toadmire, were daily lessons of wisdom and of pietyAnd it was easy to perceive that the opening of geniusin the young branches of his family, gave him great de:light, and that he had a secret ambition to see them excein what they undertook. Yet, he was very jealous over his heart, lest he should he too fondly attached tthem, and was an eminent proficient in the blesseiscience of resignation to the divine will.To consider his character in the domestic relation ca master—It is proper to remark, that as his habitus1( w )mteknest^ and command of his passions, prevented in¬decent sallies of ungovernable anger towards those in astate of subjectiot-. to him, so the natural greatness ofhis mind made him solicitous to render their inferiorstations as easy as he could : and he had also such asense of the dignity and worth of an immortal soul, asengaged him to give his servants frequent religious ex¬hortations and instructions.To consider him in his military character—His bra¬very was as remarkable in the field of battle, as his mild¬er virtues in the domestic circle; and he was particu¬larly careful to prevent the various duties of religion,and his profession, from interfering with one another,either in himself, or in others. He therefore abhorredevery thing that should look like a contrivance to keepthe soldiers employed about their horses and their arms,at the season of public worship; far from that, he usedto have them drawn up just before it began, and fromthe parade they w ent off to the house of God, wherethey behaved with as much reverence, gravity and de¬corum, during the time of divine service, as any of theirfellow worshippers.That his remarkable care to maintain good disciplineamong them might be the more effectual, he made him¬self, on all occasions, accessible to them, and expresseda great concern for their interest, temporal as well asspiritual; yet he had all the firmness requisite to theinfliction of punishment, where he judged it necessary.We may notice one instance of his conduct, whichhappened at Leicester. While p.irt of his regiment w asencamped in that neighbourhood, the Colonel went in¬cognito to the camp, in the middle of the night; for hesometimes lodged at his quarters in the town. One ofthe centinels had abandoned his post, and, on beingseized, broke out into some oaths and profane execra¬tions against those that discovered him-a crime ofwhich the Colonel had the greatest abhorrence, and onwhich he never failed t» animadvert. The man after¬wards appeared much ashamed, and concerned for whatTie had done. But the Colonel ordered him to bebrought eitly tile next morning to his own quarters,where he prepared a piquefj on which he appointed hima private sort of pennance ; d while he was put upon,it he discoursed with h'm seriously and tenderly uponthe evils and aggravations of his faults ; admonishinghim of the divine d: ^pleasure which he had incurred ;and urged him to argue, from the pain which he thenfelt, how infinit 'y more dreadful it must be to “ fallinto the hands the living God,” and to meet the ter¬rors of that d-rmation which he had been accustomedimpiously to call ’upon himself and his companions.The result of this proceeding -was, that the offenderaccepted his punishment, not only with submission,but with thankfulness ; and spoke of it some years af¬ter in such a manner, that there seemed reason to hopeit had been instrumental in producing a chajige in hisheart, as well as in his life.Indeed this excellent officer always expressed thegreatest reverence for the name of the blessed God ;and endeavoured to suppress, and if possible, to extir¬pate, that detestable sin of swearing and cursing whichis every W’herc so common, and especially among ourmilitary men. Pie often declared his sentiments with 'respect to' this enormity, at the head of the regiment,and. urged his captains, and their subalterns, to take thegreatest care that they did not give the sanction of theirexample to that, which by their office they w'ere obli- -ged to punish in others. Plis zeal on these occasionswrought in a very active, and sometimes in a remarka¬bly successful manner, among not only his equals, buthis superiors too.\ Nor was his charity less conspicuous than his zeal.The lively and tender feelings of his heart engaged himto dispense his bounties with a liberal hand : and above :all, his sincere and ardent love to the Lord Jesus Christled him to feel, with a true sympathy, the concerns ofhis poor members. In consequence of this, he honour¬ed several of his friends w'ith commissions for the re-j( 21 ).ef of the poor j and esteemed it an honour which Pro-idtnce conferred upon him. that he should be irud*he Lord’s almoner for the relief of such.That heroic contempt of death, which had often di»-:overed itself in the midst of former dangers, was mani-ested now in his discourse with several ot his most in-imate friends. And as he had, in former years, oftenexpressed a desire, “ th.jt, if it were the w ill of God,be might have some honourable call to sacrifice his life,n defence of religion and the liberties of his country»o, when it appeared to him most probable that hemight be Called to it immediately, he met the summonswith the greatest readiness. This appears from a let¬ter which he wrote, only eight days before his death :“ The rebels,” says he, “ are advancing to cross theFrith ; but I trust in the Almighty God, who doethwhatsoever he pleases in the armies of heaven, and a-mong the inhabitants of the earth.”These sentiments wrought in him, to the last, in themost effectual mauner. But he was ordered to march,as fast as possible, to Dunbar* and that hasty retreat inconcurrence with the news which they soon after re¬ceived of the surrender of Edinburgh to the rebels,struck a visible panic into both the regiments of Dra¬goons. This affected the Colon 1 so much, that, onIthe Thursday before the fatal action a Preston Pans, heliutimated to an officer of consic.er.ible rank, that he ex¬pected the erent would be as in fact it proved, and to ai person who visited him, he said, “ I cannot influenceIthe conduct of others as I could wish, out I have oneilife to sacrifice to my country’s safety, nd . shall noti spare it.”On Friday, Sept. 20, (the day before the battle which: transmitted him to his immortal crovt,,) when the'whole army was drawn upanout noon, the Colonel rodethrough all the ranks of his own regiment, addrts.tngthem at once in the most respectfu and uiimating man¬ner, both as sniaiers and as Christ! ns, to engage them: to exert themselves courageously in the service of their( 22 )country, and to neglect nothing that might have a ten-tdency to prepare them for whatever event might happen.They seemed much affected with the address, and ex-tpressed a very ardent desire of attacking the enemy im¬mediately ; a desire, in which he and another gahantofficer of distinguished character would gladly havegratified them, if it had been in the power of either ;but they were over-ruled, and he spent the remainder ofthe day in making as good a disposition as circumstan¬ces would allow.He continued all night under arms, wrapped up inhis cloak, and sheltered under a rick of barley whichhappened to be in the field. About three in the morn¬ing, he called his domestic servants to him, of whomthere were four in waiting. He dismissed three ofthem with the most affectionate Christian advice, andsuch solemn charges relative to the performance of theirduty, and care of their souls, as seemed plainly to inti¬mate that he apprehended he was, probably, taking hislast farewell of them. There is great reason to believethat he spent the little remainder of time, which couldnot be much above an hour, in those devout exercisesof soul which had so long been habitual to him.The army was alarmed by break of day, by the noiseof the rebel’s approach, and the attack was made beforesun rise. As soon as the enemy came within gun-shotthey commenced a furious fire; and the dragoons,which constituted the left wing, immediately fled. TheColonel, at the beginning of the attack, which in thewhole lasted but a few minutes, received a bullet inhis left breast, which made him give a sudden springin his saddle ; upon which, his servant, who had led hishorse, would have persuaded him to retreat; but hesaid it was only a wound in the flesh : and fought on,tho’ he presently received a wound on the right thigh,The Colonel was, for a few moments supported by hismen, and particularly about fifteen dragoons, who stoodby him to the last. But after a faint lire, the regimentin general was seized with a panic ; and tho’ the Colo-( 23 )el and some officers did what they could to rally them,nee or twice, they at last took a precipitate flight. Justi the moment when Colonel Gardiner seemed to be(taking a pause, to deliberate what duty required him too in such circumstances, he saw a party of the foott ho were then bravely fighting near him, but had no of-icer to head them ; upon which he rode up to themttmediately and cried out aloud, “ hire on, my lads andear nothing.” But just as the words were out of hisnouth, a Highlander advanced to him with a scytheastened to a long pole, with which he jjave him suchwound on his right arm, that his sword dropped outif his hand ; and, at the same time, several others com-ng about him while he was thus dreadfully entangledvith that cruel weapon, he was dragged of his horse,the moment he fell, another Highlander gave him atroke, either with a broad-sword, or a Lochaber-axe, onhe head, which was the mortal blow. All that hisaithful attendant saw further at this time was, that, asus hat was falling off, he took it in his left hand, andvaved it as a signal for him to retreat, adding, (whichvere the last words he ever heard him speak,) “ Takeare of yourselfupon which the servant immediatelyted to a mill, at the distance of about two miles fromhe spot on which the Colonel fell ; where he changedis dress, and disguised like a miller’s servant, returnedvnh a cart about two hours after the engagement.The hurry of the action was then pretty w'dl over, andte found his much-honoured master not only plunderedf his watch and other things of value, but also strippedf his upper garments and boots, yet still breathing; anddds, that tho’ he was not capable of speech, yet, on ta-mg him up, he opened his eyes, which makes it some-itung questionable whether he were altogether insensi-[ e- n condition, and in this manner, he conveyedmm to the church at Iranent, whence he immediatelyvas taken into the minister’s house, and laid in a bed,Ivhere he continued breathing till about eleven in thelorcnoon, when he took his final leave of pain and sor-( 2* )row. His remains were interred on the Tuesday follow¬ing, Stpt 21, at the parish church of Tranent, i^wherehe had usually attended on divine service,; with greatsolemnity.FINIS.

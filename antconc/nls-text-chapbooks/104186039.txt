So resolved, so done. A travel¬ling artist was employed ; the ‘ Grey Ass’ wasobliterated; and the Duke ‘reigned in his stead.’Alas, however, for the uncertainty of human cal¬culations ; this event, to which he had lookedforward with the certainty of its increasing hisbusiness, and consequently his coffers, proved toour landlord a source of bitter vexation and dis¬appointment;—a rival in the village had adoptedhis discarded sign, and as the country bumpkinswere better acquainted with their old friend theAss, than with his new successor, the consequencewas that they followed their old acquaintance andleft the Duke £ alone with his glory.’ This was notto be borne; our landlord, having nothing else todo, put his brains to steep to devise some plan tocounteract his fatal error; and the result of hiscogitations appeared shortly after in an additionto his signboard, immediately under the figure ofthe Duke, on which was painted, in large letters,the significant intimation—‘ This is the Old GreyAss.’ Whether the exhibition of the Duke ofWellington, with such an addition to his titles,produced the desired effect, we have not learned.A person desiring to be witty at the expenseof a Jew whom he met, accosted him thus—‘ ’Tisa wonder, Isaac, that we never hear of the deathof a Jew, ora Jack-ass; how does it happen, eh?’Well, mishter,’ replied Isaac, ‘ I does’nt rightlyknow; but perhaps you and I will be the first inthis neighbourhood.’The following exquisite lines, the result of atrue appreciation of the sublime and beautiful innature, are copied from the Album kept at a smallinn on the Banks of the Windermere, in Cum¬berland—I never eats no meat,Nor drinks no beer,But sighs and ruminatesOn Windermere.4Mr, Ogilvie, miaister of tho parish of Lunan, inthe county of Forfar, had a great deal of eccentri¬city in his composition. * One Sunday an old wo¬man, who kept a public-house in the parish, withwhom Mr, Ogilvie was well acquainted, fell asleepin the church during sermon—not an uncommonoccurrence. Her neighbour kept jogging in oMerto awake her. Mr. Ogilvie observing this, criedout, ‘Let her alane, I’ll waken her mysel’, I'llwarrant ye,’—‘ Phew ! phew !

To market a messenger wasdespatched to buy the pig, the company talcingcare that the husband should have no means ofcommunication with home. The pig beingbrought, was sent to his house with this message,‘ that Mrs. P——n was to have the roasting pigboiled, and sent to a certain tavern in time fordinner!’ The messenger, on delivering the pig tocookee, was accosted with, ‘ sure now, the masteris mad!—boil a roasting pig!—By Jasus, I’ll notboil the pig!

He had made but afew miles, when a storm suddenly arising wettedhim to the skin. Surprised at the circumstance,and determined, if possible, to ascertain how anignorant boy had attained a precision and know¬ledge in the weather, of which the wisest philoso¬phers would be proud, he immediately rode back,wet as he was. ‘My lad,’ said Newton, ‘I’llgive thee a guinea if thou wilt tell me how thoucanst foretel the weather so truly.’ ‘Will ye.Sir? I will then,’ said the boy, scratching hishead, and holding out his hand for the guinea.‘ Now, Sir,’ having received the money, and point-to his sheep, ‘ when you see that black ram turnhis tail towards the wind, ’tis a sure sign of rainwithin an hour.’ ‘What! exclaimed the philoso¬pher, ‘must 1, in order to foretel the weather,stay here and watch which way that black ramturns his tail?’ ‘Yes Sir.’ Off rode Newtonquite satisfied with his discovery, but not muchinclined to avail himself of it or recommend it toothers.Military Monosuvre.—A few days sincea gallant and distinguished military officer, who,though unlike Falstaff in one respect, possessesamong other characteristics of that celebrated per¬son, his facetious disposition, and goodness ofheart, was passing along Deansgate, when heobserved a crowd surrounding a shop door, andinquired the cause. He was told that an unluckyurchin had just fractured a pane of glass, and thatthe shopkeeper was detaining. him in pledge forthe payment of the damage. ‘How much is it?*inquired the son of Mars.—* Half-a-crown,’ was7the answer.—‘ Oh, is that all?’ rejoined the officer,and thereupon unbuttoned one of his breeches'pockets which the unwitting shopkeeper consideredas an indication that the money was forthcoming,and with this pleasing anticipation let off the boy,who was soon out of the way. The gallant tacti¬cian observing the succesj at ois pi&n, oau na'.'ingnow had his hand in his povLeta sufficient lengthof time, deliberately re-buttoned up his treasure,and with suitable nonchalance laughed and rodeaway, to the no small’amusement of the spectators,who raised a loud shout at the painful expense ofthe disappointed tradesman.Being in company, and the ‘Tuscan grape’producing more riot than concord, Foote saw onegentleman so far gone in debate as to throw thebottle at his antagonist’s head, upon which,catching the missile in his hand, he restored theharmony of the company, by observing, that if thebottle was passed so quickly, not one of themwould be able to stand put the evening.A lady, seeing her lover running in great haste tomeet her, observed to him, that he must be in avery great hurry to run so fast. ‘Madam,’ repliedthe lover, ‘ 1 was following my inclination.’THE WEEPING WIDOW.Lady B , who, in public, bewails her deadspouse,While in private, her thoughts on another areturning;Reminds us of lighting a fire with green boughs.Which weep at one end, while the other isburning.A Lord Lieutenant, going over to Ireland withbis lady and family, was in his passage, overtaken8by so violent a storm, that the mariners themselvesgave the vessel over for lost, and expected everyminute that she would either founder or go ashore.At this juncture a sailor observing one of the men¬ials standing pale with fear at the cabin door,came up to hiru, and asked him if ever he hadlain with the duchess. * No,’ says the poorfellow, frightened at such waggery in such adangerous time. ‘ Why then,’ says the tar, ‘youhave that pleasure to come; for by G—, weshall lie with her grace in less than half an hour.’The duke, who overheard this, when the stormwas abated, and the danger was over, sent thefellow a handsome present, and forgave him theimpudence of the jest.Accommodation.—The following curiousnotice was affixed to .the residence of a gentleman,whose premises had suffered by some nightly de¬predators.—‘ Notice, those persons who have beenin the habit of stealing my fence for a considerabletime past, are respectfully informed, that if agree¬able to them it will be more convenient to me ifthey steal my wood, and leave the fence for thepresent, and as it may be some little inconveniencegetting over the paling, the gate is left open fortheir accommodation.Anonymous Baptism.—The late Mr. M'Cub-bin of Douglas, a most happy humourist, andwho was seldom outwitted, had his gravity severelyput to the test upon one occasion when officiatingin a neighbouring congregation, by a rustic whowas no less impudent than ignorant. After havingadministered the vows, and received the satisfactorynods, the cjown reached up the child towards thepulpit to receive the initiatory sprinkling withouteither whispering the name or tendering a line to9that effect. The minister had for a considerabletime bent his head, and inclined his head to nopurpose; until at last his patience beginning tofail, ho addressed the sponsor in rather a surlytone, 'Your child’s name ?’ Not a syllable fromthe man !

On riding up to their frpnt, instead ofbeing received with ‘presented arms,’ he found thecorps ‘ standing at ease.’ The Captain had, infact, on first seeing the General, given the word’attention,’ to which no attention was paid—but,10pressed by the General’s rapid approach, he pro¬ceeded to the next order of his formula, ‘shoulderarms.’ To add to his embarrassment, however,the arms moved not. The General, with hischaracteristic goodmature, suggested to the Com¬mandant to speak in a louder tone, who, not alittle indignant, repeated with a Stentorian voice,‘shoulder arms,' but all to no purpose; there stoodthe corps, dogged and motionless. Such a totalapparent ignorance of the manual exercise, na¬turally excited the chagrin of the Captain, and theastonishment of the General, to whom the formeronly a few days before had been puffing off thediscipline of his corps. At length, the Generalhaving intimated his intention of reporting thecorps, was about to leave the field, when a Ser¬jeant with his ‘halbert recovered,’ stepped in frontof the ranks, and addressed the General in thefollowing terms:—‘Plase your honour, General;don’t think the corpse does not know its exerciseas well as any sojers in the land.

After spending the day in dram¬drinking and fun with his cronies, about the ‘go¬ing down of the sun’ he bethought himself of step¬ping home. The landlord of the S publichouse, with the assistance of his stable-boy, gotthe beans, and what was more difficult still, the‘gudemanhimsel” onhorseback. Soofi’Saundersgot almost galloping. Unluckily, however, at asharp turning of the road on his route, down cameour hero, beans an’ a’. The whisky (wae botill’t) had so deranged his powers of perception,that he mounted his bean-sack instead of his mare,that was standing at some distance, no doubt wellpleased to see her master belabouring the bean-sack instead of her own bony protuberances. Atthis moment up comes one of his neighbours, whohad, like himself, staid too long in Falkirk, andseeing a man riding on a sack in the middle of theroad, at that time of the night, made a solemn12pause. After listening a while, he began to con¬jecture who it was, and venturing a little nearer heexclaims,—‘Preserve us, what are you doinghere?’—‘What am I doing here!’ says Saunders,‘I’ve been fechtin' this twa hours wi’ that stupidmare o’ mine, and deil ae fit she’ll lift yet.’MY SHIRT.As Bayes, whose cup with poverty was dash'd,Lay snug in bed, while his one shirt was wash’d;The dame appeared, and holding it to view,Said, ‘If 'tis washed again, ’twill wash in two.'‘Indeed,’ cried Bayes\ then wash it, pray, goodcousin,And, wash it, if you can, into a dozen /’A farmer who regularly attends Devizes market,some short time since, (finding the article unsale¬able) gave another farmer 100 bushels of potatoes,which he was to send for, and on meeting there,the following dialogue took place:—‘ How did the’taties turn out?’ ‘Oh, main, good; I never eatedbetter uns for the time o’year, and they arc prettynigh gone.’ ‘ Well, thee may ha' some more onum if thee likest.’ ‘ Why if I do, thee and memust ha’a fresh agreement.' ‘Fresh agreement!why dint I gie thee the ’taties ?' ‘ Ah, but I can’tafford to ha’ ony more it thee don’t pay one of thepikes!’ The waggon had to pass two turnpikegates, the toll at one was 4d. and the other 4 jd.The Bane and Antidote.—The town bellmanof Kirriemuir having received a written advertise¬ment to that effect, proclaimed in the midst of theassembled multitude, on a fair day, in that ancientburgh of regality or barony, as follows:-—‘ Notish—All persons driving their cattle through the landsof Logie, to or from the market, will be prosecutedlbwith the utmost rigour of law.

Ross, Pit-calnie, an ingenious humourist, who spent his lat¬ter years chiefly in Edinburgh, vvas one night(about the year 1780) reeling home in a state ofintoxication through St. Andrew-Square, whenhis fancy suggested to him the following amusinghoax upon Sir Lawrence Dundas. It occurred tohis remembrance, on seeing Sir Lawrence’s finehouse (now the office of the Royal Bank of Scot¬land), that that gentleman was thee known to heengaged in the laudable business of pievailing uponthe members of the town council of Edinburgh toelect him their representative in parliament, .andthat he had already secured the approbation of somany of these worthy trustees of the public in¬terest that, but for one recusant deacon, he wascertain of his election. It was known that SirLawrence had tried every possible means to bringover this dissentient voice, but hitherto withoutsuccess; and there was some reason to apprehendthat, after all the pains he had expended upon the14rest, the grand object would not eventually be ac¬complished. Pitcalnie bethought him to assumethe name of the deacon, to enter the house of thecandidate, call for what entertainment he pleased,and, finally, as Sir Lawrence was confined to bedwith gout, to go away without being discovered.No sooner had he settled the plan in his own mindthan he proceeded to put it in execution. Reel¬ing up to the door he rung the bell with all theinsolent violence which might have been expectedfrom so consequential a person as the individual hewished to personate, and presently down came ahalf-dressed lacquey, breathing curses, not loud butdeep, against the cause of this unseasonable annoy¬ance. ‘Tell your master,' said’Pitcalnie, ‘thatDeacon (mentioning the name of the impor¬tant elector) wishes to see him.’ When the manwent up, and told Sir Lawrence that Deacon had come drunk to the door, wishing to seehim, the heart of the old gentleman leapt withinhim, and ho instantly sent down his complimentsto his respected visitor, begging him to excuse hisnon-appearance, which was only owing to extre¬mity of illness, but entreating that he would enter,and in every respect use the house as his own.Pitcalnie grunted out an assent to the last part ofthe message, and, being shown into a room, beganto call lustily about him. In the first place heordered a specimen of Sir Lawrence’s port, nextof his sherry, then of his claret, and lastly of hischampagne. When he had drunk as much as hecould, and given a most unconscionable degree oftrouble to the whole household, he staggered off,leaving it to Sir Lawrence to come, next day, tothe best explanation he could with the deacon.‘ If Britannia rules the wraves,’ said a qualmish16writing-master, going to Margate in a storm, ‘Iwish she'd rule them straighter.’An Irishman having a looking glass in his hand,shut his eyes, and placed it before his face; anotherasking him why he did so, ‘Upon my soul,’ saysTeague,‘it is to see how 1 look when I am asleep.’A lady that had married a gentleman who wasa tolerable poet, one day sitting alone with him,said, ‘come my dear, you write upon other people—prithee, write something for me: let me see whatepitaph you’ll bestow on me when dead.’ ‘Oh !my dear,’ replied he, ‘that’sa melancholy subject!don’t think of it.’ ‘ Nay, upon my life, you shall,’says she; ‘come, I’ll begin: Here lies Bid.’ Towhich he answered, ‘Ah !

He was found in this situation whenthe dead cart went its rounds; and the carter,supposing that the man was dead, made no scrupleto put his fork under the piper’s belt, and hoistedhim into his vehicle, that our Scottish musicianshould share the usual brief ceremonies of ;nter-ment. The piper’s faithful dog protested againstthis seizure of his master, jumped into the cart af¬ter him, to the no small annoyance of the men,whom he would not suffer to come near the body;he further took upon himself the office of chiefmourner, by setting up the most lamentable how¬ling as they passed along. The streets and roadsby which they had to go being very rough, thejolting of the cart, added to the howling of the dog,had soon the effect of awakening our drunken mu¬sician from his trance, ft was dark; and the piper,when he first recoverd hiniself, could form no ideaeither of his numerous companions, or his con¬ductors. Instinctively, however, he felt for hispipes, and playing up a merry Scottish tune, ter¬rified in no small measure the carters, who fanciedthey had got a legend of ghosts in their convey¬ance. A little time, however, put all to rights ;—lights were got, and it turned out that the noisycorpse was the well known living piper, who wasjoyfully released from his awful and perilous si¬tuation. The poor man fell badly ill after hisunpleasant excursion, and was relieved during hismalady by his former benefactor, who, to perpe¬tuate the remembrance of so wonderful an escape,resolved, as soon as his patient recovered, to em¬ploy a sculptor to execute him in stone.

'odsli iod ai tHighland Simplicity.—A poor simple High¬lander, who last week made his appearance at24Stirling shore and purchased a cart of lime, metwith an adventure sufficiently untoward. Donaldhad no sooner got his cart well filled, than hfeturned his own and his horses head to his owndear Highland hills. He had not, however, gotfar beyond Stirling bridge, when a smart showerof rain came on. The lime began to smoke.Donald, who was sitting on the front of his cart,at first Supposed it to be nothing but a whiff ofmountain mist, but at last becoming enveloped inthe cloud, and no longer able to see his way be¬fore him, he bethought him it was time to cast alook behind, and was not a little amazed to dis¬cover that the whole cause of the annoyance pro¬ceeded from his cart of lime. It was on fire, buthow was beyond his comprehension. He stopthis Horse and stood still, in hopes the rain wouldquench the intruding element, but remarking noabatement, he next drove his cart to a stream at ashort distance, and taking his shovel, began busilyto throw water upon his smoking load. Thisspeedily brought Donald's difficulties to a crisis,for his steed, unaccustomed to. the heat whichthreatened to deprive oim of his tail, began nowto exhibit symptoms of open rebellion. Besides,seeing that his cart wcj in danger of being burntto a cinder, and not knxring but the horse mighttake it into his head 0 commence burning too,he was resolved the beV *ched load and ‘ the puirbeast and braw bit cart,’ should instantly be dis¬united.

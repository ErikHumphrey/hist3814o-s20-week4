FAREWKLL!—BUT WHENEVER YOU WELCOMETHE HOUR.Won!* bj Moore. ,Farewell! but whenever you welcome the hour,That awakens the night-song of mirth in your bower,Then think of the friend who once welcomed it too.A nd forgot his own griefs to be happy with you.His griefs may return—not a hope may remainOf the few that have brighten’d his path-way of pain—Rut he ne’er will forget the short vision that threwIts enchantment around him, while ling’ring with you.And still on that evening, when pleasure fills upTo the highest top sparkle each heart and each cup,Where’er my path lies, be it gloomy or bright,My soul, happy friends ! shall be with you that night;—Shall join in your revels, your sports, and your wiles,And return to me, beaming all o’er with your smiles !■—Too bless’d if he tells me that, ’mid the gay cheer,Some kind voice had murmur’d, “ I w'ish he were here l’Let fate do her worst! there are relics of joy,Bright dreams of the past, which she cannot destroy.Which come, in the night-time of sorrow and care,And bring back the features that joy used to wear.Long, long be my heart with such memories filled ;Like the vase in which roses have once been distill’d!You may break, you may ruin the vase, if you will;But the scent of the roses will hang round it still.I HERE’S A HEALTH, BONNIE SCOTLAND, TO THEE.J A B&U&d, Sane by MntlAme Vestri*.

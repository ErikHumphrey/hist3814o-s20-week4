CUM M TNG,FINTRAY, ABEBJJBBN.MDCCCIXXTV.PREFATORY NOTE.James Hyslop, author of the following Poem, was bom inthe parish of Kirkconnel, Dumfriesshire. He was for sometime a shepherd in the parish of Muirkirk, hence wasknown as “the Muirkirk Shepherd.” He was the authorof another highly popular poem, beginning, “ In a dreamof the night I was wafted away.” This gifted peasant diedmany years ago, in sailing to a foreign land.The present poem was written on the murder of JohnBrown of Priesthill, Muirkirk, Ayrshire, who on the firstday of May, 1685, was shot to death at the door of his owncottage, as narrated in the poem. John Brown’s smallpossession is situated in one of the most lonely moors inScotland; not a house or field being in sight of it. Buteven there the blood-thirsty underlings of an infamousGovernment could not permit the inoffensive man of 58years of age to live. To this hour many a pilgrim, with aswelling heart, visits the lonely grave and modest monu.ment of “the Christian Carrier.”The engraving represents the monument erected in 1826.Inside the enclosure is the original flat grave stone, onwhich is the following inscription:—“Here lies the body of John Brown, martyr, who was Murdered inthis place by Graham of Claverhouse for his testimony to the Cove¬nanted work of Reformation, because he durst not own the authorityof the then tyrant destroying the same, who died the first day of MayA.D. 1685, and of his age 68.”“In death’s cold bed the dusty part here lyesO f one who did the earth as dust despise.H ere in this place from earth he took departure:N ow he has got the garland of the martyr.B utchered by Claverse and his bloody band,R aging most ravenously over all the land,O nly tor owning Christ’s supremacy.W ickedly wronged by encroaching tyranny,N othing how near soever he too goodEsteemed, nor dear for any truth his blood.’’THE CAMERONIAN’S VISION.From the climes and the seas of the fair sunny south,I return’d to the gray hills and green glens of youth:By mountain graves musing on days long gone past,A dream-like illusion around me was oast.8THU Ci.MEHONIA.K’9 VlSIOIf.In a vision, it seem’d that the chariot of timeWas roll’d ba<k till I stood in the ages of crime,.When the king was a despot, who deem'd with his nodHe would cancel the bond, bound a nation to God.The religion of Christ, like a lamb took its flight,As the horns of the Mitre wax’d powerful in might, _And the prelates with priestcraft men’s spirits enchain d,Till they fear’d to complain when their heart s blood wasdrain’d.Stern law made religion no longer a linkThe soul to sustain on eternity’s brink;But the gold of the gospel was changed to a chain,The spirit of Scotland to curb and restrain :A political bridle the people to check,When the priest or the prince chose to ride on their neck;For churchmen a chariot in splendour who roll d,At the poor man’s expense, whose salvation they sold.From the court, over Scotland went forth a decree—“ Let the Kirk of the north to the king bend the knee :To the prince and his priesthood divine right is given,A sceptre to sway both in earth and in heaven.“ Let no one presume from the pulpit to readThe Scriptures, save curates by courtiers decreed ;At their peril, let parents give precepts to youth,Till prelates and prayer-books put words in their mouth.And none 'mong the hills of the heather shall dareTo meet in the moorlands for praises and prayer;Nor to Heaven in private prefer their request,Except as the prince shall appoint by the priest.”The nation of Knox held the mandate accurs d:(He the fetters of popery and priestcraft had burstWiththe stamp of his foot brought their towers to the ground,Till rovalty trembling shrunk back when he frown d.And Melville, the fiery, had fearlessly dar’d,In a prince’s own presence his priesthood to beard.On the archbishop s head made his mitre to shake.And the circle of courtiers around him to quake.)So Scotland’s Assemblies in council sat down,God’s word well to weigh with decrees of the crown:* TH* CUMBHONUN'l Vliioy,TheiramunanVfal,d’ 8Wore hy the ^ord,Iheir Bibles and birthrights to guard with the swcrd.These Priests from their kirks by the prelates were driv«nA shelter to seek with the fowls of theM^nT ' 'I he wet mist their covering, the heather their bed.By the springs of the desert in peril they fed.At the risk of their lives, with their flocks they would meetIn the storm and m tempest, in rain and in sleet; ’Tnth!!

Around me are someWho may watch, for they know not the hour He shall come.“ And thou, pretty maiden, rejoice in the truthOf the lover I link for thy husband of youth.Be kind while he lives; clasp him close to thy heart;For the time is not far when the fondest must part.“ The seal of the Saviour is printed too deepOn the brow of thy bridegroom for thee long to keep.The wolf round the sheepfold will prowl for his prey.And the lamb be led forth for the lion to slay.“ His winding-sheet linen keep woven by thee;It will soon be requir’d, and it bloody will be.A morning of terror and tears is at hand,But the Lord will give strength in thy trial to stand.”My vision was changed: happy summer had fledO’er the heath-circled home where the lovers were wed;Affection’s springs bursting from hearts in their prime,The stream of endearment grew deeper with time.At the door of his home, in a glad summer’s nmht,With his children to play was the father’s delight;One dear little daughter he fondly caress’d,For she look’d like the young bride who slept on his breast.Of her sweet smiling offspring the mother was fain,Each added a new link to love’s wedded chain;One clung to her bosom, one play’d round her knee,And one ’mong the heather ran chasing the beeIn union of warm hearts, of wishes, of thought,The prophet’s prediction was almost forgot;With wedded affection their hearts overflow’d,And their lives passed in rearing their offspring to God.The mist of M ay morning lay dark on the mountains ;The lambs crept the o.-.-ers springingfresh by the fountains;The waters, the wo. Is, and the green holms of hay, layIn sunshine asleep down in Wellwood’s wild valley.7THE CAUEHONIAN’S VISION.In Pries thill at dawin" the psalm had ascended.The chapter been read, and the humble knee bended;Now in moors thick with mist, at his pastoral employment,The meek soul of Brown with his God found enjoyment.At home, Isabella was busy preparingThe meal, with a husband so sweet aye in sharirig;In the cradle beside her the infant lay smiling,The mother with sweet songs its fancy beguiling.His daughter went forth in the dews of the morningTo meet on the footpath her father returning;Alone ’mong the mist she expected to find him,But horsemen in armour came riding behind him.The mother, in trembling, in tears, and dismay,Clasped her babe to her bosom, and hasted away;She clung to her husband, distracted and dumb,For she felt that the hour of her trial was come.But vain her distraction, her tears and her prayer.Her sufferings by Claver’se were held light as air;With his little ones weeping around him, he broughtThe fond father forth, in their sight to be shot.“ Bid farewell thy family, and welcome thy death,Since thou choosest so fondly to cherish thy faith;Some minutes my mercy permits thee for prayer.Let six of my horsemen their pistols prepare.”“ My widow, my orphan, 0 God, I resignTo thy care ; and the babe yet unborn, too, is thine;Let thy blessing be round them, to guard and to keep,When over my green grave forsaken they weep.”At the door of his home, on the heather he knelt;His prayer for his family the pitiless felt;The rough soldiers listened with tears and with sighs,Till Claverhouse cursed him, and caused him to rise.For the last time the lips of his young ones he kiss’d.His dear little daughter he clasped to his breast:“ To thy mother be kind, read thy Bible, and pray;The Lord will protect thee when I am away.“ Isabella, farewell! Thou shalt shortly beholdThy love on the heather stretch’d bloody and cold.THE CAMEBOJfIAN'8 VISION.The hour I’ve long looked for hath come at the last—■Art thou willing to part ?—all its anguish is past.”“ Yes willing,” she said, and she sought his embrace.While the tears trickled down on her little one’s face,“ ’Tis the last time I ever shall cling to thy heart.Yet with thee T am willing, yes, willing to part."’Twas a scene would have softened the savage’s ire;But Ulaver'se commanded his horsemen to tire;As they cursed his command, turning round to retreat,The demon himself shot him dead at his feet.His temples, all shatter’d and bleeding she bound,While Ciaver’se with insult his cruelty crown’d;“ Well, what thinkest thou of thy heart’s cherished pride!It were justice to lay thee in blood by his side.”“ I doubt not, if God gave permission to thee,That thou gladly wouldst murder my offspring and me:But thy mouth he hath muzzled, and doom’d thee, in vain,Like a bloodhound, to bay at the end of thy chain.“ Thou friendless, forsaken, hast left me and mine.But my lot is a bless’d one when balanced with thine,With the viper remorse on thy vitals to prey.And the blood on thy hands that will ne’er wash away.“ Thy fame shall be wafted to all future time,A proverb for cruelty, cursing, and crime;Thy dark picture, painted in blood, shall remainWhile the heather waves green o’er the graves of the slain.“Thy glory shall wither; its wreaths have been gain’dBy the slaughter of shepherds, thy sword which disdain’d:That sword thou hast drawn on thy country for hire.And the title it brings shall in blackness expire.“Thy name shall be Ciaver’se, the bloodthirsty Scot,The godly, the guiltless, the grayhair’d, who shot.Bound my Brown’s bloody brow glory’s garlands shall wave,Wj»'" the muse marketh ‘ murderer’ over thy grave!”it ASKS OI' THE (JeaWKJK.

AtJaft,grew Rich, lived Honeft, and dieda Penitent.FALKIRK:Printed and fold by PATRICK MAIR.ijftotfilliMDCCLXXXVIir.* OF SCOTLAND .*Xhg Hijiery of the famous Moll Flaridtrs,THE mofl: remarkable account IIcan give of my parents is, that)my father was bang’d for felony,and my mother tranfported forthe fame faff, after Hie was delivered of]me in Newgate, from whence I was Itaken by fome gypfies, who left me atColcheller, I then not being above threeyears of age.There the magiffrates taking pity onme, and took care of me till 1 wasthirteen years of age; and then beingfancied by a rich gentlewoman, I(hared in the eduation of her daugh-iters, learning to dance, fpeak French,and play upon mulical inffruments.Thefe qualifications, together with mybeauty, caufed my lad’s eldeft fon topretend love to me; and at lafl withhis alluring fpeeches, his powerful gold,melting kiffes, and fair promifes thathe would marry me when he came tohis eflate, prevailled upon me to furre-nder my virginity to him, and permithim to ufe me whenever he had willand opportunity.But fcarce a year was gone beforeihls' younger brother made love to me 10,lialfo, in fuch an open manner that ailithe family took notice of it; but howI fhould be a wife to him and a whore> to his brother, I could not think ofjjbut with the utmoft abhorrence, I lov-tling the former to extremity. But theiyounger brother preffed nje lb hard,[jthat I could not know what to make ofLit; and he even told his mother, that:j he was pofitive to marry me, let thea event be what it would. In fliort, thei difpute ran lb high ’twixt his motheri and him, that Hie refolved to turn me3 off from the family, and what was toI become of me then, put me to a ladi conflemation, as I had no friends tol take me by the hand or fopport me,j and at any event my character would\ be ruined. I at lall was obliged to! make my cafe known to his elder bro-i ther, and put him in mind of his 1b-I iemn promifes he made to me of mar-t riage, which at firft feemed to llartlei him not a little; but he excufed him-i felf in not performing what he had; promiled, on acount that he was not; come to the pofleilion of his ellate,his father being Hill alive, tho’ notthen in this country, and if he was t{own his marriage with me he wouldbe cli(inherited, and we -would be bothundone; but he promifed to give mehis heft advice how I fliould behavein the matter; fo we parted for thattime. The next opportunity I prefledhim hard what I fliould do in this myunhappy lit nation. After a little file neehe plainly told me, that the only wayhe could think of to lerve us both, wasto comply with his brother’s propofal,which, he had no foon'er mentioned,than I was fit to have funk down thro,the chair I fat on with horror and fur-prife, and fainted away. After I hadrecovered myfelf a little, he continuedto foothe me with many flattering,words, and at the lame time, infillingas before, of' the unavoidable ruin itwould be to us both, if I did not com¬ply; and at the lamer time, told me,that confidering his brother’s paflionfor me, he made no doubt of procur¬ing his mother’s confent to the mar¬riage; but I bitterly reproached him,how he thought I could be his whore,and a wife to his brother. But to befliort, he manag’d matters fo well that,n afliort time he obtain’d hU mother’si;onfent. To that I was under the fatal‘ leceifity, either to comply, or be un¬done ; and as I found at any rate thedder brother was to call me off, andas I was not with child to him, con-dented, tho* with much reluffance,tfo we were married privately.' I had my own fears now, lead mynew married fpoufe, who I had notthe lead affeclion for, might be fkil-ful enough to know tiie difference be¬tween a maid and a whore; but theelder brother manag’d it fo, whetherwith a defign or ndt I cannot fay, but1 had the pleafure of a drunken bed¬fellow the lird night; by which meanshe fairly fnifted me into his brother’sarms for a chade virgin.About five years after he died, leav¬ing two children, who were taken careof by his parents. Having now a to¬lerable fortune, I foon married a lineb.draper, who foon went from ihe fordebt into France : on which I took alodging, and in a widow’s habit, tookupon me the name of Mrs Flanders. tI was courted as a miftrefs by fe-veral lewd men, but thofe I treatedu *ne toriunes and Misfortuneswith fcorn and contempt. At length,,I married a gentleman, whole eltatewas in Virginia, whom I deceived by|pretending I had a great fortune. Heproved to be a very good hufband, andtook me over to Virginia, where I waskindly received by his mother.But here I found that my familywas of the Newgate train, fhe fhewingme where (he had been burnt in thehand, bidding me not to wonder, formajor B. had been an eminent pick¬pocket; juflice D. a fhop-Hfter, andTom W. who had narrowly eicapedthe nubbing-poft, was there metamor-phofed into a diflenting preacher.Here, I lived three years before Ihad a child, but not without an in¬ward remorfe, knowing that my le-cond hulband was not dead; and thislet me upon returning to England, Iteafing my fpoufe for that purpofe,who wanted to know ahe true realbnof it; but I told his mother who cameto pump me, that the ftory fhe toldme of her being tranfported confirmedme in the belief of her being mymother, who was delivered of me inNewgate, by which means file wasof the Famous Mull tlanders.7Ifaved from the gallows, and that ruyhufband was my brother. This verymuch furprifed her, and (lie infilledmpou me keeping it a fecret, which Ijpromiled, but did not perform.But I dreaded the thought of ano¬ther child, and fo difclofed all the:matter to my hufband, to preventmy cold nefs to his embraces. Thismade him fall into fo deep a melan¬choly, that he twice attempted to de-flroy himfeff, but was prevented. Atlength, I obtained his leave, to returnto England, which I did, after eightyears flay in that country. Landingat Milford Haven, and ibon after inLondon.Soon after, I went to Bath, whereI was courted by a gentleman, andfrom whom I received fcveral prefents,'viz. loo guineas at one time, and 50! at another, for taking care of him ini a fit of illnefs. In fhort I took him forjmy bed friend; but at length he got1 me with child, and I was delivered1 of a fine boy. From Bath we remov-1 ed to Hammerfmith, near London.Six years did I live with this gen¬tleman, and had three children by~rrxrVhim; at length he fell lick at Bloomf-bury, in a houie he had taken for hidwife and family. But, upon his re¬covery, I found 1 was flighted, nodoubt through remorfe of confcience,yet, he lent a letter with a bank noteof fifty pounds, promifing to takecare of my little boy, the other twobeing dead. I wanting to get anotherfifty pounds from .-him, flgned a gen¬eral releafe, which put an end toflintNor long after, I got acquaintedwith a clerk belonging to the Bank,whofe wife having made him a cuc¬kold, by the help of an officer of thearmy, and after that, with a draper’sapprentice. I had like to have becomehis bride, he promifing on that accountto fue for a divorce from his v'ife:But while this was tranllnSting, I goingdown into Lancafliire, and palling fora fortune of L. [5,000,  wasmarried to an Irifli gentleman by aRomifh clergyman.But finding that I had* no Inch ef-fcxds as had been reprefented, nor heany eflate more than what he hadipenf upon, his equipage in courtingvj ir.e r OTTjoas ivxoii riajmcrj.yi^e, he left me as much money aswould bear my charges to London,difcharged me from the marriage,left a Ifette for me on the table, andwent away in the morning; but afterhe had di(charged his fervants, he ret¬urned at niglit, to my great joy, andaccompanied me as far as Dimitable,whpere we parted, after mutual inhru-(Tcions for our future courfe of life, andwillies for our well-being.At London I lodged in an old mid,wife’s hotife, I being then big withchild, where, as I had given infrruc-tions, a letter was fent me'from Lan-cafhire, which had been diredted thi¬ther by tiie cleric of the Bank, whotold me he had obtained a decreetagain ft his wife, and that lie was atmy fervice. I lent an anfwer under acover, that I fhouid be in town thelatter end of the year.At length having opened the mat¬ter to my landlady, the midwife, whopropofed to aflift me in the affair, andbeing delivered of abrave boy. whichwith much difficulty, I allowed her‘ to difpofe of. I went to Lancashire,and there taking a coach, wrote alo ihe Fortunes ana misfortunes\letter to my clerk to meet me at Brick-hall, where we were married.Next day, from the window of theinn where we lay, I faw my Lanca-fliire husband, with two others, paftby, and foon after they were purliiedas highwaymen.My huband and I returned to town,where we lived very happy for theipace of five years, by whom I hadtwo children, when I rewarded mvmidwife for her fidelity. But my hus¬band's dark robbing him, it caft himin a confumption, which ended hislife, and my happinefs together.Soon alter this, being reduced togreat extremity, I was tempted tofteal a fmall bundle out of an apothe¬cary’s (hop in Leadenhall-flreet, inwhich I found a fuit of child-bed li¬nen, fome fine lace, a filver mug, fixfpoons, three fliillings, and fome oth¬er matters.Afterwards I inveigled a little childfrom whom I took a gold necklace;but tho’ I had it in a private place, Idid not kill it, but put it in its wayhome again. Another time I took out «of a fliop at Stepney twro rings, one aof the Famous Moll Flanders* itiliamond, and the other a pla’ni one.Once a thief being purfu’d in Lorn-syard ftreet, dropped a bundle of filk,vhich I made pif with, and difpofed►f it to good advantage, and not~asEieves generally do, for a fbng.Another time I Hole a filver tank-d out of an ale-lioufe, whicli I folda pawn-broker, who encoura ged.me in fuch things, who (liortly help*id me to a midrels, wlio made menore expert hi the thieving art, butiot more fortunate;, for (lie herfelf,nd one of her fcholars, were loonent to Newgate for Healing two pie-:es of cambric from a linen-draper in^heapfide. Both of them were con-iemned to die, but only our tutorefsvas executed, tire other coming. ofT~vith a circuit pardon.I refleft much upon one crime Ihommitted, in taking from the hanpsa gentlewoman a bundle of plate,,vhen her houfe was on lire, and con-eyed it to my own houfe.So fortunate was I in efcaprng,. thatbecame remarkable among the thie—'■'es ; none fo great as Moll Flanders;Hit at length being threamed by fome^12 'The Ftrlunes and Misfortunesin Newgate, I clothed myfelf in man’sapparel, tho’ my fmooth lace, (other-1wife pepfonable and tall enough), mighthave foon betrayed me.I kept company with another thief,who being purfn’cl as he was healingoff Tome goods, was unfortunatelytaken; but I, with much difficulty,made my efcape. And indeed, had mybrother thief known of my being awo-.man, I fliould have been betray’d; butthrowing off my man’s apparel, hadfometime after, the fatisfadon to fee1pm liang’d. ^My name was as well known at theOld Bailey, as a remarkable traitor isat the Secretary’s office.Being now an excellent pick-pocketas vrell as a whore, I took from a culi,after I had made him, drunk, his goldwatch, purfe of gold, fine perriwig,fword, and fnuff-box, and leaping outof the coach, (which flopped to let an¬other pals by it), and left my ihor,ingfool to lament his dilafler.This fuccefs made me follow whor¬ing again, but finding the profit of ittoo little to fuport me, I fluck prin¬cipally to my trade of (hop-lifting.of'the Famous Molt 'Tldnders. 13One day as I was walking along theI ftrect, near Covent-garden, there'wasa cry of, Stop thiei, a mercer’s fnopbeing robbed, and I was lecured as atranlgreflbr; and haughtily infulteti bythe mercer and his fervants.In a little time they got the right thief,who-was much in the fame habit, butfor this affront, I threat ened to profe-cute him at law, and obliged him. tocome to an agreement, where I got anhundred &: fifty pounds, which with myother fubfiftence might have done wellto have maintain’d me; bat having gotfuch an itch for thieving, 1 could notleave it off.I had the opportunity of commen¬cing a coiner, but that being fuch abeggarly, and yet fo dangerous a bu-fmefs, that I could never embark in it;nor could I be brought into the focieiyof houfe-breakers.No perlbn could be more dexterousat healing gold watches from ladiesTides, either at the Park, play-houfe, orth© church. But to particularife themall, would be tedious.I was very dexterous at gaming,and, at one time cleared 73 guineas.14 For tuns and Misfortunes•»»The uncommon fticcefs I had metwith, made me go into the country,and at Cambridge, Sturbitch fair, andNevv-market, I very expertly per¬formed the fame pranks.At Ipfwich, I robbed a gentlemanof a portmanteau, by pretending tobe his wife, at an inn, in which wasa large quattity of gold and filver.Being come to London, and ventur¬ing into a Silver-fmith’s fhop, whenno one was there, I was perceived bya fhop-keeper over the way; but as fhad got a glance of him, I medledwith nothing: and, a juftice of thepeace jull then coming by, being calledin, cleared me with flying colours.Another time g-ing into a millin¬er’s (hop in Cheapfide, and cheapen¬ing half a dozen of Holland fliifts, Idoubted the length of them, uponwhich, fhe flipped one of the fliiftsupon her, which gave me an oppor-:unity to pin it with two or three pins;o her petticoat; and then taking uphe refl’ with feveral fine pieces ofnuflin, I ran away out of the fhop.The milliner, endeavouring to pull offhe finock, pulled up her petticoats,of the Famous Molt rlanders, iytnd riming after me, cried out, Stophief, flop thief, with all file had ex-lofed to the public; who taking heror a mad woman, l got clear off withny booty; and fhe was^antered toaer dying day, beddes loling the va¬lue of eighty pounds worth of muflin.But at lafl, happening to deal fomebrocaded filk from a mercer’s (hop, 1was apprehended, and carried beforea juft ice and committed to Newgate,the place of my nativity; where it isimpoftible for me to exprefs the hor¬ror of my difeonfolate mind. Hereall the wretches triumphed over me.What! laid they, is Mrs Flanderscome to Newgate! what, Mrs Mary!and afterwards, plain Moll Flanders*They thought the devil had helpedme, they faid, that I had reigned lblong, and a deal to, that purpofe j then,(called for brandy, and drank to me,and put it all to my fcore; for theytold me, that I was juft: now come tothe college, as they called it, and fureIhad money in my pocket, tho’ theyhad none; but it was a horrible anddifmal place to me, tlio’ they feemedto make very light of it;16 I he renuns ana misjommcsI aflcecl one of this crew.

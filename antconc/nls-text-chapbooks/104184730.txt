away the cruel sway,Tyrannic man’s dominion ;The i-portraan’s joy, the murd’ring cry,iUe flutt’ring gory pinion!3But, Peggy dear, the evening's dear,Thick dies the skimming swallow ;The sky is blue, the fields in viewAll fading-green and yellow :Come, let us stray our gladsome way,And view the charms of nature ,The rustling corn, the bushy thorn,And every happy creature.We’ll gently walk, and sweetly talk.Till the silent moon shhie clearly ;I'll grasp thy waist, and fondly press’t.Swear how I love thee dearly.Not vernal show'js to budding flow’rs,Nor autumn to the farmer,So dear can be as thou to me.My fair, my lovely charmer.IT WAS UPON A LAMMAS NIGHT,It was upon a Lammas night.When coin-rigs were bonnie.Beneath the moon’s unclouded light,1 hied avva to Annie ;The time flew by wi' tentless heed,Till, ’tween the late and earlyWi’ sma’ persuasion she agreedTo see me tnrough the barley.’The ;ky was blue, the wind was still,The moon was shining clearly .I set her down, wi’ right good-will.4Aniang the rigs o* barlej t1 kert ?>.'■ heart was a’ my ain,i K'v’d her most sincerely;^ kis»'<l her o’er and o’er againAmang the rigs o bariey.I loc v d her in my fond embrace^Her heart was beating rarely;My bk: sing on t-' a' happy placeArming the rigs o’ barley !But by the moon and stars so brightTint -hone t at night so clearly,She ay shall bliss that happy night.Amang the rigs o’ barley.I hae been blythe wi’ comrade* dearsI hae been merry drinkin’,I hae been joy ru gath’rmg gear,I hae been hajtpy tbinkin’:But a’ the pleasures e’er I saw.Though shree tiines doubled fairlvThat happy night w^rs worth them a’Amang the rigs o’ bai ley.BURNS’S FAREWELL TO AYEScenes of woe, and scenes of pleasure,Scenes that former thoughts renew,Scenes of woa, ai d scenes of pleasure,Now a sad and last adieu !Bonny Boon, sae sweet at gloaming,Fare thee weel before I gang iI ^Sonny Doon, where, early roaming,i First I weav’d the rustic aang !lowers, adieu!

;iut God be blest who past thee ^ n()iAnd did a Saviour provide;1?or Adam’s whole posterity,All those who do in him confide,fdieu false fiend I may not bide, , ,$ilh thee I may no longer stay ; p ,6My God in death he was my guide,O’er hell I’ll get the victory.Then up the hill the poor wife wentOpprest with stinking flames and fear,Weeping right sore, with great relent,For to go else she wist not where:J narrow way with thorns and briers,And full of mires was her before ;She sighed oft with sobs and tears.The poor wife’s heart was wond’roussore;Tir’d and torn she went on still,Sometimes she sat and sometimes fell,Aye till she came to a high hill,And then she looked back to hell.When that she had climb’d up the hill,Before her was a goodly plain ;Where she did rest and weep her fill,Then rose and to her feet again.Her heart was glad, the way w-as good,Up to the hill she hied with haste,The flowers were fair where there shestood,The fields.were pleasant to her taste.Then she ^espied Jerusalem,On Zion’s mount where that it stood ;Shining with gold light as the sun,Her silly soul was then right glad :The ports of pearls shining bright,Were very glorious to behold,With precious stones gave such a light,73The walls were of transparent gold,I High were the walls the gates were shut, And long she thought for to be in ;I But then for fear of biding out,She knocked hard and made some din.To knock and cry she did not spare,Till father y4dam did her bear jWho is’t that raps so rudely there,Heaven cannot well be won by weir.The wife of Beith since that you speer,Hath stood these two hours at the gate.Go back quoth he, thou must iorbear,Here may no sinners entrance get.^dam, quoth she, I shall be in,I In spite of all such churls as thee ;ThouTt the original of all sin,J For which thou art not flyting free.I But for thy soul offences fled.y4dam went back and let her be,Looking as if her nose had bled.Then mother Eve did at him speer,Who was it there that made such din ?He said, a woman would be here,!For me I durst not let her in.I’ll go, said he, and ask her will.Her company I would have fain ;But aye she cried and knocked still,i And in no ways she would refrain.Daughter, said Eve, you will do well,To come again another time ;t Heaven is not won by sword or steel,87Nor none that’s guilty of a crime.Mother said she, the fault is thine,That knocking here so long I stand :Thy guilt is more than that of mine,If thou wilt rightly understand,Thou wast the cause of all our sin,Wherein; we were born and conceiv’d,Our misery thou tlkTsfe begin,By thee thy husband was deceiv’dEve went back where Noah was,And told him all how she was blam’d,Of her great sin and Hist trespass.Whereof she was so much asham’d;Then Noah said I will go down,And will forbid her that she knock;Go back, he said, ye drunking lowm,Your none of the celestial flock.Noah she said now hold thy peace,Where I drank alethbu didst drink wineDiscovered was to thy disgrace,When thou wast full like to a swine,If I was drunk I lectm’d at thee,For tijouTt the'father and the first.That others taught and likewise me,To drink when as we had no thirst.Them Noah turned back with speed,And fcokl the pati iarc h Tbra’am then,Ho w that the carl-in"' made him dread,Tnd bow site all his deeds did ken.Abra’am then said, now get you goneLet us no more hear of your din ;9;| No lying wife as I suppose,1 May enter in these gates within. >IOAbra’am, she said will you but spareI 1 hope you are not flyting free;You of vourself had such a care,DenyM your wife and made a lie:Go then I pray you let me be,For I repent of all my sin,Do thou but open the gates to me,And let me quietly come in.Abra’am went back to Jacob then,! And told his grandson how he sped,How that of her nothing he wan,I And that he thought the catling mad.Then down came Jacob thro’ the closeAnd said go backward down to hell:Jacob, quoth she, I know thy voice,That gatv! pertaineth to thysell :Of thy old trumphries I can tell,With two sisters thou led’st thy life.And the thin! part of these tribestwelveThou got with maids beside s thy wife ;And stole thy fathers bennison,Only by fraud thy father fiae;Gave thou not him for venison,A kid insteail of beaken rae ?Jacob himself was tickled so,He went to Lot where he was lying,And to the gate pray’d him to go,To staunch the calling ot her crying.Lot says, fair dame make less ado,10And come again another day.Old harlot carle and drunkard too.Thou with thine own two daughters 1 iyOt thine untimely seed 1 say,Proceeded never good but ill.Poor Lot for thame then stole awayAnd left the wife to knock her till.Meek Moses then went down at last,To pacify the carlin then ;Now dame said he. knock not so fast,Your knocking will not let you ben.Good sir, she said, I am aghast,Whene’er 1 look you in the face ;Jf that your law till now had last,Then surely I had ne’er got grace :But Moses, sii, now, by your leave,Although in heaven you be possest,For all you saw did not believe.But you in Horeb once transgressed,Wherefore by s 11 it is contest.You but got up the land to see,And in the mount were put to rest,Yea buried there where you did die.Moses meekly turned back,And told his brother Aaron there :How the old carlin did so crack,And in no ways did him forbear.Then Aron said, I will not swear,But Pll conjure her as l can ;And 1 will make her now forbear,So that she shall not rap again.13;.nThen Aaron said, you whorish wife,Get you gone and rap no more ;I (With idols you have led your life,)Or then you will repent it sore.Good Aaron priest I know you well,The golden calf you may remember.Who made the people plagues to see.This is of you recorded evere :Your priesthood now is nothing worth,Christ is my only priest, and he,My lord, who shall not keep me forth,So I’ll get in in spite of thee.Up started Sampson at the length,Unto the gate apace came he,To drive away the wife with strength,| But all in vain it would not be.Sampson, quoth she, the world maysee,Thou wast a judge that prov’d unjust;Those gracious gifts which God gavethee,Thou lost by thy licentious lust,! From Delila thy wicked wife,Thy secrets chief couldst not refrain,j She daily sought to take thy life,' Thou lost thy locks and then was slain,Tho’ thou wast strong it was in vain,I Haunted with harlots here and there,Then Sampson turned back again,And with the wife would mell nae mair.Then said king David knock no more,hk.We are all troubled with thy cry.David quoth she, how cam’st thou11 yvKff uoy elofii ilti '? )Thou might’st bide out aswel'l as I,Thy deeds no ways thou canst deny,Is not thy sin far worse than mine?Who with Uriah’s wife did He,And caus’d him to be murder'd syne,Then Jedith said who’s there thatvuo vdn 8f ^And to our neig-bbours g’aVe these hotesMadam said she let be your tnocks,I came not here for cutting throats :I am a sinner full ofblots,Yet through Christ’s blood I shall becleanY1If you anil 1 be judg’d by votes,The thing you did was worse than mine :■ Then said the sapient Solomon,Thou art a sinner all men say,Therefore our Saviour I suppose,Thee heavenly entrance will deny.Mind quoth she thy latter days,What idol gods thou did upset,Tnd wast so lewd in Venus’ plays.Thou didst thy Maker quite forget.Then Jonas said fair dame contentyou,If you intend to come to grace.You must dree penance and repent youEre yoii come within this plate.Ill IftllJona^ quoth she how stands the cas^?f1! flow came you here to be with <’llrist ?1 How dare you look him in the face?I Considering how you broke your tryst,To go God^s errand thou withstood himAnd held his counsel in disdain ;/ The raven messenger thou played him,> And brought no message back again ;With mercy thou wast not cohtent,1 When that the Lord he did them spare;yf{though the city did repent,I It grieved thee thy heart was saif:I Let me alone and speak no more,I Go back again into the whale, fHJI Frtr now my heart is also sore,I But yet I hope 1 shall prevail.Good Jonas said crack on your fill,For here l may no longer tarry,' Yet knock as long as e'er you will,, And go into the firry, tarry.Jonas she says, ye do miscarry,, As I have done in former time,You’re no Saint Peter nor saint Mary,Thy blot’s as black as ever mine.So Jonas then he was asharn’d,i Because he was not flyting free,1 Of all his faults she had him blam’d;I He left the wife and let her be.Saint Thomas then I counsel thee,Go speak unto yon wicked wife,i She shames us all, ftiid as for me,14.Her like I never heard all my life.Thomas then said, you make suchdinWhen you are out, and meikle dinIf you were here, I’ll lay my life,No peace the saints will g'et within :It is your trade for to be flyting,Still in a fever as one raves.No marvel though you wives be biting,Y our tongues are made of aspen leaves.Thomas quoth she, let be your taunts,You play the pick-thank I perceive,Tho’ ye be brother to the saints,An unbelieving heart you have;Thou brought the Lord unto the graveBut would no more with him remain,And wast the last of all the lave,That did believe he rose again.There might no doctrine do thee good,Nor miracles make thee confide,Till thou beheld Christ’s wounds andblood,And put’st thy hands into his side:Didst thou not daily with him bide,And see tlie wonders which he wrought?But blest are they who do confide,And do believe yet saw him not;Thomas, she she says, will you speer,If that my sister Magdalene,Will come to me if she be here ;For comfort sure you give me nane.15He was so blythe he turned back.And thanked God that he was^aue,He had no will to hear her crack,But told it Mary Magdalene.When that she heard hersister’s mocksShe went unto the gate with speed ;And asked her who’sthei e that knocks 3’Tis I the wife of Beith indeed,i She said good mistress you must stand,I Till ye be tried by tribulation.Sister, quoth she, give me your hand,1 Are we not both of one vocation ?It is not through your occupation,! That you are placed so divine.5 My faith is fixed on Christ’s passion,I' My soul shall be as safe as thine.Then Mary went away in haste,l the carlin made her so ashamed,{ She had no will of such a guest,To lose her pains and be so blamed.Now good St Paul said Magdalene,! Because you are a learned man,ffl Go and convince this woman then,iFor 1 have done all that I can :Sure if she were in bell I doubt,They would not keep her longer there,But to the gate would turn her out;And send her back to be elsewhere.Then went the good apostle Paul,To put the wife in better tune,f Wash off that filth that fyles thy soul,16Then shall heav’n’s gates be open soon.Remember Paul what thou hast done,For all th’ epistles thou didst compile,Though now thou sittest up above,Thou persecuted Christ a while.Woman be said, thou art not right,That which I did, I did not know ;But thou did sin with all thy might,Although the preachers did thee show.Saint Paul, she said, it is not so,I did not know as well as ye,But 1 will to my Saviour go,Who will his favour show to me ;You think you are of flyting free,Because you were wrapt up above,But yet it was Christ’s grace to thee,And matchlessness of his dear love.Then, Paul, she says let Peter come,If he be lying let him rise,To him 1 will confess my sin,And let him quickly bring the keys,Too long I stand he'll let me in,For why 1 cannot longer tarry,Then shall ye all be quit of din,For 1 must speak w ith good Saint Mary.The good apostle discontent,Right suddenly he turned back,For he did very much repent,To hear the carling proudly Crack.Paul says good brother now arise,And make an end of all this din :*TAmi if be so you have the keys,1 Open and let the calling in ;'lIThe apostle Peter arose at last,And to the gate with speed he hies,Carling quoth he knock not so fastiYou cumber Mary with your cries.Peter, she said let Christ arise,And grnat me mercy in my need ;i For why I ne’er deny’d him thrice,■As though thyself hast done indeed.1 Thou cal ling bold what’s that to thee.',1 got remission for my sin ;; It cost many sad tears to me,| Before 1 entered heie within ;i It will not be thy meikle din,iiWill cause heav’n’s gates opened be,IThou must be purified of sin,//nd of all sins must be made free.Saint Peter then no thanks io you,f That so you were rid of your fears,l It was Christ’s.gracious look 1 trow,I That made you weep those bitter tears,IThe door of mercy is not clos'd,I may get grace as well as ye,It is not so as ye suppos'd1 will be in, in spite of thee.But wicked wife it is too late,Thou shouldeal have mourn'd uponearth,Repentance now is out of date ;1 It should have been before thy death ;18Thou mightest then have turned wrathTo mercy then and mercy great,But now the Lord is very loth,And all thy cries not worth a jot.Ah ! Petei then what shall I do?He will not hear me as 1 hear,Shall 1 despair of mercy too !No no I’ll trust in mercy dear:And if I perish here I’ll stay,And never go from heaven bright ;I’ll ever hope and always pray,Until I get my Saviour’s sight.1 think indeed you now are right,If you had faith you could win in :Importune then with all your might,Faith is the feet wherewith ye come .It is the hands will hold him fast,But weak faith never may presume;’ 1 will let you sink, and be agbast.Strongly believe or you’re undone.But good Saint Peter, let me be,Had you such faith did it abound ?When you did walk upon the sea,Were ye not likely to be drown’d ?Had not our Saviour helped thee,Who came and took thee by the hand :So can my Lord do unto me,And bring me to the promis’d land,Is my faith weak? Yet he is stillThe same and ever shall remain ;His mercies last and his good will,3;_i . .19To bring me to his flock again;(He will me help and me relieve,And will increase rny faith also,Ilf weakly I can but believe,For from this place I ’ll never go.But Peter said how can that be?How dar’st thou look him in the face?ISuch horrid sinners like to thee,; Can have no courage to have giace:Here none comes in but they that'sstout,!And suffer'd have for the good cause;Like unto thee are keeped out,For thou hast broken all Moses* laws.Peter she said I do appeal.From Moses and from thee also ;I1!With him and you I'll not prevail,I But to my Saviour I will #0 :Indeed of old you were right stout,When you did cut off Malchus' ear;But after that you went about,And a poor maid then did you fear.Wherefore Saint Peter do forbear,A comforter indeed you're not;Let me alone I do not fear,Take home the wissel of your groat:I Was it your own or Paul's good sword.When that your courage was so keen,You were right stout up in my word,Then you would fain at fishing been ;[ For ere the crowing of the cock,mYou did deny your master thrice;, 1For all yV)ur stoutness turn’d a block,Now flyte no more if ye be wi&$¥/ hu^lYet at the last the Lord arose,Environed with angels bright, ,/} i0'»£|And to the wife in haste he goes,Desir’d her to pass out of sight.() Lord quoth she, cause me do: right*Hut not according to my sin ;Have you not promis’d day and night,When sinners knock to let them in ?He said thou wrests the scriptureswrong,. >;;i • ,i mail adiJ IThe night is come thou spent the day,In whoredom, thou hast, lived long,And to repent thou didst delay ;Still my commandments thou abus’dAnd vice commited’st busily,Since now my mercy thou refus’d’stGo down to hell eternally,. jO Lord, my soul doth testify.That 1 have spent my life, in vain ; ,Ah !

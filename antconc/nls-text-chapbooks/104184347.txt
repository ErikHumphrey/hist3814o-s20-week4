After a jfmart little amongtherafelves, they divided, and ’tis laid, the party whogained this Bucky-battle, fearing the Englifli law totake place, fet forward and took up their refidence atthis Buckhaven, fo called, not only from the greatquantity «f backies that are foand in and about thatplace, but on account of the battle they had withtheir neighboursat Berwick whe» they divided,whichwas then called bucking ®ne another, but it is nownamed boxing or fighting* Another party of thefeBuckets fettled in another town, northward toBanff, called Bucky near the river Spey, which is &large fea town, but among ail the fea towns in Scot¬land, the fifilers dill retain a language quite differ¬ent from the people in the country, and they almoftall mifs the letter H, and ufe O inftead thereof,which no conntry people do la Scotland but then**felves.

John did speir.Says Thrummy, sure ye needna care.I’ll gae and try to get some mair,Sae down the stair again he goes.To get o’ drink anither dose.Being positive to hae some mair;But still he fand the Ghaist was there.Now on a hutt behind the door:Says he, ye didna ill beforaDear brother Thrummy, sae I’ll tryYou ance again, because I’m dry.He fills his jug stright out below.An’ up the stair again dees go.10John marrelled sair, but didna spurAgain where he did get the beer.For it was stronger than the first,Sae they baith drank till like to burst.Syne did compose themsels to rest,To sleep a while they thought it best.An hour in bed they hadna been.And scarcely weel had clos’d their e en,Whan just into the neighbouring chain'er,They heard a dreadfu’ din and clamour.Beneath thebed-claes John did cow’r.But Thrummy jumpt upon the floor.Him by the sark-tail John did baud ;Lye still, quoth he, fat, are ye mad ?Thrummy then gaed a hasty jump.And took John on the ribs a thump.Till on the bed he tumbled down.In little better than a swoon.While Thrummy fast as he could rin.Set afF to see what made the din.The chamber seem’d to him as light.As gif the sun were shining bright;The Ghaist was stanen at the door.In the same dress he had afore ;Wd o’er anent it, at the wa’.Were ither apparitions twa.Thrummy beheld them for a-wee.But deil a word as yet spake he:The spirits seem’d to kick a ba’.The Ghaist against the other twa;Whilk close they drave baith back and fore,A tween the chimney and the door.He stops a while and sees the play,'syne, rinnin up, he this did say,11Ane for an* may wed compare.But twa for ane is rather sair;The play’s nae equal, say I vow.Dear brother Thrummy, I’ll help yon.Then wi' his fit he kicked the ha’,Gard it play slot against the \va’;Quick then, as lightning frae the sky,The spectres with a horrid cry,A’ vanished in a clap o’ thun’er.While Thrummy at the same did won’er.The room was quiet now and dark.An’ Thrummy striping in his sark;Glauming the gate back to his bed,I He thinks he hears a parson tread.An’ ere he gat without the door.The Ghaist again stood him before.And in his face did staring stand,Wi’ a big candle in its hand.! Quoth Thrummy, Friend, I want to knowWhat brings you frae the shades below,I in my Maker’s name commandYou tell your story just aff hand ?Fat wad ye hae ?—I’ll do my bestFor you, to let you be at restThen says the Ghaist, ’ Tis thirty years,Since I’ve been doom d to wander here;In all that time there has been noneBehav’d sae bold as ye have done:Sae if you’ll do a job for me.Disturbance mair I’ll never gie.! Sae on your tale, quoth ThrummyTo do you justice sure will try.Then mark me weel, the Ghaist repliedAnd ye shall soon be satisfied;12Free this aback near forty year,I of this place was overseer.When this Laird’s father had the land*A’ thing was then at my command,Wi’ power to do as I thought fit.In ilka cause I chief did sit:The Laird paid great respect for me.But I an ill return did gie;The Title-Deeds of his "EstateOut of the same I did him cheat,And stale them frae whare they did lie,Some days before the Laird did die.His son at that time was in France,And sae I thought I’d hae a chanceGif he sud never come again.That the Estate would he my ain.But scarcely three hare weeks were past.When death did come and grip me fast,Sae sudden that I hadna pow'rThe charter hack for to restore.Soon after that hame came the heir.And syne got up the reefu’ rair.What sorrow was come o’ the Rights PThey sought them several days and nightsBut never yet hae they been seen.As I aneath a muckle stane.Did hide them i’ this charmer wa’,VVeel sew’d up in a leather ha’;But I was ne’er allow’d to restUntil that I the same confest;But this to do I hadna power,Frae yon time to this verra hour.That I’ve reveal’d it a’ to you;And now I’ll tell you w^at to do.T1U nae langsyne nae mony kent.That this same Laird the Rights did wantiBut now they hae him at the law.And the neist owk the Laird maun shaw,Afore the court, the Rights o’s land.This puts him to an unco stand:For if he dinna shaw them there,O’ a’ his lands he’ll be stript bare ;Nae hopes has he to save his ’state.This maks him sour and unco blate :He canna think whar’s Rights may b*.And ne’er expects them mair to see.But now, my friend, mark what I tell*And ye’ll get something to yoursel.Tak out the stane there in the wa’.And there ye’ll get the leather ba’,Tis just the same that you did see.When you said that you would help me;The Rights are sew’d up in its heart.But see you dinna wi’ them part.Until the laird shall pay you downJust fifty guineas and a crown,Whilk at my death was due to me.This for thy trouble I’ll give thee;And I’ll disturb this house nae mair,’Cause I’ll be free from all my care.This Thrummy promised to do,And syne the Ghaist bid him adieuAnd vanish’d with a pleasant soundDown thro’ the laft and thro’ the ground.Thrummy gaed back syne to his bed,And cowardly John was verra glad.That he his neighbour saw ance mair.For of his life he did despair.14Wow man, ** John, whare hae y6*i baw,Come tell me a ye hae seen.Na, hide, says Thrnmmy, till day-light,And syne I’ll tell you hale and right.Sae haith lay still and took a nap.Until the ninth hour it did chap.Thrummy syne raise, put on his clues.And to the chamber quick he gaes,Taks out the stane into the wa’,And soon he found the leathern ha’;Took out the Rights, replac’d the stane.Ere John did ken whar he had been :Then baith came stopping down the stair.The morning now was calm and fair.Weel, says the Laird, my trusty frien’,Hae ye ought in our chamber seen ?Quoth Thrummy, Sir, I naething sawThat did me ony ill ava.Weel, quoth the Laird, ye now may gang.Ye ken the day’s na verra lang;In the mean time its calm and clear.Ye lose your time in biding here.Quoth Thrummy, Sir, mind what I tell,I’ve mair right here than you yoursel.Sae till I like I here shall bide.The Laird at this began to chide:Says he. My friend, you’re turning rude.Quoth Thrummy, I’ll my claim make good.For here I just before you a’,The Rights o’ this Estate can shaw,And that is mair then ye can do.What! quo’ the Laird, can that he true ?’Tis true, quoth Thrummy, look and fee.D’ye think that I would tell a lie.15Parchments frae his pouch then drew,And down upon the table threw.The Laird at this up to him ran.And cried, Whar did you get them, man ?Syne Thrummy tald him a’ the tale.As I’ve tald you, haith clear and hale.The Laird at this was fidgin fain.That he had gat his Rights again :And fifty guineas down did tell,Besides a present frae himsel.Thrummy thanked him, an’ syne his gowdIntil a muckle purse he stow’d,And cramm’d it in his oxter-pouch.And syne sought out his aiken crutch :And, fare-ye-weel, I maun awa.And see gin I get thro’ the sna’;Weel, fare-ye-weel, replied the Laird:But how comes it ye hanna’ shar’dOr gien your neibor o’ the money ?Na, by my saul, I Sir, quo’ Thruromy,When I the siller. Sir, did win,(To ha’e done this wad be a sin,)Before that I the Ghaist had laid.The nasty beast had the bed.And sae my tale I here do end,1 hope no one it will offend:My muse will na assist me langer.The dorty jade sometimes does anger,I thought her ance a gay smart lass.But now she’s come to sic • pass.That a’ my cudgeling and wheeping.Will hardly wake her out o’ sleeping ;To plague her mair I winna try,But dight my pen and lay it by.■MTHECOMIC TALEorMARGARET and the MINISTER.That liv’d a quiet contented life,To show respect unto the priest.Whom she esteem’d within her breast,Catch’d twa fat hens, baith big an’ plumpAn’ butter she pack’d up a lump.Which she a present meant to gi’e him,And wi’ them aff she gaed to see him.Dress’d in her ain auld kintry fas’on,Wi’ brown stuff gown, an’ braw white bussiti.A dark blue cloak an’ hood co’er’d a’,Sae lade, sae clad, she march’d awa ;Thus trudg’d alang—an’ hence belyve,At the manse door she did arrive—Rapp’t, was admitted by the maid;Ben to the kitchen wi’ her gade—Syne for the Minister inquir’d.Who soon came butt, as she desir’d,When she to him a curtchie made.An’ he to her thus smiling said.A douse, religious, kintry wife,Min.

she mourn’d her Jove not true,And wept I er cares away.The brook flow’d gently at herIn murmurs smooth along;Her pipe, which once she tun’d so sweet.Had now forgot its song.No more to charm the vale sire tries,For grief has fill’d her breast;Fled are the joys she us’d to prize,And fled with them her rest.Poor hepless maid ! who can beholdThy anguish so severe,Or hear thy love-lorn story told,Without a pitying tear !Maria, hapless maid, adieu !Thy sorrows soon must cease;Seen heaven will take a maid so trueTo everlasting peace.*Gi Yffl :»r^. • " !*FINIS.

Ai)—“ Humours of Glen."How early I woo’d thee—how dearly I lo’ed thee—How sweet was thy voice, and how lovely thy smile 5The joy ’twas to see thee—the bliss to be wi’ thee—I now maun remember, and sigh all the while.I gazed on thy beauty, and a’ things about yeSeem’d too fair for earth, as I bent at thy shrine;But fortune and fashion, mair powerfu’ than passion,Could alter the bosom that seem’d so divine.Anither may praise thee, may fondle and fraize thee,And win thee wi’ words when his heart’s far awa’;But oh ! when sincerest—when warmest and dearestHis vows, will my truth be forgot by thee a’ ?’.Mid pleasures and splendour thy fancy may wander,But moments o’ solitude ilk ane maun dree ;Then feeling will find thee, and mem’ry remind theeO’ him wha through life gaes heart-broken for thee.:THE SPINNING-WHEEL.Key-note F.As I sat at my spinning-wheel,A bonnio laddie he pass’d by;I turned me round and viewed him weel.For oh 1 he had a glancing e’e.My panting heart began to feel,But aye I turned my spinning-wheel.My snow-white hands he did extol.He praised my fingers neat and small,He said there was nae lady fair,That ance wi’ me he could compare.His words into my heart did steal,But aye I turned my spinning-wheel.He said, Lay bye your rock, your reel,Y'our windings, and your spinning-wheelHe bade me lay them a’ aside,And come and be his bonnie bride.And oh 1 I liked his words sae weel,I laid aside my spinning-wheel.CONNLL AND FLORA.Words by At,ex. Wilson. Music arrangid by J. Robertson 'Dark lowers the night o’er the wide stormy main.Till mild rosy morning rise cheerful again ;Alas ! morn returns to revisit the shore,But Connel returns to his Flora no more.133For see, on yon mountain, the dark cloud of death.O’er Connel’s lone cottage, lies low on the heath;While bloody and pale, on a far distant shore,He lies to return to his Flora no more.Ye light fleeting spirits that glide o’er the steep,O would you but waft me across the wild deep !There fearless I’d mix in the battle’s loud roar,I’d die with my Connel, and leave him no more. -OSes TULLOCHGORU.M.H'ords by the Rev.

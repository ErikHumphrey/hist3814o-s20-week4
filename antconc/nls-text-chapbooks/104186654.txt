RlNDALfc.]\  THECoalman's CourtshipTO THECREEL-WIFE’S DAUGHTER.PART r.ALL you that are curious of Courtfhip,give attention to the hiftory of Maryand her fon Sawny, a young Coalman,who lived in th? country, a few miles fromEdinburgh.Mary his mither, was a gay heaity wife;had mair wantonnefs nor wealth; was twelveyears a married wife, nine years a widow,and was very chafte in her behaviour, wi*her ain tale, for want o’ chargin'; for a’ thetime o' her widowhood there was never aman got a ki!$ o* her lips, nor laid a foulhand on her hind quarters.Sawny. her fon, was a ftout young rawloon, full fac’d, wi’ flabby cheeks, duddy3breeks, and a ragget doublet; gade alwayswi’ his bofom bare, lometiines had ae g^rtan,a lingel or ftrae rape was gude enough forSawny. His very belly was a' fun-burnt,like a piper’s bag, or the head of an aulddrum, and yet his beard began to Iprout outlike herring banes. He took thick brole tohis breakfall;, and baps and ale thro’ the day,and when the coals fell’d dear, and he win’wax cauld, bought an ovendarl, and twaDumbar Wadders, or a Glair ow Magiftratewhich fifh-wives ca’ a Waflen herrin’.H;s mither, auld Mary, plagued h:m ay inthe morning*, fhe got up when the benskeckled, ringed the ribs, blew her fnotter-box, primed her nofe, kindled her tobacco'1pipe, and at every puff breathed out fret¬ting againft her hard fortune, and hneiyCngle life. O but a widow be a poor name,but I live in a wildernefs in this lang-lonea;mony a man gaes by my door, but few folkslooks in to poor Mary! Hoch hey, will Inever win out o' this wearied life. Wa Saw¬ny, man, wilt thcu na rife the day; thefun’s up, and a* the nibours round about;Willie and Charlie is on the hill an hourIiyne, and half gate ha me again. Wilt thcurife an' gi’e the beafts a bite •, thou minds na’them l wat man. Grump, Grump, quo aw-ny, they got their fupper an hour after I got| mine. Shut to dpad come on them every4-sme, an* they get z bit frae me till theywork for’t.Sa^vny. But mither, I‘ve been drepmin’. that I was married, an’ in the bed aboonthe bride; I wonder gin it be true ? Od, Ine'er got fic fun ; what wil’t be, think ye ?How auld am I, mither? Do ye think Icould man a hifly yet ? fegs I’ve a mindto try; but the faucy hiflies will na haeme, I ken weel enough.Mither. Say you lad; ay mony a hungryheart wad be blythe o’ you ; but there wasnever a fca'd Jockey btit there was a fcab-bed Jenny till him yet: dinna be fear'd lad.Sawny. A hech, mither, I‘fe no belordly, an* I fud tak a beggar wife aft thehi1 gate ; but I’il tell ye fomething thatI‘m aye thinking on, but ye maun na tellthe n ighbours, for the chields wad ayejamf me wi‘t.Mither. Wad I tell o' thee, lad I wadtell o' myfel as foon.Sawny. Do ye mind, mither, that dayI gade to the Fans, I came in by ardd Mat¬tie’s, your countryman's, the Fife wife, itcam* out o, the town ye came frae; the wifethat fays Be-go laddie: I gade there, an fhewas nae in, and the daughter kend me: fhewas unco kind, and made me fat brofe outo‘ the lee fide o' her kail-pot: there wasbaith btef and paunches in‘t; od they fmel dlike ony haggis, and fhined a' like a gou'd5facc’d waiftcoit: fegs I fuppit till I w;* liketo rive o’ them, and had a rift o' them themorn a’ day; when 1 came out I had z kitelike a cow wi calf; fne fpkr’d for you, m'-ther, and I faid yc was gaily; and fiie look¬ed to me and leugh and gripped my fha-kele-bane and faid I wad be a fturd? faf-low yet—I looked to her, and thojght Iliked her, and think* on’t aye lince fjnt;fhe leugh, and bade me feek out a coal dii-ver for her, for {he diina like to carry afilh creel.Mither. Forfooth, lawny, I’ll gie my twalug* for a lav’rockh egg if flae b nna in lovewi7 thee, and that will be a bargain.Sawny. An' upon ruy word mither, fije'sa fturdy gimmer, well worth the ftnoakingafter ; {he has a dimple on every rheek an'ane on her chin, twa l?gs like twa polls an*haunches like a fodjer’s lady’s hoop ; theyhobble when Ihe llaake , and her paps playniddety nod when file gangs.

Q happydeliverance, cried Mary bis mither: thoughdirt bodes luck and foul farts file the blank¬ets, I with ne<er v aur be amang us. Thenext thing thaudid jawny good, was threemutchkins of milk made into thin brofe,and a pickle fine pepper in them ; yet he hada fongbing in h s lugs like a faw-mill, andevery thing gade round about wi' him a*that day : his mither gat him out cf bed, an’puc him in the muckte chair, wi* a peir ofblankets about h; fhouUkrs, a cod at, hisback, and a he ick to his foks, to garhim trow hens nae well. mid there he fatlike a lying-in wife, cracking like a Hoi-16Udder, and ate twa dead herrins and a crufl-,telling a‘ the outs and ins about the bridal,and when it was to be ; for he had gottenevery body‘3 confent but the bride's about it.Mit her. But Sawny man, that s themain thing; ye maun hae that too.Sawny. Na na, mither, I'm the mainthing myfclf, and flie‘s but a member ; themen maun aye be foremoft—gang whatway it wilh I‘fe be aye the uppermoft.Mither.

Ha, ha, mither, the poor fouh'slike the lice, ay when they meet they mar¬ry, and maks mae, o( them : and I thinkthe rpinifters might chriften their bits o’weans for naething, the water's no fa;fcant: they are weel paid for their preach¬ing, they may rery welt baith marry andchriften a' the poor fouks into the bargain,by the way of a maggs.Mither. Ay, ay, my man Sawny, mar¬riage is a fweet th;ng for young fouk antithe bed undefiled.Sawny.

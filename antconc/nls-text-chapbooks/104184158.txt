warbling bird,That wantons thro’ the flow’ring thorn,Thou minds me o’ departed joys,Beparted never to return.Oft hae I roved by bonny Boon,To see the rose and woodbine twine;And ilka bird sang o’ its love,And fondly say did I o’ mine.Wi’ lightsome heart I pu’d a rose,Fu’ sweet upon its thorny tree;And my fauce lover stole my rose,But ah ! he left the thorn wi’ me.GREEN GROW THE RASHES, O.There’s

to pree ;Three blither hearts that lee-lang nightYe wadna’ find in Christendie.We are nx fou, we’re nae that fou,But jist a drappie in our e’e.The cock may craw, the day may daw,An’ aye we’ll taste the barley bree.6Here are we met, three merry boys,Three merry boys I trow are we,And mony a night we’ve merry been,And mony may we hope to be !It is the moon, I ken her horn,That’s blinkin’ in the lift sae hie;She shines sae bright to while us hame;But by my sooth she’ll wait a wee!Wha first shall rise to gang awa’,A cuckold, coward loun is he;Wha last beside his chair shall fa’,He is the king amang us three!AMANG THE RIGS O’ BARLEY.It was upon a Lammas night,When corn-rigs are bonnie,Beneath the moon’s unclouded light,I held awa’ to Annie :The time flew by wi’ tentless heed,Till ’tween the late and early,Wi’ sma’ persuasion she agreedTo see me throught the barley.Corn rigs, and barley rigs,An’ corn rigs are bonnie,I’ll ne’er forget that happy night,Amang the rigs o’ barley.The sky was blue, the wind was still,The moon was shining clearly,I set her down with wi’ right good-willAmang the rigs o’ barley.7I kent her heart was a’ my ain;I lo’ed her most sincerly,I kissed and kissed her o’er again,Amang the rigs o’ barley.I locked her in my fond embrace;Her heart was beating rarely;My blessings on that happy placeAmang the rigs o’ barley.But by the moon and stars sae bright,That shone that hour sae clearly ;She aye shall bless that happy night,Amang the rigs o’ barley.SCOTS WHA HAE.Scots, wha hae wi’ Wallace bled,Scots, wham Bruce has often led,Welcome to your gory bed,Or to victory!Now’s the day, and now’s the hour 1See the front of battle lour !See approach proud Edward’s pow’r,Chains and slavery 1Wha wrad be a traitor knave ?Wha wad fill a coward’s grave ?Wha sae base as be a slave ?Let him turn and flee !Wha for Scotland’s king and law,Freedom’s sword will strongly draw?Freeman stand, or freeman fa’,Let him follow me.8By Oppression’s woes and pains !By your sons in servile chains !We will drain our dearest veins,But they shall be free.Lay the proud usurpers low !Tyrants fall in every foe !Liberty’s in every blow!Let us do or die.HIGHLAND MARY.Ye banks, and braes, and streams aroundThe Castle o’ Montgomery,Green be your woods and fair your flowers,Your waters never drumlie.There Simmer first unfaulds her robes,And there the langest tarry ;And there I took the last farewellOf my sweet Highland Mary.How sweetly bloom’d the gray green birk,How rich the hawthorn’s blossom,As underneath their fragrant shadeI clasp’d her to my bosom !The golden hours on angel wingsFlew o’er me and my dearie—For dear to me as light and life,Was my dear Highland Mary.Wi’ monie a vow and lock’d embraceOur parting was fu’ tender,And pledging aft to meet again,We tore ourselves asunder.9But oh ! fell Death’s untimely frostThat nipt my flower so early;Now green’s the sod, and cauld’s the clayThat wraps my Highland Mary.O pale, pale now those rosy lips,I aft hae kiss’d sae fondly;And clos’d, for aye, the sparkling glanceThat dwelt on me sae kindly.And mouldering now in silent dust,The heart that loe’d me dearly;But still, within my bosom’s core,Shall live my Highland Mary.JOHN ANDERSON, MY JO.John Anderson, my jo, John,When we were first acquaint,Your locks were like the raven,Your bonnie brow was brent;But now your brow is bauld, John,Your locks are like the snaw,But blessings on your frosty pow,John Anderson, my jo.John Anderson, my jo, John,We clamb the hill thegither;And mony a canty day, John,We’ve had wi’ ane anither.Now, we maun totter down, John,But hand in hand we’ll go,And sleep thegither at the foot,John Anderson, my jo.IOTHE BIRKS OF ABERFELDY.Now, Simmer blinks on flow’ry braes,And o’er the crystal streamlet plays,Come, let us spend the lightsome daysIn the birks of Aberfeldy.Bonnie lassie will ye go,Will ye go, will ye go,Bonnie lassie will ye goTo the birks of Aberfeldy ?While o’er their heeds the hazels hing,The little birdies blithely sing,Or lightly flit on wanton wing,In the birks of Aberfeldy.The braes ascend like lo ty wa’s,The foaming stream deep roaring fa’s,O’er hung wi’ fragrant spreading shaws,The birks of Aberfeldy.The hoary cliffs are crowned wi’ flowers,White o’er the linns the burnie pours,And rising weets wi’ misty showersThe birks of Aberfeldy.Let Fortune’s gifts at random flee,They ne’er shall draw a wish from me,I’m homely blest wi’ love and thee,To the birks of Aberfeldy.GLOOMY WINTER’S NOW AWA’.Gloomy winter’s now awa’,Saft the western breezes blaw;’Mang the birks of Stanley shawThe mavis sings fu’ cheerie, O.IISweet the crow-flower’s early bellDecks Gleniffer’s dewy dell,Blooming like thy bonny sel’,My young, my artless dearie, O.Come, my lassie, let us strayO’er Glenkilloch’s sunnie brae,Blythely spend the gowden day’Midst joys that never weary, O.Towering o’er the Newton woods,Lavrocks fan the snaw-white clouds,Siller saughs wi’ downy budsAdorn the banks sae briery, O.Round the sylvan fairy nooks,Feath’ry brackens fringe the rocks,’Neath the brae the burnie jouks,And ilka thing is cheerie, O.Trees may bud, and birds may sing,Flowers may bloom, and verdure spring,Joy to me they canna’ bring,Unless wi’ thee my dearie, O.NAE LUCK ABOUT THE HOUSE.And are ye sure the news is true ?And are ye sure he’s weel ?Is this a time to talk o’ wark ?Mak’ haste, set by your wheel.Is this a time to talk o’ wark;When Colin’s at the door ?Gie me my cloak, I’ll to the quay,And see him safe ashore.12For there’s nae luck aboot the house,There’s nae luck ava;There’s little pleasure in the houseWhen our gudeman’s awa’.Rise up and make a clean fire-side,Put on the muckle pat;Gie little Kate her cotton gown,And Jock his Sunday’s hat;And mak’ their shoon as black as slaes,Their hose as white as snaw,It’s a’ to please my ain gudeman,He likes to see them braw.There are twa hens upon the bankBeen fed this month and mair,Mak’ haste and thraw their necks aboutThat Colin weel may fare.And spread the table neat and clean,Gar ilka thing look braw,It’s a’ to pleasure our gudeman,For he’s been lang awa’.Come gi’e me down my bigonets,My bishop-satin gown,And rin and tell the Bailie’s wifeThat Colin’s come to town.My Sunday shoon they maun go on,My hose o’ pearl blue,It’s a’ to please my ain gudeman,For he’s baith leal and true.Sae true his words, sae smooth his speech,His breath like caller air!His very foot has music in’t\yhen he comes up the stair^t13And will I see his face again ?And will I hear him speak ?I’m downright dizzy wi’ the thought,In troth I’m like to greet.The cauld blasts o’ the winter wind,That thrilled through my heart,They’re a’ blawn by; I ha’e him safe,Till death we’ll never part.But wha puts parting in my mind,It may be far awa’,The present moment is our ain,The neist we never saw.Since Colin’s weel, I’m weel content,I ha’e nae mair to crave ;Could I but live to make him blest,I’m blest aboon the lave.And will I see his face again ?And will I hear him speak ?I’m downright dizzy wi’ the thought,In troth I’m like to greet.AND SAE WILL WE YET.Sit ye down, my cronies, and gi’e me your crack,Let the win’ take the care o’ this life on its back,Our hearts to despondency we never will submitFor we’ve aye been provided for, and sae will* we yet.Let the miser delight in the hoarding of peh,Since he has not the saul to enjoy it himself;Since the bounty of Providence is new ev’ry day,As we journey through life, let us live by the way.14Then bring us a tankard of nappy good ale,For to comfort our hearts, and enliven oursel’s,We’ll aye be provided for the langer we sit,For we’ve drank thegither monie a time, and saewill we yet.Success to the farmer, and prosper his store,Rewan ing his eident toils a’ the year o’er,Our seeu uine and harvest we ever will get,For we’ve lippen’d aye to Providence, and saewill we yet.Long live the king, and happy may he be,And success to his forces by land and by sea,His enemies to triumph we ne’er will permit,Britons aye ha’e been victorious, and sae willwe yet.Let the glass keep its course, an’ go merrily roun’,For thj sun has to rise tho’ the moon it go doon,Till the house be rinnin’ round about there’s timeenough to flit,When we fell, we aye got up again, and sae willwe yet.THE HIGHLAND PLAIDLowland lassie, wilt thou go,Where the hills are clad wi’ snow;Where, beneath the icy steep,The hardy shepherd tends his sheep,111 nor wae shall the betide,When row’d with my Highland plaid.i5Soon the voice of cheery Spring*Will gar a’ our plantings ring;Soon our bonny heather braes,Will put on their Simmer claes,On the mountain’s sunny side,We’ll lean us on my Highland plaid.When the simmer spreads the flow’rs,Busks the glen in leafty bow’rs,Then we’ll seek the caller shade,Lean us on the primrose bed;While the burning hours preside,I’ll screen thee wi’ my Highland plaid.; Then we’ll leave the sheep and goat,I will launch the bonny boat,[ Skim the loch wi’ canty glee,j Rest the oars to pleasure thee !When chilly breezes sweep the tide,I’ll hap thee wi’ my Highland plaid.Lowland lads may dress mair fine,Woo in words mair saft than mine;Lowland lads hae mair of art,An’ may boast an honest heart;Whilk shall ever be my pride;O, row thee in my Highland plaid.Bonny lad, ye’ve been sae leal,My heart would break at our farewell,Lang your love has made me fain,Take me, take me for your ain,’Cross the Firth, away then glide,Young Donald and his Lowland bride.i6OH! NANNY, WILT THOU GANG WI ME.Oh ! Nanny, wilt thou gang wi me ?Nor sigh to leave the flaunting town;Can silent glens have charms for thee,The lowly cot, and russet gown ?No longer drest in silk and sheen,No longer deck’d with jewels rare,Say, canst thou quit the busy scene,Where thou art fairest of the fair ?Oh ! Nanny, when thou’rt far away,Wilt thou not cast a wish behind ?Say, canst thou face the parching ray,Nor shrink before a wintry wind ?Oh ! can that soft, that gentle mien,Extremes of hardships learn to bear,Nor sad regret each courtly scene,Where thou art fairest of the fair ?Oh! Nanny, canst thou love so true,Through perils keen with me to go;Or when thy swain mishap shall rue,To share with him the pang of woe?Say, should disease or pain befall,Wilt thou assume the nurses care,Nor wistful those gay scenes recall,Where thou wert fairest of the fair ?Oh ! Nanny, when thy love shall die,Wilt thou receive his parting breath ?Wilt thou repress each struggling sigh,And cheer with smiles the bed of death ?i7And wilt thou o’er his breathless clayStrew flowers, and drop the tender tear,Nor then regret those scenes so gay,Where thou wert fairest of the fair ?THE EWIE WF THE CROOKED HORN.0 were I able to rehearse,My ewie’s praise in proper verse,I’d blaw it out as loud and fierce,As ever piper’s drone could blaw.The ewie wi’ the crooked horn,Weel deserved baith grass and corn,Sic a ewie ne’er was born,Here about, nor far awa’.1 neither needed tar nor keel,To mark upo’ her hip or heel;Her crooked horn it did as weel,To ken her by amo’ them a’.A better, nor a thriftier beast,Nae honest man cou’d weel hae wist,For, silly thing, she never mistTo hae ilk year a lamb or twa.The first she had I ga’e to Jock,To be to him a kind of stock,And now the laddie has a flock,O’ mair than thirty head to ca\The neist I ga’e to Jean, and nooThe bairn’s sae bra’, has fauld sae fu’,That lads sae thick come her to woo,They’re fain to sleep on hay or straw.i8Yet for Monday last, for a’ my keeping,I canna’ speak it without greeting,A villain came, when I was sleeping,An’ staw my ewie, horn an a’.I sought her sair upon the morn,And down beneath a buss o’ thorn,I got my ewie’s crooked horn ;But, ah ! my ewie was awa’.But gin I had the loon that did it.I’ve sworn and ban’d as well as said it,Tho’ a the world should forbid it,I wad gie his neck a thraw.O had she died o’ croop or cauld,As ewies die when they are auld,It wad na’ been, by many fauld,Sae sair a heart to nane o’s a’.For a’ the claith that we ha’e worn,Frae her and hers, sae aften shorn,The loss o’ her we could hae born,Had fair strae death ta’en her awa’.But this poor thing to loose her life,Aneath a greedy villain’s knife,I’m really fear’d that our gudewifeS’all never win aboon’t ava’.KELVIN GROVE.Let us haste to Kelvin Grove, bonnie lassie, O,Through its mazes let us rove, bonnie lassie, OWhere the rose in all its prideDecks the hollow dingle’s side,Where the midnight fairies glide, bonnie lassie, O.>9We will wander by the mill, bonnie lassie, O,To the cove beside the rill, bonnie lassie, O,Where the glens rebound the callOf the lofty waterfall,Thro’ the mountain’s rocky hall, bonnie lassie, O.Then we’ll up to yonder glade, bonnie lassie, O,Where so oft beneath its shade, bonnie lassie, O,With the songster in the grove,We have told our tale of love,And have sportive garlands wove, bonnie lassie, O.Ah ! I soon must bid adieu, bonnie lassie, O,To this fairy scene and you, bonnie lassie, O,To the streamlet winding clear,To the fragrant scented brier,E’en to thee, of all most dear, bonnie lassie, O.For the frowns of fortune low’r, bonnie lassie, O,On thy lover at this hour, bonnie lassie, O,Ere the golden orb of day,Wake the warblers from the spray,From this land I must away, bonnie lassie, O.And when on a distant shore, bonnie lassie, O,Should I fall ’midst battle’s roar, bonnie lassie, O,Will you Helen, when you hear,Of your lover on his bier,To his memory shed a tear, bonnie lassie, O ?AULD ROBIN GRAY.When the sheep are in the fauld, and the kye athame,And a’ the world to sleep are gane;The waes o’ my heart fa’ in showers frae my e’e,While my gudeman lies sound by me.20Young Jamie lo’ed me wee! and he sought mefor his bride ;But saving a crown he had naething beside !To mak’ the crown a pound, my Jamie gaed to sea;And the crown and the pound were baith for me.He hadna’ been gane a week but only twa,When my father brake his arm, and our cow wasstown awa’,My mother she fell sick, and my Jamie at the sea,And auld Robin Gray came a-courting me.My father couldna’ work, and my mother couidna’spin;I toil’d day and night, but their bread I couldna’win;Auld Robin maintained them baith, and wi’ tearsin his e’e,Said, “Jenny, for their sakes, O, marry me!”My heart it said nay—I look’d for Jamie back;But the wind it blew high, and the ship it was awrack,The ship it was a wrack, why didna’ Jamie dee?Oh ! why was I spared to cry, wae’s me ?My father urged sair; my mither didna’ speak,She looked in my face till my heart was like tobreak,So they gi’ed him my hand, tho’ my heart was atthe sea,Now auld Robin Gray is gudeman to me.I hadna’ been a wife a week but only four,When sitting sae mournfully ae night at the door,I saw my Jamie’s wrath, for I couldna’think it he,Till he said, I’m come back, love, to marry thee.310, sair did we greet, and muckle did we say;We took but ae kiss, and we tore ourselves away,I wished I were dead; but I’m no like to dee,Oh! why do I live to say, waes me ?I gang like a ghaist, and I carena’ to spin;I darena’ think on Jamie, for that would be a sinBut I’ll do my best a gudewife to be,For auld Robin Gray is kind to me.Mae langer she wept—her tears were a’ spent—Despair it was come, and she thought it content,Sie thought it content, but her cheek it grew pale,And she dropp’d like a lily broke down by the hail.MY LOVE SHE’S BUT A LASSIE YET.My love she’s but a lassie yet,My love she’s but a lassie yet,We’ll let her stand a year or twa,She’ll no be half sae saucy yet.I rue the day I sought her, O;I rue the day I sought her, O;Wha gets her needna’ say he’s woo’d,But he may say he’s bought her, O.3ome draw a drap o’ the best o’t yet,Come draw a drap o’ the best o’t yet,lae seek for pleasure whare you will,But here I never mist ityet.We’re a’ dry wi’ the drinking o’t,We’re a’ dry wi’ the drinking o’t,Che minister kiss’d the Adler’s wife,And couldna’ preach for thinking o’t.22O’ER THE MOOR AMANG THEHEATHER.O’er the moor amang the heather,O’er the moor amang the heather,There I met a bonny lassie,Keeping a’ her ewes thegither,Says I, my dear where is thy hame,In moor or dale, pray tell me whither ?She says, I tent the fleecy flocksThat feed amang the blooming heather.We lay down upon £i bank,Sae warm and sunny was the weather,She left her flocks at large to roveAmang the bonny blooming heather.While thus we lay, she sung a sang,Till echo rang a mile and farther,And aye the burden o’ the sangWas o’er the moor amang the heather.She charm’d my heart, and aye sinsyne,I couldna’ think on any ither;By sea and sky she shall be mine,The bonny lass amang the heather.AULD LANGSYNE.Should auld acquaintance be forgot,An’ never brought to mind ?Should auld acquaintance be forgot,An’ days o’ langsyne ?For auld langsyne, my dear,For auld langsyne;We’ll tak’ a cup o’ kindness yet,For auld langsyne.23We twa hae run about the braes,An’ pu’d the gowans fine;But we’ve wander’d mony a weary fit.Sin’ auld langsyne.We twa hae paidel’t in the burn,When summer days were prime ;But seas between us braid hae roar’d,Sin’ auld langsyne.An’ here’s a hand my trusty friend,And gie’s a hand o’ thine,And we’ll tak’ a right gude-willie waught,For auld langsyne.And surely ye’ll be your pint-stoup,As sure as I’ll be mine;An’ we’ll tak’ a cup o’ kindness yet,For auld langsyne.I GAED A WAEFU’ GATE YESTREEN.I gaed a waefu’ gate yestreen,A gate, I fear, I’ll dearly rue;I got my death frae twa sweet een,Twa lovely een o’ bonnie blue.Twas not her golden ringlets bright;Her lips like roses wat wi’ dew,Her heaving bosom, lily-white ;It was her een sae bonnie blue.She talked, she smiled, my heart she wiled ;She charmed my soul, I wistna’ how;And aye the stound, the deadly wound,Cam’ frae her een sae bonnie blue.HBut spare to speak, and spare to speed,She’ll aiblins listen to my vow;Should she refuse, I’ll lay my deadTo her twa een sae bonnie blue.ROBIN.There was a lad was born in Kyle,But whatna’ day or whatna style,I doubt it’s hardly worth the while,To be so nice wi’ Robin.Robin was a rovin’ boy,Rantin’ rovin’, rantin’ rovin’;Robin was a rovin’ boy,Rantin’ rovin’ Robin!Our monarch’s hindmost year but ane,Was five-and-twenty days begun,’Twas then a blast o’ Januar’ win’,Blew hansel in on Robin !The gossip keekit in his loof,Quo’ she, wha lives will see the proof,This waly boy will be na’ coof,I think we’ll ca’ him Robin.He’ll ha’e misfortunes great and sma’,But aye a heart aboon them a’;He’ll be a credit tae us a’;We’ll a’ be proud o’ Robin.But sure as three times three mak’ nine,I see by ilka score and line,This chap will dearly like our kin’,So leeze me on thee, Robin.

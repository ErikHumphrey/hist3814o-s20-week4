I to yon will tell;Which being rightly understood,I know will please you well.This Robin (so much talk’d on)was once a man of fame,Entitled Earl of Huntington,lord Robin Hood by name:In courtship and magnificence,his carriage won him praise,And greater favour with his prince,than any in his days.In bounteous liberality,he toe much did exeeb4And loved men of quality,more than exceeding well.His great revenues all he sold,for wine and costly cheer*He kept three hundred bowmen hold,he shooting lov’d so dealNo archer living in his time,with him might well compare ;He practic’d all his youthful primethat exercise most rare.At last, by his profound expence,he had consum’d his wealth ;And being out-law’d by his prince.In woods he liv’d by stealth.The Abbot of St Mary’s rich,to whom he money owed ;His hatred to the Earl was sucti,that he his downfall wrought;So being out-lawed, as ’tis told,he with a crew went forth.Of lusty cutlers, stout and bold,and robbed in the North.Amongst the rest, one Little John,a yeoman bold and free.Who could (if it stood him upon)with ease encounter thmOne hundred men in all lie got,with whom, the story says.Three hundred common men durst nothold combat any ways.The Yorkshire woods frequented mucli,and Lancashire also;Wherein the practices were suchthat they wrought muckle woe,None rich durst travel to and fro,tho’ ne’er so strongly arm’d;But by these thieves, so strong in shew,they still were rob’d and harm’d.H is chiefest spite to the clergy was,that liv’d in monstrous pride ;No one of them he could let passalong the highway side;But first they must to dinner go,and afterwards to shift;Full many a one he served so,thus while he liv’d by theft.No monks or friars he would let go,without paying their fees ;If they thought much to be used so,their gear he made them leave.For such as they the country fill’dwith hastanls in those davs :0Which to prevent those sparks did geldall that came in their ways.But Robin Hood so gently was.and bore so brave a mind.If any in distress should pass,to them he was so kind.That he would give and lend to them,to help them in their need;Thus made all poor men pray for himand wish he well might speed.The widow and the fatherlesshe would send means unto ;And those who famine did oppress,found him a friendly foe:Nor would he do the woman wrong,but see her safe convey’d ;He would protect with power strong,All those who crav’d his aid.The Abbot of St. Mary’s then,who undid him before,Was riding with his two hundred men,and gold and silver storeBut Robin Hood upon him setwith his courageous sparks.And all the coin by force did get,which was twelve thousands merks.7He bound the Abbot to 3 tree,and would not let him pass.Before that (to his men and he}his lordship said a mass,Which being done, upon his horsehe set him fast astride.And with his face the contrair course,he forced him to ride.His men were forc'd to be his guide,for he rode backwards home ;The Abbot being thus vilified,did sorely chafe and foam. .Thus Robin Hood did vindicatehis former wrongs receiv’d;For ’twas the covetous prelate,that him of land bereav’d.The Abbot he rode to the king,with all the haste he could;And to his grace he every thingexactly did unfold :And said, that if no course was tafen(by force or stratagem)To take this rebel and his train,no man could pass for them.The king protested by and by,unto the AM>ot then.8That Robin Hood with speed should di*with all his merry men :But ere the king did any send,he did another feat.Which did his grace much more offend,the fact indeed was great.For in a short time after,the king’s receiver’s wentTowards London with the coin they gotfor’s highness’s northern rent.Bold Robin Hood and Little John,with the rest of their train,Not dreading law, set them upon*and did their gold obtain.The king much moved at the same,and th’ Abbot’s talk also,In this his anger did proclaim,and sent words to and fro.That whosoe’er alive or dead,could bring him Robin Hood,Should have one thousand merks well paid,In gold and silver good.This promise of the king’s did makfull many a yeoman bold.Attempt stout Robin Hood to takewith all the force they couldBut still when any came to him,within the gay green wood;And wanted for to speak to him,his men in order stood.He shew’d to them such martial sportwith his long how and arrow.That they of him did give repor*how that it was great sorrow.That such a worthy man as he,should thus be put to shift,Being of late a lord of high degree,of living quite bereft.The king to take him more and more,sent men of meikle might;But he and his still beat them sore,and conquer’d them in fight;Or else with love and courtesyto him lie won their hearts;rlhus still he liv’d by robbery,throughout the northern parts.And all the country stood in dread,of Robin and his men ;For stouter lads ne’er liv’d by breadn those days, nor since then ;I he Abbot w hich before 1 nam’d,sought all the means he could,10To have by force this rebel ta’en,and his adherents bold.Therefore he arm’d five hundred menwith furniture complete;But the out-laws slew half of themand made the rest retreat;The long bow and the arrow keen,they were so used unto,That still he kept the forest greenIn spite of the proudest foe.dji'd to m > r. a ; Id jimo'lTwelve of the Abbot’s men he took,who came to have him ta’en ;When all the rest the field forsook,these he did entertainWith banqueting and merrimentand, having used them well.He to their landlord them safely sent,and will’d them him to tell.That if lie would be pleased at lastto beg of our good king,That he might pardon what was past,and hint to favour bring:He would surrender back againthe money, which beforeWas taken by him and his menfrom him and many more.Poor men might safely pass by him,and some that way would chuse ;For well they knew, that to help them,he ever more did use.But where he knew a miser richthat did the poor oppress.To feel his coin his hands did itch,he’d have it more or less.And sometimes when the high way failthen he his courage rouses ;He and his men have oft assail’dSuch rich men in their houses.So that thro‘ dread of Rohin then,and his advent’rous crew,The misers kept great store of men.which else maintain’d hut lew.King Richard, of that name the first,Sur-named Cceiir de Lion ;Went to defeat the Pagans curst;who kept the coasts of Siofi.The bishop of Ely, chancellor,was the vice-roy here ;Who, like a potent emperor,did proudly domineer.Our chronicles of him report,that commonly he rode.12With a thousand horse from court to court,where he would make abode:He riding down towards the north,with his aforesaid train ;Robin and men did issue forth,them all to entertain.And with the gallant grey goose wing,they shew’d to them such play,They made their horses kick and fling,and down their riders lay.Full glad and fain the bishop was,for all his thousand men.To seek what means he could to passFrom out of Robin’s ken.Two hundred of his men were kill’d,and fourscore horses good ;Thirty, who did as captives yield,were carried to the green wood ;Which afterwards were ransomedfor twenty merks a man.The rest set spurs to horse and fledto the town of Warrington.Tho Bishop sore enraged then,did in king Richard’s name.Muster up a power of northern menthese out-laws bold to tame:13But Robin with his courtesy,so won the meanest sort.That they were loth on him to trywhat rigour did import.So that bold Robin and his train,did live unhurt by them,Until King Richard came,from fair JerusalemAnd then the talk of Robin Hood,his royal ears did fill;His grace admir’d that in the green woodhe was continued still.So that the country far and near,did give him great applauseBut none of them need stand in tear,but such as broke the lawsHe wished well unto the king.and pray’d still for his healthAnd never practis’d any thing,against his common-wealthOnly because he was undoneby the cruel clergy then ;All means that he could think upon,to vex such cruel men.He enterpris’d with hateful spleen.In which he was to blame.14For fault o some to wreck his teen,«n all that by him came.With wealth which he by robbery got,eight aim-houses he built;Thinking thereby to purge the blotof blood which he had spilt;Such was their blind devotion then,depending on their works 5Which, if ’twere true, we ChristiansInferior were to Turks.f. • j. • ; c, iHBut to speak true of Robin Hoodand wrong him not a jotYet never would shed any man’s bloodthat him invaded not:Nor would he injure husbandmen,that toil at cart or plough ;For well he knew were’t not for them,to live no man knew how\The king in person, with some lordsto Nottingham did ride.To try what strength and skill affords,to crush the out-laWs pride:And as he once before had done,he did again proclaim,That whosoever would take upon,to bring to Not nghan'.Or any place within the lands.rebellious Robin Hood,Shdiild he preferred in place to standwith those of noble blood.When Robin heard of the sametfitliin a little space,Into the town of Nottingham,a letter to bis graceHe shot upon an arrow head,one evtening cunningly jWhich was brought to the king and read,heford his majesty:The tenor of the letter was,that Robin wbuld Submit,And be true liege-man to his grace.In any thing that’s fit.So that his highness would forgivehim and his merry men all;If not, he must in the green wood live,and take what chance did fall.The king would fain have pardon’d him,hut that some lords did say.This precedent will much condemnyour grace another day..v w-nrh vm v l!» nlWhile that the king and lords did staydebating on this thing,1GSome of the out-laws fled awayutito the Scottish king;For they suppos’d if he was ta’en,or to the king did yield.By the comm ms ail the rest of’s train,lull quickly would be quell’d.Of more than full an hundred men,but forty tarried still.Who were resolved to stick to himlet fortune work her will;If none had fled, all for his sakehad got their pardon free;The king to favour meant to takehis merry men and he.But ere the pardon to him came,this famous archer died;His death and manner of the same,'ll p resently describe,For being vex’d to think uponhis followers revolt,In melancholy passionhe did recount his fault.Perfidious traitors, said he thenIn all your dangers past,Have I you guarded as my men,*o leave me thus at last i17This sad perplexity did causea fever, as some say.Which him into confusion draws,though in a stranger way.This deadly danger to prevent,he hied him with all speedInto a nunnery, with intentfor his health’s sake to bleed,A faithless friar did there pretend,In love, to let him blood;Bu he by falseness wrought the enof famous Robin Hood.The friar, as some say, did thisto vindicate the wrongWhich to the clergy him and hishad done by power strong.Thus died he by treachery,who could not die by force;Had he liv’d longer, certainlyking Richard, in remorse.Had into favour him received,his brave men elevated;’Tis pity he was of live bereaved,by one that he so hated:A treacherous leech this friar wasto let him bleed to death ;18And Robin was rnethinks an ass,to trust him with his breath.His corps the prioress of the placo,(the day next that he died,)Caused to be buried (in mean case)Close by the high-way side ;And over him she caus’d a stoneto be fixed in the groundAn epitaph was set thereon,wherein his name was found,The day of the year, and date also,she made to be set on there,i hat all that by that way did go,might see it plain appear;That such a man as Robin Hood.was buried in that place:And how he liv’d in the green wood,and robb’d there for a space.It seems that tho’ the clergy hehad put to muchle woe.He should not quite forgotten be,altho’ he was their foe :This woman tho’ she did him hate,yet lov’d his memory ;And thought it a wonderous pity thathis fame with him should die.llis epitaph, as records tell,within these hundred yearsBy many was discerned well,hut time all thing out-wears.His followers, when he was deadwere some received to grace ;The rest to foreign countries fled,and left their native place.And though his funeral was but mean,this woman had in mind,That his fame should be buried clean,from those that came behind:f'or certainly before, nor since,no man e’er understood,Under the reign of any prince,pf one like Robin Hood•Full thirteen years and something more,these out-laws lived thus,Fear’d of the rich, lov’d of the poor,a thing most marvellousA thing impossible to usthis story seems to be:None dare be now so venturous,but times are chang’d we see... We that live in those latter daysof pivil government.(If need be) have an hundred wayssuch out-laws *to prevent.m those days men more barbarous were,and lived less in awe ;Now, God be thanked, people fear,more to offend the law.No roaring guns were then in use,they dreamt of no such thing;Our Englishmen in fight did chuse,the gallant grey goose wing ;In which activity those men,through practice were so good.That in those days none cquall’d them,especially Robin Hood.So that it seems keeping in caves,in woods and forests thick.They’d heat a multitude with staves,their arrows did so prick ;And none durst near unto them come,unless in courtesy ;All such he bravely would send homewith mirth and jollity.■ti'iJih I ■ - tl gfloMWhich courtesy won him such love,as I before have told ;’Twas the chief cause that he did provemore prosperous than he would;Let us Le thankful for these timesof plenty, truth, and peace ;And leave our great and horrid crimes,lest they cause this to cease.I know there’s many feigned tales,of Robin and his crew.But chronicles which seldom fail,report this to he true;Let none then think this is a lie,for if ’twere put to the worst.They might the truth descry,in reign of Richard the first.If any reader please to try,as I direction shew.The truth of this brave history,he’ll find it true I know ;And I shall think my labour wellbestow’d to purpose good,When’t shall be said, that I did telltrue tales of Robin Hood.2‘>The Epitaph which the Prioress of the Moh-astry of Kirkslay in Yorkshire, set overRobin Hood, which (as before mentioned)was to be read within these hundred years,though in old broken English, much to the jsame sense and meaning.Ml DwraMiflDecembris quarto Die 1 198.

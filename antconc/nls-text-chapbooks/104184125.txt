THEHERMIT OF POWISBALLAD ROMANCE©f the ©then ^tmes.ABERDEEN:G-IEOIR-a-IE IVCIIDIDXiETOlSr,SKENE SQUARE,187LIBRT^^ OF SCOTLANDThe Hermit of Fowis lived in his cell,And shunned the converse of man ;His food was the coarsest, his drink was the brookThat near to the Hermitage ran.He mumbled his prayers, and counted his beads,And scourged his flesh wi’ twine,In the hope to atone for the sins of the soulBy the body’s doll and pine.And who was the Hermit, and what were his sins,That merited penance so drear ?—List ye to the tale of a soothfast bard,And both shall quickly appear :The Hermit had stood a noble EarlIn the presence of his King—Had gaily hunted the boar and the stag,And fought in the field and the ring.The Hermit now so withered and grim,Was an Earl so fair to see,That there was no’ a lady in a’ the landBut had sighed at the blink o’ his e’e.But the Earl gave his heart to the fairest maidIn the bounds of Scotland wide—To the sweet Mary Hay, the flower o’ the Don,And her father’s hope and pride.But her father was no’ a belted knight,But a man of low degree,And it grieved his heart his daughter’s loveFor a noble Earl to see.“ There never cam’ good o’ a lordling’s loveFor a maid so lowly bom ;He’ll win your heart, and break your heart,And leave you the scath and the scorn.”3“0 little d’ye ken, my father dear,This leal Lord’s love for me ;He’s won my heart, and he’s sought my hand.And his bride I have sworn to be.”And the Earl so loved this lowly maid,That he gave her his lordly hand,And made her mistress of all his castles,And lady of all his land.And time ran on till a year had gone,But never, by night or day,Was the gallant Leslie absent fromThe side of his Mary Hay.The noblemen round might look askance,Their ladies might scoff and sneer ;His Mary was all the world to him,And he to her was as dear.Till town and country, high and low.The truth must needs declare,That never, in palace, castle, or cot,Had been witnessed a happier pair.But it fell on a day, a sweet summer’s day,That there came, with white foam o’er,A steed with a royal messenger.And this was the message he bore ;“ Boot ye ! Spur ye ! noble Earl—Go saddle your steed and ride !For the English loons, with fire and sword,Have crossed the border side.“ And need have we of our bravest knights,And need of their stoutest men,And stouter or braver than you, Lord Earl,There’s none in our royal ken.”When Mary heard this message read,Her cheeks grew pale and wan,But when she saw her Leslie’s steedThe tears in torrents ran,“ 0, let me gang, my Leslie dear,Your perils all to share ?I’ll run a foot page by your side,The battle field I’ll dare.4When dangers flash around your head,I’ll cry to heaven to save ;And if you’re wounded in the fight,My care will cheat the grave.”“ That never could be, my darling wife—But I’ll not tarry long,For numerous are our Scottish bands,Their hearts are brave and strong.And soon we’ll drive the English loonsAcross the border side,And I’ll bring fouth of Southern spoilTo deck my lovely bride. ”“ I care no’ for pearls, jewels, nor gold,Nor robes of silken sheen,I’d rather have you, my Leslie, safe,Than the splendours of a qtieen.”Lord Leslie kissed her lips and cheeks,As pale as the lily flower ;Then bade her maidens bear her in,And tend her well in her bower.But when he rode from his castle doorAt the head of his warlike band,His Mary Hay was the saddest wifeIn all the Scottish land.Our Scottish king his warlike bandsLed forth in gallant order,And drove the Southern loons, like sheep,Over the English border.Then boldly marched on Southern soilTo pay them ill for ill,And drove the beeves from off their fields,And the sheep from off the hill.And when he’d paid the knavish loonsA penny for their plack,He led his troops with little lossAnd mickle plunder back.And feasted at the Scottish courtFor thirty days and three,The noble lords who in the warHad borne him company.5And fonnest in the field of fight,And foremost in the sport,The brave Earl Leslie bore the palmO’er all the Scottish court.The Lady Arabella Stewart,The daughter of a king,Tho’ her mother did not share a throneNor wear a wedding ring,Oast eyes on this same noble lordIn her royal brother’s hall,And saw him, in face and courtly grace,The fairest of them all.And she has gotten her to the king,Fallen low down on her knee—“ 0 royal Lord, 0 brother dear,An asking grant to me !”“ Rise up ! Rise up ! Our sister dear,Your asking you shall have,Be it gold or gear, or house or land,Or title, that ye crave.”“ I crave nor title, house, nor land,I crave nor gold, nor gear.But it’s all for a lord at your royal courtThat I plead in your royal ear.Lord Leslie he has ensnared my heart,By arts that I cannot divine ;And I crave your aid, my sovereign liege,This witchery to untwine.”• ‘ And if Lord Leslie has stolen your heart,This choice to him I’ll gie,Either to offer you marriage to-morrow,Or else to be hanged on a tree. ”Lord Leslie sat and laughed and joked,In the midst of a merry ring,When word was brought him to repairTo audience with the King.“There’s a nobleman at our court, Lord Earl,Partaking our royal cheer,Who by wicked art has trepanned the heartOf a lady that we hold dear./6The Lady Arabella Stewart,The fairest of our fair,Has lost her heart, and to you Lord Earl,Deny it if you dare.But you are a true and a warlike lord,And this is the choice we’ll gie—Either to marry the lady we’ve named,Or swing like a rogue on a tree.”“My Liege ! my Sire ! my Sovereign Lord !I’ve used no wizardrie,And if I have won the heart of this maid,The prize was unsought by me.And if my choice be to wed or to hang,My Sire, I must lose my life,For how can I wed Lady Arabel Stewart,And leave a better-loved wife ?”“And who may be this wife, Lord Earl,That you hold so woudrous dear ;And how does it chance that the lady’s nameShould never have reached our ear ?”“ My wife is not sprung from noble sires—Her kin are of low degree,But dear as a queen to her royal spouseIs the choice of my heart to me. ”“ A peasant can be but a leman, my Lord,To one that is nobly born,And, the word of a King, you’ll marry our ward,Or swing ere a second grey morn !”The brave Lord Leslie left the King,A doleful man I ween ;But a change took place in his comely faceThat day ere the fall of e’en.That day was holden a tournament,The Queen was taken ill—And who but the Lady Arabel StewartWas chosen her place to fill.Right well she played her Queenly part,And channed the hearts of a’;But for every smile she gave the restShe gave Lord Leslie twa.When days had come and days had passed,Lord Leslie had no’ swung,But for him and the Lady Arabel Stewart,The wedding bells were rung.And he has gotten a trusty pageHis messages all to bear,And sent him on to Mary HayTo break the tidings with care.To offer her gold, to offer her gear,To offer her houses or land—To tell her that she was free to loveAnd many a lowlier man.The news were said, the offers were made,And the salt tears did no’ come ;But she sat like a statue, or corpse of the dead,As motionless, paly, and dumb.She never cast blame on her faithless lord,Nor uttered one word to displease,But she drooped her head like a frost-nipt rose,And faded by slow degrees.And day by day she withered away,Till the fell destroyer DeathLaid his skeleton hand on her marble lips,And checked their quivering breath.Now word’s gone on to Edinburgh town,And reached Lord Leslie’s ear,That the cold earth lay on the Mary HayWhom he once had valued so dear.“ 0 woe’s me now !” Lord Leslie cried,As he tore his raven hair,“I’ve killed the fairest, dearest wife,That ever breathed Northern air.Love me, Lady Arabel Stewart!Well may you love me noo,For I’ve blighted the fairest flower of the North,And all for the sake of you !Well may ye sigh, Lady Arabel Stewart,And well may your tears be shed ;But ye canna bring peace to this perjured heart,Unless ye bring back the dead !”8Lord Leslie fled away from his home,And none knew whither he went;His lands fell in to his next of kin,And his gold by his lady was spent.But when years had sped, and his lady was dead.And his name forgotten ’mongst men,A Hermit appeared in Powis’s grounds,And made him a sort of a den.He prayed, and starved, and scourged himself,Till his lean frame leaner grew,But at last the curtain dropt on the scene,And then the truth we knew.For a scroll was found hy the side of the corpse,And these were the words it bore :“ This is the clay of Leslie the Earl,Who sinned and suffered so sore.”I’ve told this tale of the days of oldIn a simple, homely strain,But if it create one thought like this,It has not been told in vain :An hcmest, truthful, rightful courseIs the best for death or time.For present anguish and f uture woeAre the offspring of vice and crime.Davidson & Smith.

RANDALL,,eSoi,An ACCOUNT of feme IMAGINARYAPPARITIONS.yin Imaginary Apparition, the Ejjt'El of Fear.From the Sec Ms of the Invfible IVmid laid open.A Sober grave gentleman, who muft notwear a name in our Tory becaufe itwas rather a diftemper in his mind than areal deficiency of brains, had by a long dif-ufe of the fprightly part of his fenfe, whichhe really had no want of at other times, fuf-fered hrmfelf to fink a little too low in hisfpirits, and let the Hypochondria emit tofirongly in the vapour and fumes up into hishead.' This had its fits and intervals; fome-times he was’ clear-fighted, and clear head¬ed, but at other times he faw flats at noon¬day, and devils at night : in a word, theworld was an apparition to his imagination,when the fl itus prevailed, and the fpleeaboiled up : of ad which he could give no ac¬count, nor could he affifl the operation ofphyfic by any of his, own powers towards acure.It happened, the.t he was abroad at afriend’s houfe later than ordinary one night \but being moon light, and having a ftrvant■with him, lie feemed to be eafy and wasobferved to be cheerful and even merry,with a great deal of good-humour, more thanhad been obferved in him lor fome -.ime bc-kmeHe knew his way peffe&ly well, for it wnswithin three miles of the town where he liv¬ed, and he was very, .well mounted ; but( 3 )though the moon was up, an accident, whicha littie difordered him, wa’s, that it wras notonly cloudy, but a very thick, black cloudcame iuddenly ^that is to fay, without hisnotice, To it was fudden to him) and fpreadover his head, which made it very ckrk;and, to add to the diforder, it began to rainviolently.Upon this, being very well mounted, as lbefore obferved, he refolved to ride for it,having not above two milts to the town ; foclapping fpurs to his horie, he ga ! ped away.His man, whofe name was Geivuis not be¬ing fo well mounted was a confxderabie vaybehind. fhe darknefs and the rain toge¬ther put him a little out of humour ; but asthat was a iittle unexpected, o h ip 't madehim ride the harder rather than abate hispace.In the way there was a fmall river, buttheir was a good bridge over it, well walledon both fides ; fo that there was no dangerthere, more than any where elfe ; but thegentleman kept on his fpecd to go over thebridge, when being rather more than halfover, his horfe Hopped on a fudden, and.rtfufed as we call it, bearing off to the righthand ; he faw nothing at hrft, and was notmuch difcompofed at it, but Ipurred hishorie to go forward ; the horie went twb orthree fteps, then (topped again, fnorted, andjiared, and then offered to turn Ihort buck;then the gentleman looking forward to fee..what was the matter, and if he could obfervewhat the horie was feared at, law two broad( 4 }flaring eyes, which, as he faid, looked himfull in the lace.Then he was heartily frighted ; but bythis time he heard his man Gervah comingup. When Gervais came near, ihe firfl thinghe heard his mafter fay, was Blefs me, itis the Devil! at which Gervais, aJow fpiritedfellow, was as much frighted as his mailer,however his mailer a little encouraged to hearhis man fo near him, prefs’d his horfe oncemore, and called aloud to Gervais to come ;but he, as. I faid, being frighted too, madeno halte ; at length with much ado his mailerfpurring his horfe again, got over the bridge,and palfed by the creature with broad eyes,which (the light a little increaiing he affirmedpofilively, when he \yas paffed, was a great |black Bear, and confequently mull be theDevil.Tbp’ Gervais was near enough, yet fear¬ing his mailer would let him to go before, the kept as far off as he could : When hismailer called he anfwered indeed, but didnot come on, at lead did not make much |halle ; but feeing his mailer was gone pall, |,and that he himlelf was then obliged to tol-iow. he went on fofdy, and when becameto the bridge, he law what hjs maders hqrh?fuorted at, and relufcd to go on ; of whichyou lhali hear morf prefently.His madtr’s horfe being got pad the dif¬ficulty, needed no fpyrs. but (as frighted )horfes will flew away iiks the wind ; and therain continuing, his mailer, who on manyaccounts was willing to be at home, let lum|f 5 }fo that he was at home and got into thehoufe, long before his man Gervais couldget up with him.The matter, as foon as he came into thelight, fwooned away, and the fright hadfuch an e lie ft upon him, that when 'wkhmuch difficulty they had brought him tohimfelf, he continued very ill ; and when hislady and' a fitter he had in the houfe withhim, as much over-run with the Hippo ashimfelf, came to enquire what had happen¬ed to him ; he told them a formal ftory, that■ at fuch a bridge he met the Devil; that heplaced himfcll juft at the coming off from thebridge, on his left hand, at the corner ofthe wall ; that he ttood and ftared in his face,and that he could diftinftty perceive it wasthe Devil in the fliape of a iitar, He gave o-ther deicripiions, fo punftua! and particular,that there was no room to doubt but it wasan apparition, and that it was in the fhapeof a great bear.GERVAIS came home foon after, andgoing into the liable direftly, as w^as his bu-finefs. to take care ot his matter's horfe aswell as his own, there he told the ftory hisway, among the other fervants, and efpeci-ally two or three grooms or fervants balong-ing to gentlemen that were neighbours; andhe tells them that his matter was in great dan¬ger of being thrown over the wall of the bridge^for that his horfe was frighted at an afs whichHood at the corner of the wall, and it wasmy fault indeed, fays Gervais, for it was ayoung horfe* aad I had never told my maf~C 6 )ter ; but it was a trick he had got, that hecould not abide an afs', and would by nomeans come near one if he could help it.And are you fure it was an afs Gervals ?fay the other fervants, flaring at one anotheras if they were frighted : Are you 'hire ofit? Yes, fays Gervais, for as foon as mymafter got by it, I rode up to it and threfhedit with my flick and it fell a braying, whichyou know, fays Gervais, is a bafe ugly none,and fo I came away and left itWhy Gervais, fay they, your under be¬lieves it was the Devil, as really as if he h;.Jfpoken to it.I am forry my mafler fhould be fo fright¬ed, fays Gervais ; but I am very lure it uasnothing but an afs. But the fiory had goi-ten vent, and the firft part of it flew all overthe town, that Mr. had feen the Deviland was almoft frighted to death.Then came his man GervaiVs tale andmade it appear that Mr.  ’s flrange andwonderful apparition was dwindled into anafs, and that the Devil he had feen, in thefhape of a bear was no more than a poorBarico ; as the Italians call him ; this, madehis mafler be laughed at fufficiently.However poor Jarvis or Gervais was fainto turn out, and loft his place tor it j and thewife Mr.   to this day infills upon it,that it was the Devil and he knew him byhis broad eyes; though it is known that abear has very little eyes : But it is impofiibleto perfuade any vapourifh body, that theyhave aot feen the Devil,, if they have butC 7 )f-een ibmething, and that they are very farethey are not fme what it is. ,HjAfAn Imaginary Apparition the effect of 1 mud, fixn\the Sn retf oj the invifibU world, laid dp'esf .. ■;A Perfon who kept a lodging houfe nearJl\. the fprings, at \ixria-Chapeiie. hav¬ing iolt Ins wile, committed the manage¬ment of his family to his ibughter* a.fpi ight-ily well made hanuforne girl, about twenty.There was at tint time in the houfe twoladies and their waiting woman, two Dutch,officers and a Dominican friar.It happened that as the young woman ofthe hcule w,.s afleep one night in hex bed,fire was awakened by fomething that at¬tempted to draw the clothes oil the bed,fhe was at hr ft frighted, but thinking, uponrecollection, that it might be the houie dog,file called him by his name : The deathshowever, were ftili pulled from her, and fherftill imagining it was by the dog, took- upa brufli that lay in her reach, and attemptedto Unite him. At that moment ihe i'aw a flafhof fudden hglit that filled the whole room ;upon which fhe fhrieked out, at the fametime covering her face with the fheet : W henihe again ventured to look out, ail was darkapd filent, and the deaths were no longerdrawn from her.In the morning when flic related this floryevery one treated it as a dream, and the girlhcrlelf at lad took it for granted, that it wasno more than an illufivm( 8 }The night following flie was again awak¬ened by fcmething that jogged her, and (hethought {he felt a hand in the bed ; upon en¬deavouring to reprefs it, another flalh oflightening threw her into a fit of terror ; {hefhut her eyes and croffed herfelf: When fireventured to open her eyes again, the lightwas vanished, and in a Ihort time die feltwhat (he fuppofed to be a hand again in thebed ; {he again endeavoured to reprefs it ;but looking towards the foot of the bed, diefaw a large luminous crofs on which waswritten didinctly, as with' light, the wordsBe fdent. She was now fo terrified, that diehad not pov/er to break the injunction, butfhe fhrunk down into the bed, and coveredherfelf all over with the cloaths.In this fituation fhe lay a confulerabletime, and being no longer moiefted, dieventured once more to peep out when, to herunfpeakable aftonidiment, die faw a phan-tafm {landing by the fide of h< r bed, almoltas high as the ceiling, a kind of glory en¬circled its head, and the whole was in the ;jform of a crucifix, except that it feemed tohave feveral hands, one of which again ap¬proached the bed.Suppofing the phaencmtnon to be fomeceleftial vifion, die exerted all her forti¬tude, and leaping out of bed, threw herfelfupon her knees before it but die inftantlyfound herfelf alfaulted in a manner whichconvinced her die was miftaken; die hadnot ftrength to difengage herfelf from fome-Ihijig that embraced her, and therefore( 9 )fcreamed out as loud as die could 'to alarmthe houfe, and bring fomcbody to her aflift-ance.Her Ihrieks awakened the ladies who layin an adjacent chamber, and fbcy font theirwoman to fee what was the matter Thewoman, uj-on opening the room taw a lumhnous phantafm, which preatly terrified her>and heard in a deep threatening tone theword At thy peril begone.The woman infiantly fcreamed out, andwithdrew ; the ladies role in the utmofk con-fternaticn. and terror, but nobody came totheir affiflance ; the criei man, the father ofthe girl, was afie? p in a remote part of thei houfe ; the friar'alfo relied in a room at thexend of a long gallery in another ftory ; andthe two Dutch officers were abfent on a vifitat a neighbouring village.No other violence, however, was offeredto the girl that night. As foon as the mor ¬ning dawned fne got up, ran down to her fa¬ther, and told all that had happened ; thetwo ladies were not long abfent, they didnot fay much, but difeharged their arrears,and quitted the houfe. The friar a Iked the girl:j feveral queftions, and declared that he had(I heard ether infiances of the like nature, butfaid, the girl would do well to obey the com-mands of the vifion, and that no harm wouldcome of it. He laid he would remain tolee the iffue, and in the mean time, he or¬dered proper prayers and rnaffes to be faidat a neighbouring convent of Iris order, towhich h* molt devoutly joined his own.( TO )The girl was comforted with this fpiritualaffiftance, i ur, aotwithftrniiing, took oneof the maids to be her bedfellow the nextnight.In the dead of the night the flaming crofswas again viflble, but no.attempt was madeon either'of the women. They were liow-ever, crratly terrified and the feivant laid,ihe would rathe r leave her place than lie'inthe room againThe Iriar the next morning took the meritof the fpirit’s peaceable hehaviom to himfetf.The prayers atid maff.s were renewed, andapplication was made to the convents ofLiege ior auxiliary afliltance. The goodfriar in the mean time, was by no means idleat home ; he performed his devotions withgreat ardour, and towards evening he be*fi:owed a pienuful libation of holy water onthe chamber and the bed.Trie girl not being able to peTuade thefervant to deep with her again in the haunt¬ed room, and being encouraged by the fri¬ar to abide the ifl’ue, having alfo great con¬fidence herfelt in the prayers, mattes, andiprinklings that had been ufed on the cc-cattcn fhe ventured once more to flec-p inthe Lme room by herfeif.In the night, after hearing feme flightnodes, fhe faw the room all in a blaze, anda great number of fmall luminous crofies,^vitn ferips of writing here and there very le¬gible, among which the precept to be fiierrt,•was mott: confpicuous.In the middle of the room fhe faw fume-C )thing of a human appearance, which feemedcovered only with a linen garment, like afirm ; it appeared to ditTufe a radiance roundit. and at length, by a flow and blent pace,it approacl ed the bed - Wheruit came up tothe bed-fide it drew the curtain more open,and lifted i p the bed-cloaths was about tocome in.. The girl now more terrified thanever, fereamed out with all her power; asevery body in the houfe was upon the watch,fhe was heard by them all, but ihe fatheronly bad courage to go to her afiiiftance, andhis bravery was probably owing to a confi-derable quantity of relioues which he hadprocured from the convent, and which hebrought in his hand.When he came, however, nothing was tobe feer. but feme of the little.croffes and iu-feripiions, fcveral of which were now lumi¬nous only in part.Iking himfelf greatly terrified at thcle ap.pearances, he ran to the friar’s apartment,and v/ith fome difficulty prevailed upon himto go with him to the haunted room, the friarat firlt excufed him lei f upon account of theyoung woman’s being there in bed. as foonSas he entered and few the erodes, he prof-trated himfelt upon the ground, and uttered'many prayers and incantations, to which thehoneft landlord find AmenThe poor girl, in the mean time, lay in akind of trance, and her father, when theprayers were over, ran down flairs for fome1 wine, a cordial being neceflary. to recover' her j the friar at the fame time, ordered him( 15 )to light ahd bflfrg ■evith hiiit a conftcratedtaper, for hiihetto they had had no light butthat of the vifiort; which was full ftrong e-nough to difcover any thing in the room.In a (hott *ime the old man entered with ataper in his hand, and in a anomeht all th^luminous appearances vanilhed. 'I'he girl,loon after, recovered, and gave a very fernfible account of all that had happened, andthe landlord and the friar fpent the reft ofthe night together.The friar, however, to fhew the power of the |demon and the holy virtue of the taper, re<- dmoved it fevcral times from the chamber be¬fore the day broke, and the croftes and in-fcriptions were again viftble, and remainedfo till the taper was brought back, and thenvanifhed as at firft.When the funarofe, the friar took his leaveto go to Mauins, and did not return tillnoon. In the mean time the two Dutch of¬ficers catlm home, and foon learnt what hadhappened, though the landlord took all the jpaihs he could to conceal it. the reports |they heard \v:re confirmed by the pale and :«terrified appearance of the girl j their curio-fity was greatly excited, and they afked herinnumerable queftions.Her antwers, inftead of extirguifhing, in-creafed it : They allured the landlord thatthey would not leave his houfe, but, on the fcontrary, would afford him all the aflift-ance in their power.As they were young gentlemen of a militaryprofeffion, and Proteftants, they were at( *3 )i once bold and incredulous. They pretend¬ed however, to adopt the opinion of the land¬lord, that the appearances were fiipernatu-ral, but it happened that upon going intothe room they found the remainder of thetaper, on the virtues of which the landlordhad largely expatiated, and immediatelyperceived that it was only a common candleof a large fize, .which he had brought bymiltake in his fright.This difcovery convinced them that therev was a fraud, and that appear prices that va¬il nilhed at the approach of unconfecrated lightii were produced by mere human anifice.'They therefore confulted together, and atI length agreed that the maffes Ihould be con-i tinned, that the landlord Ihould fay not opsword of the candle, or the fufpicions it hadproduced: that his daughter, the. next night,ihould fleep in the apartment which hadbeen quitted by the ladies, and that one ofthe officers Ihould lie in fh: girds bed, whilethe other, ■with the landlord fhould wait inthe kitchen to fee the blue'I his plan was accordingly, jwith great fe-crecy. carried into execution.I Fur two hours aft r the, officer had beenin bed, all was filent and quiet, and he be¬gan to fulpect that the girl had been fanciful,or that their fccret had tranfpired : when aiion a hidden he heard the latch of the doorgently raffed, and perceived fomethiug ap¬proach the bed and attempt to take up thedeaths ; he re lifted with luffi eight ftrengthW kuilr^te the attempt, and immediately theC '4 . )to )in appsaroil to be all irr'a ilmie'; he fi-.vmany croffes and inferiptlons injoinidp ii-lence, and a paflive acqniefcence in whate¬ver fhonld happen ; he law alio in the mid¬dle of the room fomethmg of a hemm: ap¬pearance, very tali and very iatuinou'. I’heI'iiion made a fecond approach to the bed-fide, but ths -gentleman recovering his tor.i-tude the hr it moment of reflection, dexte-roufly threw a flip-knot which he had faftenedto one of the bed-pods over the phantom'sneck, he inftantly drew it ciofe, whichbrought him to the ground, and then threwhimfelf upon him ; the fall and the druggiemade fo much ndife that the other officer andthe landlord ran up with the lights and wea¬pons, and the goblin was found to be no otherthan the good friar, who having conceivedfoniethin-f more than a fpirituai affection forhis landlord’s pretty daughter had playedthis infernal farce- to gra ity ins p -Ifion.It appeared that this h liow, vrho was nearfix feet high, had made himfelf appear (tillhigher, by putting upon his head a kind oftiara of imboffed paper, and had alio thrufta flick through the fleevcs of his habit,which formed an appearance of a crofs, andleft all his hands at liberty ; and that hehad rendered himfelf and his apparatus vili-ble in ths dark by phofphorus.Another—from the life of J Laciington, Booh filer.AT Wilkfcome, nine miles from Taun¬ton a gentleman farmer's houfe was( ). alarmed every ni^ht between twelve and-onei o'clock The chamber doors were throwni open, the bed cioaths pulled off the beds,and the kitchen furniture thrown with vio¬lence about the kitchen, to the great terrorj of the family, infomuch, that the fervantsi gave their maRer and miftrefs warning to: leave their places, and foine of them aftnal-■’ Jy quirted thdr fervice. This dreadful af¬fair had la fifed about fix weeks, when a, young gentleman who was there on a vlft,being in bed one night, at the ufuel hour heI heard his chamber door thrown open and aivesr.y odd noife about his room. He was atfrft frightened, but the noife continuing along time, he became calm and lay ffiil,revolving what he had bell do. When on aAidd.n he heard the fpirit creep under hisbed, which was immediately lifted up, &c.This convinced him that there was font#1 fubRance in the fpirit ; on which h.e leapedout of bed and fecur-.d the door, and withbis oaken Raff belaboured the ghoR underthe bed as hard as he could until he hearda female voice imploring for mercy. Onthat, he opened his chamber door, and cal¬led aloud for a light. The family all got upas faft as poilible, and came to his room, lietlun informeil them that he had got the fpi¬rit under the bed ; on hearing which, modof them were terribly frightened: and wouldhave run off faRer than they came, but heallured them, they bad nothing to.fear : then| out he dragged the h.lf murdered fpirit( i6 )from under the bed. But how jjreht was.their furprife and ihaine, ivhen they difco-vered that this tormenting devil was noother than one of the fervant girls, aboutftxteen years of age, who had been confinedto her bed feveral months by ilinci's.Another—~fr2>u the fame.ANOTtlER apparition had for a longtime dole mmy geefe, turkeys, &c.'4nd although it had been feen by many, yetttobody would venture to go near it : untilgt kngth one perfon a little wifer than the.reft of his neighbours feeing the famous ap¬parition all over white dealing his fowls, wasdetermined to be fully fatisned what kind ofa fpirit it could be that had fo great a predi¬lection for poultry. He accordingly wentjound the yard, and as the apparition wasCuming over the wall, he knocked it down,s and found that this terrible ghoft was aneighbouring woman, who had put on herthread, in order to deter any perlons fhouldthey by chance fee her, from coming nearher. Thus, though {he had for a long timefueceftfully practifed this new way o- procu¬ring poultry, the old fox was caught at left.si? I N I S.

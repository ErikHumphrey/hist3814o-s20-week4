AH ANSWER T©ANDREW MOFFAT’S SMALL POEM,ON SlHcrNGCHURCH-MUSIC.. Er R. Howden.[ShoWLD the Reader suppose the followingverses borrowed from, or built upon Macsar-iANi’s Letter, lately published on the satnesubject, the Author assures him, that thiswas written previous to his seeing the aboveLetter; though he did not intend it at thattime for publication : neither does he comeforward as a combatant with MacFAIXane,but that at the mouth of at least two witnessesthe thing might be established.]My books i saw the other dayWere a’ gone to confusion ;Some’s frontispiece was torn away,Some wanted the conclusion,Some bound in qalf, and some in boards,Some hanging a’ in tatters,Some fu’ o’ sense and weighty words,And some o’ childish matters.2So I fell to and turn’d them o’er.As they lay a’ like lumber.And dadit aff the dust and stourFrae ilka page arid number.Of ilka piece I took a peep,I view’d their title pages.Just as a herd looks o’er his sheep.To know their health and ages.Here’s Hervey—Milton’s Paradise,The Monk and Hab the Miller,Young’s Love of Fame comes in a trice.And Jack-the-Giant-killer.Here Anson rouild the world sails.There’s Douglas .and Maobeath,Here’s Mother Bunch’s Fairy Tales,There’s Doctor Dod on Death,Here’s —— what is this ! ’tis something new !But wha I wonder’s aught it!It has come here—but when or how;I’m sure I never bought it.Yet mine or no, it’s a’ the sameAs far as I have seen ;The piece is verse, the author’s nameIs Andrew in the Dean.With that I drew in o’er a stool.Sat down afore the ingle.Laid aff my hat, drew on my cowl,And rattled o’er the jingle.Now, Andrew, I’ve read through and throughThe whole of your epistle,And thinks, wha cannot singwi’ youShould be content to whistle.for me, I cannot tnke iir handAright to criticise ye ;But as an answer ye demand,I mean to try and pleas:* ye.But if in this 1 ch oice to fail.Though ye should be offended.Since I’m begun to tell my tale,So I’m a-mind to end it.But poets are a nasty pack.Aye snarling and sneering ;As scon’s a neighbour turns his backHis character they’re tearing.So, Andrew, do not think it strangeTo own me as a brother,For aye ’till ance our natures change.We’ll carp at ane another.So to begin with your address,Which intimates a quarrel;As ye have said so, I confessYe seem a canker'd carle.Your clams are sharp, as ye have said.They prick and scratch us sair;But here perhaps ye’ll find a bladeTo gi’e your nails a pare.I doubt not your intentions may;Be good. But to proceed—The youth ye met yon Sabbath dayHas been a youth indeed:I guess frae a’ the tales he told(Although I do na ken)He’s been a youth of eight years old,Or might be gaen i’ ten4t say yt met with such a youth,And so ye took, occasion,(Because he could not stop your mouthWith arguments and reason)To scandalise a country side.Insult a congregation,And send the rumour broad and wideOf singing folks damnation ! ^Your similie sustains a placeThat never was disputed;For if the fountain’s foul and baseThe stream must be polluted.Hence ye infer, the men that singsCan neither love nor fear ;But who has puddled a’ their springs,And keeped yours so clear ?Are ye more wise and farer seenThan ony other living !That ilka man may close his een,And follow you to Heaven ;To bring the Scriptures on your side,Ye cite them out of season.He who takes sfcriptUrfc for his guide,Should balance truth with reason.For me, I cannot mention halfTh’ absurdities ye bring in,For instance^ what has Aaron’s calfTo do with modern singing ?The braying a&s, the singing bird.And siclike observations ?Should I recite them word for word,’Twould tire the reader’s patience..That tunes have not the Scripture test,Ye seem to be persuadad,And idol worship at the best.By men’s invention added.Such notions, Andrew, are absurd.As I shall show you soon;The Spirit says, who adds a wordyBut not, who adds a tune.There is a fable on record,A servant as ye ken.Who gat five talents from his lorcT,In time repaid him ten.The second took a similar plan,He added two to two.The third received only one—He was a man like you.Now, if we enter any placeWhere there’s a crowd of people.Some men perhaps are singing base.And women singing tnble.While ears and voices, hearts and throats,Go hand in hand together.In unison they swell their notes.And strike with ane anither.But some there be who drones and croons,Minds neither ane nor ither,W ho kens no more of time nor twneSyThen Hackie o’er her fodder.Their voices ne’er were made to sing.Their ear* no notes ctn relish ;And if ye speak of such a thing.They’ll pa’d absurd and foolish.6But why should tufteless folks oppressThe singers with such fury,As if what talents they possess,They ought to hide and bury.Nor should the man for music made-Despise a Christian brother.Because his organ never playedA crotchet, slur, nor quaver./ If singing really be a sin.Then singers merit slander.But if the matter lies within,We ought to judge With candomyLet every man do what he CanTo sing, and praise his Maker jLet them that will not drive be drawn ,The strong should help the weaker.For hark ye what the Scripture says.Though fashions now are changed jLook only back to David’s daysHow matters were arranged.The singers foremost took the lead,The players next forenent themAnd those who cou’dna-keep the threadCame droning up behind them.When Jacob’s son’s from Egypt fled,The sea on foot they cross’d ;Where all their'foes whom Pharaoh ledWere in the Waters lost.When seated on the biher shoreThey sang the Song of MoSes ;No doubt they made a noble choir.So many different voices.7There lasses lilting sweet and shrill*Men singing hoarse and hollow ;Some led the airs with art and skill,While some could only follow*That men o’ sense were there ’tis plain,.And men o’ judgment shallow,And some had tunes, and some had naJust like the folk o’ Fala.And when^that Moses led them throughThe desert for Canaan,There discontented folks like you.Oft vex’d the holy man.Some wantedJlesh, some wanted brtadyAnd something ay was wrang.While others never fash’d their head.But carried on and sang.When Sisera, as stories tell.Had in a tent conceal’d him.When Heber’s wife took up the mall.And to the pavement nail’d him*Then Barak and Debora soonSang to the congregationA song, with a repeating tune.For such a great salvation.Now ye may say they had no tunesrAnd ye may raise a clanger,And ask, was it Sf Paul’s, St JohnOr did they ca’d the Bangor.Or whether sang they fast or slow.However this may be.The Sripture says they sang you know.And that’s enough for me._ 8If thus wc do tri^Scriptures read.It too might be disputedIt fuch a person had a head,bmce nothing’s said about it.There’s many simple things like thatThe Scripture has omitted ;It has not room for idle cha*To please the self-conceited.The man that’s- willing to dispute.He never wants a plea;For instance, ye may ask what fruitWas the forbidden tree.But what is that for you or meTo stand about debating ?The fruit was fruit, the tree a free.And Adam’s sin was eating.To David’s psalms is oft affix’dThe subject they were made on ;Sometimes the tune that suits the text,And whistle it was play’d on.But names o’ times like names of towns.Or man or woman’s name.Will not translate to other tongues,But always stands the same.Yet music in the Hebrew tongueHad quavers,flats, and sharps.Or how could e’er their psalms been sung.Or play’d on flutes or harps.So after a’ that ye have said.Your arguments are frail,The sweetest song that e’er was madeWithout a tune’s a fa/e.9jiut tixjic goes on with rapid fligh,Tlie'i^vheel is always moving.And whether morning, noon, or night,’Tis ours to be improving.So, Andrew, let the young alane,For while you’re stan’ing ta’king,Yu might been past the next mile staneHad ye been busy wa’k.ing.For old and young have each their blots.And fau’ts that need detection.And some improve their neighbour’s spotsTo hide their ain defection.Yet he who most pretends to teachThe road that leads to Canaan,Points to a place he ne’er can resch.While like a guide post stan’ing.Our style in prayer and tunes in praise.Ye say should common be.The man that understands this phraseIs wiser, sir, than me.If this can be a rule completeTo either man or woman.Then we may pray upon the street'Idie practice ance was common ,•The Romish priest has here a propBy such absurd debating.Because ’tis common for the PopeTo say his prayers in Latin.The thing that’s common now-a-daysWas ance a woild’s wonder:And singing tunes in solemn praiseWas held an arrant blunder.TOThe Sti/t and Elgin ance were tunes—pOur Fathers did revere them:But those who dar’d to mint St John'sThey would not sit to hear them.The tunes at which ye startl- now,And absolutely refuse them,Will soon be common though they’re new',If we in common use them.I’m no1 musician, that I grant.Though I can sing a few tunes:I kgfi the French, the Burgher's rant.And twa’r three o’ the new tunes ;Yet I can hear a lively tuneWi’ little molestation.Or if it be an old wife’s croon.It gie’s me no vexation.Yet some there bt who never seek.Instructions from a teacher.But travel two’r three miles a-weekTo criticise Xhe preacher.When by the gospel or the law.They cannot contradict him'.Then the Precenter like a ba’.Out o’er the Desk they’ll kick him.The daisy fair that decks the lee,And violets in the vale.Yields to the wasp and to the bee,A sweet or bitter meal.So tunes and stile, and this and that.Meets the fanatic’s snarl;lie seldom fails to find a faultWho comes to pick a quarrel.11.Religion, Andrew’s like a race.In which we’re call’d to run ;And he that stands or slacks his pace*Can ne’er expect to win.There may be youths, I do not doubt.Or hear ye standing knocking.In meekness, charity, and love.But harder to redeem.The twig in youth is easy bentTo where it should incline.While rugged storms must tear and rend,Old trunks like yours and xaiae.As if the Spirit by the truth.That fills the sacred page.Would paint the piety erf youthThe infamy of age.So he begins in early timesA doleful tale to tell,How by an Elder brother’s crimesThe pious Abel fell.When men and vice went hand in hand,’Till faith could scarce be found,A mighty flood o’erwhelm’d the land,And Adam’s sans were drown’d.An ark prepar’d of pond’rous weight.Upon the waters hung,The number sav’d in it were eight.And six of those were yorna-12Or look we down to Dothan’s plains.Where shepherds dwelt of old,The youngest there of Jacob’s sonsHis Elder brethren sold,When Samuel wa* to Eli sent.The pious youth obeys,And bade the hoary head repentAnd mend his crooked ways.In Nineveh, as we havekeard;What wickedness was done ?Yet see the guilty father spar’d,To save the guiltless son.Or look and list to latter days,There hear the suclcting sing.And infants swell their Saviour's praise.While Elders slew their King.Why therefore should the man of ageThe stripling disregard,Since children are God’s heritage.The womb’s fruit his reward.Let young and old go hand in hand.Our journey still pursue, ♦And when we reach the promis’d land.We’ll sing a song that’s new.THX END.EJinbnrghi Friatrd ky J.

Hutchison & Co. 10, —iSlGTHE BANES OF THE BAN.On Esebeth harbour, that place call’d Hiltown,"Where the rivers & fountains they did me surround;I spied a fair female as you soon shall understand,Was viewing small fishes on the banks of the Ban.I stepped up to her, and to her did 'Say,Kind nature has fram’d you all hearts to betray,But if you will go with me, love, here is my handThat we will be married on the banks of tire Ban.It’s I can’t go with you, young man, she did say,For you ;<re a stranger and would me betray,And I a chaste virgin might break the command.Your absence is a cordial on the banks ohihe Ban.0 at length my persuasions they seem to take place,1 knew from the blushes was seen in her face;Her feet they did slide oh the soft beds of sand;She fell into my arms on the banks of the Ban.But she feeing come to her senses again,And .hen being gall’d with 2 sense of her shame;She cried, you’ve unuoae me, my dear, out of hand,Come let us be marned on the banks of the Ban.Ids I cannot mar y you, for I am a prentice boundTo a voung weaver nigh Rufryland town;But when my trade’s 1 arned, love, here is my hand ;That we wifi be married on the banks of the Ban.It’s since you will not marry me, pray tell me yourname;Or where is your dwelling or from whence you came:My name’s William Engiam on the Elegenstan,My dwelling is near to the bank^ of the Ban.Come all you young maidens wherever you be.That wishes to ponder my sad desth y;When you go a roving by two or hy oreTake care ot the angler who roves on the Ban.THE'SOLDIER’S DREAM.Our bugles had sung, for the night cloud had lower’d,and the centinel stars set the watch in the sky,And thousands had sunk on the ground, over¬power’d;the weary to sleep, and the wounded to die.When reposing that night on my pallet of straw,by the wolf-scaring faggot, and guarding the slain.At the dead of the n'<-ht a 4%&et vision 1 saw,and twice ere the cock crew I iJreamt it again.Methought from the battle-field’s dreadful array,far, far I had roam’d on a desolate track,Till nature and sunshine disclos’d the sweet way' to the house of my father, that welcom’d me back;4*flew to the pleasant fields, traveled so oftin life’s morning march, when my bosom wa§young;I heard my own mountain-goats bleating aloft,and well knew the strain that the corn-reaperssung.Then pledg’d we the wine cup, & fondly we swore,from my hom^ and my weeping friends never topart;My little enes kiss’d me a hundred times o’er,and my wife sobb’d aloud in the fulness of heart.Stay, stay with us, rest, thou art weary and worn,and fain was the war-broken soldier to stay;But sorrow return’d with the dawning of morn,and the voice in my drearning ear melted away.&& ^ ‘Cl <■EDWARD AND MARY.Deep in a vale a cottage stood,oit sought by travellers weary;And long it prov’d the blest abodeof Edward and of Mary.For her be chac’d the mountain goat,o’er Alps and glaciers bounding;For her the chamois he would shoot,dark horrors all surrounding.sBut evening come,He sought his home;And anxious, lovely wcmsn.She hail’d the sight,And every nightT3he cottage rung.As they sung,Oh, duke, duke domutn.But soon, alas! the scene of blisswas chang’d to prospect dreary;For war and honour reus'd each Swiss,and Edward left his Mary,To bold St. G'ubard’s height he rush’d,gainst Gallia’s foes contendirsr,And, by unequal numbers crush’d,he died his defending.The evening come,He sought not home;Whhst she—distracted woman—Goes wild with dread,Now seeks him dead,And hears the knell.That bids farewellTo duke, duice comuna!6The Maid of Erin.My thoughts delight to wanderupon a distant shore,Where, lovely, fair, and tender,is she whom I adore;May Heav’n, its blessings sparing,on her bestow them free,The lovely Maid of Erin,who sweetly sang to me.Had fortune fix’d my station,in some propitious hour,The monarch of a nation,endow’d with wealth and f'ow’r;That wealth and power sharing,my peerless queen shou’m beThe lovely Maid of Erin,who sweetly sang to me.Altho’ the restless oceanmay long between us roar.Yet while my heart has motion,she’ll lodge within its core;For artless and endearing,‘ and mild and young is she,The lovely Maid of Erin,who sweetly sang to me.' ■7When Fate gives intimation,that my last hour is nigh.With placid resignationI’ll lay me down and die;Fond hope my bosom cheering,that I in heav’n shall seeThe lovely Maid of Erin,who sweetly snng to me.*XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXxiXXXXXXXXXXXXPEGGY BAWN.As I came o’er the Highland hills,to a farmer’s house I came;The night being dark, and something v<et>I ventur’d into the same.Where I was kindly treated,and a pretty lass I spied,Who ask’d me if I had a wife?but marriage i denied.I courted her the li’e-lang night,till near the dawn of day,When frankly she to me did say,alang with you I’ll gae;For Ireland is a fine country,and the Scots to you are kin;So I will gang a^ang with you,my fortune to begin.8Day being come, and breakfast o’er,to the parlour I was ra’en;The gudetnan kindly asked me,if I’d marry his daughter Jane?Five hundred merks I’ll give her,besides a piece of lan’;But scarcely had he spoke the word,till I thought of Peggy Bawn.“ Your offer, Sir, is very good,and I thank you too,” said I;“But I cannot be your eon-in-law,and I’ll tell you the reason why;My business calleth me in haste,I am the king’s servant bound,And I must gang awa’ this day,straight to Edinburgh town.”Oh, Peggy Bawy, thou art my owd,thy heart lies in my breast;And though we at a distance are,yet l love thee still the best;Although we at a distance are,and the seas between us roar,Yet I’ll be constant, Peggy Bawn,to thee for 'evermore.FINIS.

He was of thetribe of the Koraflaites, efteenred the nobleft in allthat country, and was defeended in a direft line,from Phor Koraifh, the firft founder of it. Henceit appears, that Mahomet was not of fuch meanparentage as fome have aflerted, being of the no-hleft tribe of all Arabia, and his family the moftconfiderable of that tribe, as having had the chiefrule over it for fevcral defeereu together. How^ever, in the beginning of his life, he was in avery poor and defpicable condition; for his fatherdying before he was two years old, and while hisgrandfather was ftill living, all the power andwealth of his family devolved on his uncles, whdafterwards bore the chief fway in Mecca, underwhofe prote&ion he firft vented his delufions, andwas fupported againft all his oppofers.He lived with his mother till he was eight yearsof ige ; when (he died, his grand father took him;but he dying foon after, Mahomet was committedto the jeare of one of his uncles, who being a greatmerchant, brought him up in the mercantile way.He continued with his uncle till twenty-fiveyears of age, when one of the principal men ofthe city died and left all h.is ftock, which wasA 2 very■ i4 The HISTORY ofvery confiderable, to fits widow, who wanted afaftor to manage it for her, invited Mahomet toher fervice. During three years time, wherein hetraded for her at Damafcus and other places, heacquitted himfelf lb honourably, and fo far gainedthe favour and good opinion of his miftrefs, thatfhe married him in the twenty-eighth year of hisage; and thus from the condition of a fervant,ihe advanced him to be mafter both of her perfonand eftate. By this means, being rendered equalin wealth to the greateft in the city ; his ambitionmade him afpire to the fovereignty which his an-ceftors had enjoyed, and of which he himfelf hadbeen deprived, only by being an orphan beforethe death of his grand-fathcr.His trading into Egypt, Paleftine, and Syria,made him well acquainted both with Jews andChriftians; and obferving that each of them weredivided into feveral fe£ts, he concluded that no¬thing would be more likely to raife him a party,and to accomplilh his defigns, than the framingand advancing of a new religion. For fuch a changehe judged the" inhabitants of Mecca might be welldifpofed, as their traffic and frequent converfewith the Chridians had abated fomewhat of theiraeal for that grofs idolatry, co which they hadbeen hitherto addi£led; and at the fame time,they were falling from Heathenifm to Zcndichiim,an error much like that of the Sadducees amongthe Jews, as denying the refurre&ion and a futureBate : He therefore betook himfelf to frame fucha religion as he thought would be moll eafily fwal-Jowed by thefe be had to deal with : and hisfcheme being a medley of Judailm, and Chridi-anity; the herefiesof the eaflern Chriftians at thattime, and the old Pagan rites of the Arabs, toowellMAHOMET. swell anfvrering his- intention, and gained himiprafelytes among all forts of people-i However, that he might not immediate!)' turnpreacher agaiad that idolatry which he had hi-iltherto pradiifed with his fellow citizens, and with-; out fome previous change, take upon him the: character of a reformer and a prophet, fo unfuita-b!e to his wicked and licentious courfe of life; inthe thirty-eighth year o? his age he began to affectretirement, and withdrew every morning into a! foiitary cave near Mecca, where he pretended to; fpend his time in faffing, prayer and meditation ji and there it is fuppofed he had hi* firlt confulta-, tions with thofe who helped him to compofe hisAlcoran. His nrff attempt was to draw his wifeinto a belief of his impoliure; and in order tothis, when he returned home at night from the: cave, he ufed to tell her of vifions he had feen,and ftrange voices he had heard;, but {he rejeiredthofe (lories as the vain fancies of a diffurbed i-; imagination, or elfe the delufions of fome evilI fpirit. ..He farther pretended a converfe witii theangel Gabriel; which fhe was as backward to be¬lieve as the other, till having advifed with a fu-; gitire Monk they then kept in the houfe, whoi was concerned with Mahomet in the contrivance,ij be brought her to be perfuaded of the truth of ailcl her huffaand had told her, and that he was reallyr" called to the p:ophctick office; and thus (he be-: came his ffrft profelyte.Having now, by living two years in a retired; and auffere manner, gained, as he thought, a fuf-ij ficient reputation of landfity for carrying on hisi delign ; in the fortieth of his age hs begani to take upon him tbe title of the “ ApofUc o£i God,” and to propagate his new religion 5 butthis he d*d in private for the firll four years, and■A 3 only6 The HISTORY ofonly air!or;g fuch as were his acquaintance and!confidents. His fecond profelyte was his flare j,and, the third, his coufin. Mahomet’s fouith dif-ciple, was a very rich man in Mecca, and being;a perfon of wifdom and experience, gave his caufeino fmail reputation ; and his example was foon:followed by five others, who were afterwards theprincipal generals of his armies, and contributedvery much to the eflablifhment of his empire anddofh’ine in thofe parts of the world.After he had gained thefe nine profelytes, hebegan openly to publifh his impeflure to the peo¬ple of Mecca, in the forty-fourth year of his age *and to declare himfelf a prophet fenr by God U*reduce them from the error of Paganifm, and toteach them the true religion He did not pre¬tend to deliver to them a new one, but to revivfc:the old one, which God firfl gave to Adam;,and, after it had been loft in the corruption ofmankind, reftored it by revelation to Abraham*who taught it his fon Iftmiael their forefather.Addhrg, that Ifhmael, when he firft planted him¬felf in Arabia, inftrufted the people-in the famereligion he hod received from Abraham ; buttheir pofteriry aftewards corrupted it into idola¬try, which God had now' fent him to deftroy,and once again to reftore the religion cf Ifttmati-Therefore, according to his own account, theJews do not improperly call the religion of Ma¬homet by the name of Iftnapaehfm.Mahomet, allowed both the Old and New Tes¬taments, and that Mafes and Jefus Chrift were' prophets fent frong God ; but affirmed, that thejews and >Chrfftians had corrupted thefe holywritings, from which corruptions he was fent topurge them,"'to reftore the law of God to its ori¬ginal purity; and therefore the moft of the paf.MAHOMET. 7Pages which he quotes out of the Scriptures aremuch different in the Alcoran from what we findin our Bibles, and are artfully adapted to fupporthis own delufions.He pretended to receive all his revelations fromthe angel Gabriel, who he faid was lent from God,for that purpofe. And whereas he was fubjeftto the falling (icknefs ; whenever he had a fit,he faid k was>a trance, occafioned by the bright-nefs df the angel’s appearance, who then came tocommunicate to him fome new revelation. Thefepretended revelations he put into feveral chapters,the collection of which makes up the Alcoran, orBible of the Mahometans; and taught them thattheoriginal of this book was laid up in the archieresof heaven, and thatthe angel brought him the co¬py of it chapter by chapter, according as occafioarequired they fhould be publifhed to the people.On his firft appearing publickly as a prophet,the people laughed at him ; and fome called himI Magician, Liat, Impoftor, and the like oppro-ibrious names, of which he often complains ini the Alcoran; fo that for a year or two he made'very little progrefs, and fcarce met with any thingbut fcors and contempt for his pains. This how¬ever, did not difeourage him from purfuing hisIdefign, u'hich he did in a manner the moft likelyito obtain fuccefs: for he was a man of ready wir,and very engaging addrefs, bearing all affronts,(•without flhewing the leaft refentment; and knewifcow to apply himfelf to all forts and degrees ofipeople, foothing the rich with praife and flattery,rand gaining the affedfions of the poor, by reliev-ling their neceflities. In a word, by an artful andtirifinuating behaviour, he at length furmountedlithe difficulties that flood in his way; fo that in;the fifth year of his pretended million, hia partywas8 The HI STORY ofwas iocreafed to forty, himfelf included, manyof them perfons of wealth and reputation, whofeexample was likely to have a confiderable inlla-ence over their fellow citizens.The inhabitants of Mecca began now to be a-larmed at his progrefs; thofe that were zealousfor the idolatry of their forefathers oppoling hin**s an enemy of their gods, and a dangerous in¬novator of their religion : And others, who fawfarther into his fchemes were fenfible they tendedto deflroy the public liberty, and to eftablilh atyranny over them ; and therefore combined to¬gether to take him oft by violence. But his unclefound moans to defeat the defigns of his enemies jand by his power, being chief of the tribe, pre-ferved him from all attempts that were formed a-gaiuil him : for though he himfelf perilfted in thePaginifm of bis anceftors, yet he had fo gre it anaffe£tion for the impoftor, as being his kinfman,end educated chiefly in his own houfe, that hefirmly fupported him againft all his oppofers. Un¬der his protetfion therefo:* Mahomet went boldlyon to preach to the people in the publick place*of the city, and to publith his revelations, as hepretended they were brcSight him from time totime by the angel Gabriel.The main arguments he made ufe of to deludemen into a belief of his impofture, were hifthreats and promifes, as being thof. which mofleafily work upon the minds of the vulgar. Hirpromifes were chiefly of a p .radife, which hecunningly framed as to make it confsft wholly ofuch pleafures and delights as were heft fuited tcthe talle of the Arabians;, a people living wlthirthe Torrid Zone, who by the nature of their cli¬mate, as well as the corruption of their mannersMAHOMET. 9and would not fail of being captivated with hopesof rivers and ftreams of water, cooling drinks,(haded gardens, delicious fruits, and other en¬joyments of that kind, which to them, were par¬ticularly defirable, on account of the fcorchingheat and drynefs of their country. Accordingly he:ells his followers, “They lhall enter into plea-‘ fant gardens, watered by rivulets and fouts-tains, near which they {hall repofe themfelves* upon the foftefl beds, adorned with all man-‘ ner of precious ftones, under the {hade of trees* that fhall continually yield all manner of the‘ moft agreeaWe fruits •, and that there they fhall‘ enjoy women ever young and beautiful, with1 large black eyes, and complexions always frefh* and charming as polifhed pearls; in whofe1 company they {hall folace themfelves with a-!J morous delights to all eternity, drinking like-f wife the moft delicious wines and other li-i' quors, without ever being intoxicated or over-lf charged thereby, which {hall be fyved up toi[ them by beautiful boys in cups of gold andr glaftes fet with diamonds,” &c. And with thepme kind of fublility he defcribed the punilh-pents of hell which he threatened to all that/ould not believe in his miffion, to confift in fuchprments as muft appear to them-moft grievousbnd affli&ing; telling them, “That they {hall|i fuffer an unconceirable thirft, and fhould haveH, nothing to drink but boiling and {linking wa-Iter; that they {hould dwell for ever in conti¬nual fire, and be futrounded with a black hot,and fait fmoke; that they fhpuld eat nothingbut briars and thorns and the fruit of the treeZacon, which ftiould be in their bellies likeburning pitch;” and other frightful ftones ofe fame nature. Thus fome w^ere allured, and o-theriIO The HISTORY ofthers terrified to embrace his new fyftem of re¬ligion.To thefe motives he added, (th<t nothing mightbe wanting), the threats of grievoos puniihmentaand judgments in this life, as well as in thatwhich is to come, if they would not hearken to Jhis dofitrine. To this end, he took all oppor¬tunities of reprefenting to them the terrible de-ftru£fioh that had overtaken fuch as refufed toliften to the prophets fent before him : How thedeluge came upon the old world: Sodom wasdeftroyed by fire, and the Egyptians were for*affii£l:ed with various plagues, for their contempt |and difobcdience to Noah, Lot, and Mofes; andhow Ad and Thamor, two ancient tribes of the 1Arabians, (as, he on purpofe feigned), were to¬tally extirpated for the fame reafon. On account jof fuch (lories as thefe, which he frequently in¬culcated to the people, his enemies called him \“ A teller of old Fables j” but by thefe artifices,his party continued to increafe, which was atlad joined by two of his uncles, though feveralsof them continued to oppofe him, as a man whocarried on defigns that tended to the prejudice ofhis country.But that which grieved him mod was, thatbis oppofers required him to work a miracle j** For, faid they, Mofes, Jefus, and the other*'* prophets, wrought miracles to prove that theirmiffions was divine, and therefore if thou artu a praphet, and greater than, any that were fent“ before thee, as thou boaded thyfelf to be, de-mondrate it to us by the fame lort of proof:Raife the dead, caufe the dumb to fpeak, andc‘ the deaf to hear, and then we will believew thee.” This objection, he endeavoured to e-vade, or anfwer divers ways j but his mod con-iiderabl*MAHOMET. nfidcrable reply was, “ That their predecefibrs hadcontemned the miracles of Saleh, and the o-*« thcr prophets, and therefore God would work“ no more amongft them.” At another time hewould infill, “ That thofe whom God had or-dained to believe, would believe without mi-** racles, and thofe that he had not ordained,*would never be convinced by that kind of evi-“ dence ; and that therefore, they were entirelyneedlefs:” Bbt none of his rcafons being fa-tisfa6tory, as plainly confefling he had not thepower of working miracles, with which otherprophets were endowed/'he was deferted by ma-i ny of his followers.Finding all his fophiltry too weak, on his re-I tiring to Medina, another city of Arabia, he tookI the fword in his hand, and having got an armyi to back his caufe, fie foon changed his note; for[then he pretended, “That fince God had fent|“ Mofes and Jefus with miracles, and men wouldnot hearken to their doftrine, he had now'!“ fent him in the laft place without miracles, toe< force them to obedience by the power of thefword.’ Purfuant hereto, he forbade his dif-iciples to enter into any further difputes about hisurcligion, and commanded them to deftroy all wholoppofed it, promifing great rewards in a futurelllate to fuch as would take up arms in its defence,land that thofe who died in the caufe fhouid have• a crown of martyrdom.On this head the Mahometan do&ors arguecunningly enough in the following manner: Theprophets of God, fay they, are of divers forts,according to the divers attributes of his divinelature, which they are fent to Ihew forth to thevorld. Thus Jefus Chrift was fent to manifelthe Kightcoufnefs, the Power, and the Know-12 The HISTORY ofledge of God; the firft of which he did accord¬ingly in his being implacable, i e. in the ftate ofa perfon who cannot fin ; the fecond, in workingthofe miracles which none but a divine powercould effeft ; and, the third, in that he knew thefecrets of men’s hearts, and foretold things toCome. In like manner, Solomon was fent to ma*nifeft the Wifdom, the Glory, and the Majeftyof God; and Mofes, to (how his Providence andhis clemency ; none of whom having a‘ powsr toforce men to believe, miracles were neceffary toconvince them of the truth of their miflions: butMahomet, fay they, was a prophet fent prin¬cipally to manifeft the fortitude of God by thepower of the fword ; which alone being fufficientto compel men to the faith, he wrought no mi¬racles, as not wanting their afMance to accom-plilh the will of heaven. Hence it hath becomethe univerfal dotfrine of the Mahometans, thattheir religion is to be propagate by the fword, andall the faithful (Mahometans) are bound to fightin its defence.In the eighth year of his pretended miffion, hiparty growing formidable at Mecca, the citizenspafled a decree, whereby they dire&ly forbade cvery one to follow him for the futuie. This pro*hibition did him no prejudice during the life o:his uncle ; but he dying two years after, and the!)chief government of the city falling into the handof one who violently oppo ed Mahomet, all hienemies laid hold of this advantage to renew theiroppofition againft him ; which they did with fuchifuccefs, that they foon put a flop to the progrefaof his impofture at Mecca, and he was alfo de*|ferted by many of his difciples.Mahomet’s aim all along was to have gainefuch a party at Mecca, as to have made himfelmafteCMAHOMET. 13.matter of the whole city, and from thence to havearmed his followers in order to reduce the reft ofArabia. To this purpofe it was that he fo ofteninculcated to them, that ali who received thefaith he preached, mutt fight for it, and that hisdo&rine was to be propagated by the fword-:•but having no hopes of accomplifhing this his de-fign at Mecca, his thoughts were employed ongoing to fome other town that might be morecommodious for carrying on his projects. Withthis view he took a journey to Tayif, a town a-bout forty miles from Mecca, where one of hisuncles refided, who had a very confiderable in-tereft among the inhabitants. Under his pro¬tection he thought to have fpread his delufions,and at length to have got pofleflion of the place*but after a month’s flay, not having been able togain one profdyte, he returned to Mecca, thereto wait a more favourable opportunity of pur-fuing the fchemes he had projected.About this time his firft wife died, after fhehad lived with him two and twenty years; hemarried two other wives, and foon alter he tooka third; whereby making himfelf fon-in-law tothree of the principal men of his party, he at¬tached them the more firmly to his interett.In the twelfth year of his pretended piiffioq isplaced the Mifra, that is, his famous night’s jmlr-ney from Mecca to Jerufalem, and from thenceto Heaven; of which he gives the following ac¬count:One night as he lay in bed with his heft belov¬ed wife, he heard a knocking at the door, where¬upon arifing and opening it, he found there theangel Gabriel with feventy pair of wings expan-B ded,14 The HIS TORT oftied, whiter than fnow, and clearer than chryftal, ,and the beaft Alborak (landing by him, oh which, |fays he, the prophets ufed to be carried from wplace to place to execute any divine command. |This beaft Mahomet defcribes to be as white as |milk, cf a mixed nature between an afs and a |.mule, but not quite fo big as the latter, and as |fwift as lightning, which the word Alborak fig- |nifies in the Arabick language. On Mahomet’s ljappearing at the door, the angel faluted him with |a pleafant countenance, telling him he was fent to !bring him to heaven, where he (hould fee ftrange jimyfteries, not lawful to be feen by any other man, jand ordered him to mount Alborak ; but the beaft Mbeing wanton and (kittiftt with idienefs, having .refted from the time of Chrift till now, wouldnot (land (till for ^Vlahomet for to get upon hisback, till he had firft foothed him by promifingbim a place in paradife} whereupon having quiet¬ly mounted, the angel leading the way with thebridle in his hand, he was carried in the twink¬ling of an eye from Mecca to Jerufalem. On his |coming thither, all the departed prophets andfaints appeared at the gate of the temple to fa-lute him ; and attending him to the chief orato¬ry, defired him to pray for them, and then de¬parted ; whereupon Mahomet and the angel going jout of the temple, found there a ladder of light Lready fixed for them, which they immediately af-cended, leaving Alborak tied to a rock till theirreturn.On their arrival at the firft heaven, and Gabri¬el’s knocking and informing the porter who wasthere, the gates, which Mahomet defcribes to beof a prodigious fize, were immediately opened.MAHOMET. isThis firft heaven, he tells us, was all of puie fil-▼er j and the ftars, each as big as a large moun*tain, hung from it by chains of gold ; and thatangds kept watch in thefe {tars, to prevent theapproach of evil fpiriis. Here he faw a decrip-ed old man, our firit father Adam it feems,who faluting him, gave God thanks for fo great ar-fon, and then recommended himfelf to his pray¬ers. In the fame heaven he alfo faw a multitudeof angds in all manner of fliapes, viz. of men,beads, and birds; and among the laft faw a cock,white as fnow, of fuch a prodigious bignefs, thathis feet {landing upcn the firft; heaven, his headreached up to the fecond, which was at the dif-tance of live hundred years journey according to-our ufual rate of travelling. Others fay, his headreaches up through all the feven heavens, as faras the throne of God, which is above feven timeshigher ; that his wings are adorned with carbun¬cles and pearls,, and extended eaft and weft, to adiftance anfwerable to his height. This, faysMahomet, Gabriel told me was the chief angelof the cocks; and that every morning, God fing-ing an hymn, this cock conftantly joined him bycrowing, which is fo loud, that all (except menand fairies) hear it in heaven and in earth, andthen all other cocks crow alfo. The Mahome¬tans fay, “ That the voice of one reading in theii Alcoran, of him who early every morning praysfor pardon of his fins, and the voice of the“ cock, are three voices which God always hearswith acceptance.”From the firft heaven, the impoftor tells us, heafcended u*p to the fecond, at the diftance of fivehundred years jpurne.y above it, whh|h he makesB 2 to1(5 Thi HISTORY ofto be the height of each of the feven heavens abovethe other. In this heaven, which was of puregeld, he faw Ncab, who congratulated him, anddefined his prayers: And here he alfo faw twiceas many angels as before, one of them fo large,-that as he flood on the fecund heaven, his headreached up to the third. .Hence he afeended to the third heaven, madeof precious ftones; at the entrance of which hemet Abraham, who likewife defired the favourcf his prayers; and here he faw a ftill greaternumber of angels, and one among them of fuch.a very enoimous fize, that the tiiflance betweenhis two eyes was feventy thoufand days journey.  (Here the ingenous Dr. Prideaux obferves,Mahomet was out of his mathematicks, for thediftance between a man's eye’s, being in proportionto his height, but as one to feventy two, at thisrate the height of the angel muft have been four¬teen thoufand years journey, which is four timesas much as the height of all his heavens put to¬gether.) This the angel Gabriel informed himwas the angel of Death ; for he had a large tablebefore him, whereupon he is continually writingthe names of all that are born into the world,computes the days of their life, and when he findsthey have ccmpleated their number afiigned them,he blots out their names, and the perfons do thenimmediately die.From thence he then proceeded to the fourthheaven, which was all of emerald, where he metwith Jofeph the fon of Jacob, who defired a fharein his prayers alfo. Here were ftill a greaternumber of angels than in the former heaven} oneMAHOMET, \jof whom, much larger than the reft, was perpe'tually weeping and lamenting, which, as Gabriel,informed Mahomet, was for the the fins of men,,f and their deftruclion confequent thereupon.In the fifth heaven, which he tells us was made| of Adamant, he found Mofes, who alfo bcfought-! him to intercede with God in his behalf: and[ here he faw a much greater number of angels' than in any of the former ftages.On his entering into the fixth heaven, whichfays he, was all of carbuncle, he met with John;the liaptift, who likewife commended himfelf to*his prayers ; and here the number of angels wa*greater than in any of the former heavens.From thence he afeended up to the feventh hea»ven, which was all made of divine light, wherehe found Jefus Cbrilt, vtfhofe prayers, Mahomethimfelf, as he tells us, delired ; hereby intimat¬ing Jefus Chrift to be the greater, in order toflatter and pleafe the ChrilUans, and thereby todraw them the more eafily into his impoiture.Here he faw more angels than in all the otherheavens put together, and among them, a veryextraordinary one, having feventy thoufand heads,and in every head as many tongues, and everytongue uttering, as many diftintt voices at once,i which he continued day and night, iuctftaatiy;prailing and glorifying the great Creator.The angel Gabriel, having brought Mahomet-thus far, told him, That ee, for his own part, wasnot permitted to go any farther j but direded Ma¬homet to afeend up the reft of the way himfelf to3 the-18 The HISTORY cftbe throne of God: In ■which paffage, Mahomet |fays he wrent through water, fnow, ?.nd fuch o-ther difficulties, till he came where he heard a |voice faying untm him, O Mahomet ! falute thyCreator ! From hence afcending ftill higher, hecame to a place of vaft extenfion of light, of fuchbrightnefs as could not be endured, which, as Ma¬homet fays, was the habitation of the Almighty,where his throne was: On the right fide where- Rof, fays he, was an Arabic infcriptioif to the fol- Ilowing purpofe, “ There is no God but God, and“ Mahomet is his prophet.” This is the Ma¬hometan Creed, and he tells us, that this inscrip¬tion was written on all the gates of the feven |lheavens.The impoftor adds, That approaching the pre¬fence of God within two bow {hots, he faw himfitting upon his throne with a covering of feventytboufaiui v. il? before bis face : that God put forthhis hand, in'token of his favour, and laid it uponM ahomet, vhichwasof thjt exceeding coldnels,that it pierced the very marrow of his back, andhe could not bear it. Thar after this, God con-verfed familiarly with him, revealed to him agreat many hidden myfleries, and made him un--derftand his whole law, and hew' he would havethe world infirufUd in the knowledge of it: And,in fine, gave him feveial privileges above the reftof mankind.^ f * Ix.^eirg then difrrifTed, he returned to the angelGj.bricl, who reccndufled him through all theheavens the fame way that he came, let him u-pcn the beaft Aiborak, which they had left tiedat Jerufakm, and from thence, with the bridleiaMAHOMET. 19in his hand, brought him back again to Mecca*and all this in the 1’pace of one tenth part of anight, as Mahomet himfdf affirms.When he came to relate this extraordinary fic¬tion to the people next morning, it was received,as it deferved, with general contempt and deri-j fion j and, many of his difciples, as afhamed of, him, as an abominable liar, left him on this oc«1 cafion. Others would have followed their exam¬ple, had not one of his principal followers put aflop to the defection, by his avouching and pro-feffing his belief of the whole ftory : for whichextraordinary fervice, he acquired the title of Af-fudic, or the Juft. And this fi£Uon is now asfirmly believed by the Mahometans as we believe! the gofpel; only, it feems it was .once difputed,J whether this was a vifion or a real journey ; buttheir doflors have iat length, after fome deputa¬tion, refolved it to be a real journey.However ridiculous this ftory might at firft ap¬pear, Mahomet in the end gained great advantageI from it; for after it came once to be believed,1 all his fayings palled for facred truths broughtdown from heaven, and every word that droppedfrom him, and every action relating to his reli¬gion, was carefully obferved. Thefe being re-1 duced to writing after his death, make up thefe[( volumes of traditions which the Mahometan* callI the Sonna, and which among them is the lame asj the Oral Law was among the Jews. And as thej Jews had their books in which their Oral Lawjij was recited, explained and digefted under feveraiI heads and chapters by many different authorities;fo are there great numbers of books among thei . Maho-/2a ihcHiSTonrofMahometans concerning their Sonna, in whichaii the acts and fayings of Mahomet, relating tohis religion, are recorded and commented upon,which books make up the whole cf theii theology,as well fpeculative as prartical.The’ the publication of the above mentionedfirtion confiderably weakened Mabemet’S party inand about Mecca \ and feveral of them fcr fomepractices againft the governmenr, were forced to1fly into-Ethiopia, yet thefe Ioffes were foon com-penfated by the profelytes which he gained atMedina, which was inhabited partly by jews, andpartly by Chriftians, who perfecuted one anotherwith great violence ; and one of the contendingparties, in order to ftrengtheH themfelyes, fell inwith Mahomet, and it is generally fuppofed to be-the Chriftians, from the kindnefs that the inrwpoftor (hewed at firit to the profeffors of Chrifti’*anity, and his very barbarous and inhumag treat¬ment of the Jews. But be that as it may, in thethirteenth year of Mahomet’s pretended miffion,there came feventy-three men and two womenfrom Medina to Mahomet at Mecca, and embrac¬ed his religion ; out of which number he chofetwelve, and having given them proper inftruc-tions, fent them back again to their own countryto propagate his dortrine; in which they labour¬ed with fuch fuccefs, that they foon brought overgreat part of the inhabitants.At the fame time, Mahomet and his followers'at Mecca, met with nothing but oppofition anddifcouragement, and the government of that ci¬ty, looked upon the impoftor with (uch a jealous-eye, that a defign was artually laid to have fur-prifedMAHOMET. 21prlfed and cut him cff; but he having receive^timely intelligence of it, fled from thence withall his difciples; and notwithflanding feveral par-: ties v/ere fent out to purfue and apprehend him,he efcaped them by hiding himfelf fome confide-rable time in a cave, and at lalt got fafe to Me¬dina, where he was received by his friends withloud acclamations of joy. He lodged for fometime at firfi. in the houfe of one of the chief ofhis profelytes in that place; but he built him¬felf a houfe very foon after, where he ufually re-,fided as long as he lived, and eredfed a mofqueadjoining to it for the public excrcife of his re¬ligion.Mahomet, having now fixed himfelf at Medi¬na, gave his daughter Fatima in marriage to hiscoufin Ali, the fon of his deceafed uncle. Shebeing the only child then living of fix, which heij had by his firll wife; and indeed the only one thatI furvived him, notwithftanding the many wivesithat he took ; and from her alone all thofe derivetheir pedegree, which pretend are of the family:i of Mahomet. Her father ufed to reckon her amongi the moft perfedl of. women, and of which fort he;li held that there were never more than four fromtl the beginning of the world; and thofe, fays Ma-i hornet, were Afiah, the wife of Pharaoh, the1 Virgin Mary, Cadigna his own wife, and hisI daughter Fatima.The impoftor being now mafler of a very con-fiderable town, and having got together a body oftroops, made no fcruple to pull off the maik, and|i inflead of ufing arguments any longer to bring the^people over to his opinion, he now made it deathtor*2 The HISTORY offor a»y one in the lead to oppofe or contradi£l hi$doflrine } commanding all his faithful difciples toarm themfelves and to fight for it, rather than todifpute about it, and he commanded that theyfhould fpare none that did not embrace it, or fub*mit to pay a tribute for the redemption of theirlives, or indulgence in their infidelity. And ac-cogdingly in mod Mahometan countries, to thisvery day, the inhabitants of a different perfuafionpay a certain tax or duty for being tolerate in th«exercife of their religion.The firft enterprizes of Mahomet, after his tak¬ing up the fword, look more like fo many rob¬beries than warlike expeditions; much lefs arethey confident with his fpecious pretence of fight¬ing for the caufe of God. He began by orderingone of his uncles with a party of thirty horfe, tointercept and plunder the caravan of Mecca, thatwas on the road in their return from Syria. This |officer accordingly podcd himfelf in a wood, near Swhich they were to pafs, but on their approach, 1finding them guarded by thnte hundred men fentfrom Mecca for that purpofe, he thought it modprudent to let them alone, and return to Medina.Several other expeditions of the fame kind wereundertaken the fame year, and with much aboutthe fame fuccefs.The next year, (A. D. 623) Mahomet marchedin perfon with three hundred and twenty men toattack a rich caravan travelling from Mecca to¬wards Syria, with a vad deal of money and mer-chandife; but coming up with them, he foundthem guarded by a convoy of a thoufand men,whereupon a fierce battle enfued. The victory,.whichMAHOMET. 23which remained a long time defperate and doubt"ful, at the length fell to the fide ot Mahomet; butthe caravan made fo good a retreat, that they far¬ed a good part of their baggage. However Maho»met’s troops gained a very confiderable booty,which had like to have been the occafion of breed¬ing a fatal quarrel among them: for the army con«filting of two parties, the men of Medina, who hadI given him fo kind a reception, and thofe of Mec¬ca, who had been the companions of his flight,the former infilling on a larger lhare than the lat¬ter. In order to put an end to this controverfy,Mahomet thought proper to compofe the eighthchapter of his Alcoran; whereby he allots thefifth part of the fpoil to himftlf, and the reft toj; be equally divided between the contending parties.The very extraordinary fuccefs of this a£Hon,againlt an enemy fo much fupe/ior as to numbers,gave Mahomet and his followers great encourage-.ment. He frequently boafts of it in his Alcoran,and would have it to be believed that two miracles1 were wrought for him on that occafion. Thell! firft, fays Mahomet, was, “ That God made his"I army appear much more numerous to his ene-‘j1 u mies than it was in reality, which much damp-|! u ed their courage:” And the fecond was, “ ThatI “ he fent troops of angels to his afliftance, which| “ contributed greatly towards his vi£lory.” Toj] make his fuccefs to look the more miraculous, Ma¬rl hornet multiplies the forces that he fought againft:jjto three thoufand men, befides the drivers: but( the credit of this great odds Hands upon no other(foundation than that of his own fingle teftimony.In the year, (A. D. 624) Mahomet made warupon24 The BISTORT ofupon feme tribes of the Arabs that pretended tobe of the Jewifh religion; and after feveral bloodyand defperate engagements, with various fuccefieson both fides, Mahomet at laft having taken theirfortified places, and made many of them prifoners,he fold them for flaves, and divided their effedtsamong his foldiers and followers. But towardsthe end of the year, Mahomet received a very fig-nal defeat, which reduced his affairs to a low con¬dition ; for the people of Mecca, in order to re-'venge the laft year’s affront, marched againft Ma¬homet with an army of three thoufand foot, andtwo hundred horfe ; and having feized upon amountain, only four miles diftance from Medina, 'they fo diftreffed the town from thence, that Ma¬homet, though he could mufter no more than athoufand men, was forced to hazard a battle, inorder to diflodge them from that important poft,at the firft onfet Mahomet had the advantage, butbeing at laft overpowered by the enemy’s numbers, |he loft many of his men; and among the reft his |flandard bearer. The Impoftor himfelf received |feveral dangerous wounds, and would probably |have loft his life, had not two of his companions jcome in timely to his affiftance j in which a£tionhe received a wound in his hand, that deprivedhim ever after of the ufe of feme of his fingers.From this ill fnccefs, the people of Medina, be¬gan to argue that Mahomet was no prophet, norfo much in favour with God, as he pretended ;and others murmured, and were ready to mutiny,on account of their friends and relations that werekilled in the battle. To filence the former he toldthem, “ That his defeat was occafioned by the fins“ of fome in his army, and for this reafon God“ permittedMAHOMET. 2 s** permitted him to be vanquifhed And to op-pofe the clamours and complaints of the latter, heintroduced his do&rine of Predeftination, tellingthem, “ That as for thofe who were flain in the“ late battle, their fate was inevitable; and that“ if they had remained at home in their houfes,“ they mull have died when they did, the period“ of every#man’s life being abfolutely fixed and“ predetermined of God, beyond which time it“ could not polfibly be prolonged But for theircomfort, he added, “ That as they died fighting“ for the faith, they had obtained the crown of** martyrdom, .and were now alive with GodwinParadife in a ftate of everlafting blifs, which“ was infinitely to be preferred before this life,<( and all the fatisfa£lion the world afforded.”And thefe do&rines he found fo ftrengthened thecourage and refolution of his difciples, that hedid not fail to inculcate them ever after.The next year Mahomet made war upon a tribeof Jewifh Arabs in the neighbourhood of Medi¬na, whom he forced to fly towards Syria ; but aparty of his troops overtaking them near theborder qf that country, put them every man tothe fword, one only excepted, who had the goodfortune to efcape. The fame year he fought afecond battle, and had many other Ikirmilheswith thofe that refufed to fubmit to him, whichwere attended with various fuccefs.In one of thefe expeditions, feme of his officers,being heated with liquor and deeply engaged inplay, fell out amongft themfelvcs, and had veryrfEar fuined his affairs; and therefore, for pre¬venting the like mifehief, he prohibited his fol¬lowers the ufe of wine, and all games of chanceC forThe HISTORY offor the future. To give thisprohibition the great¬er weight, he invented a fable of two angels, whohe tells us were in times pad fent down fromheaven to adminifter jullice, and teach men righ-teoufnefs in the province of Babylon: that whilethey were there, a certain woman invited themto dinner, and fet wine before them, which Godhad forbidden them to drink ; but venturing totranfgrefs the divine command, they became fointoxicated, that they tempted the woman tolewdnefs; who promifed to confent on conditionthat one of them (liould firfl carry her to heaven,and the ether bring her back again This beingagreed to, when the woman got to heaven, {herefufed to return, and declared to God the wholematter; whereupon, as a reward of her virtue,{he was made the morning ftar, and the angelswere feverely puniftied, by being hung up by thefeet in a tieep pit near Babylon till the day ofjudgment.■The next year VA. 'D. 626.) Mahomet was ingreat danger of being totally undone; for thepeople of Mecca having made an alliance with fe-veral tribes of Jewifh Arabians, marched againfthim with an army of ten thoufand men. Maho¬met advanced to meet them, but finding himfelfnot in a condition to give them battle, on accountof their fuperior numbers, he thought fit to in-trench,*and was in a manner befieged by the e-nemy in his camp. While the twm armies lay fonear each other, he found means to corrupt fomeof the enemies officers, who took all opportuni¬ties of fowing diffeofion among the confederates,and at laft, by their advice and example, pre¬vailed upon them to retreat and feparate: andthus, this expedition, from which Mahomet hadM A H O M E T. 27fo much to fear, ended in the lofs of only fix m«non his fide and three on the other.Mahomet knew very well how to make ufe ofthe advantage the enemy had given him by thisretreat, he immediately marched againft one of theconfederate tribes, laying fiege to their ftrong pla¬ces, and forcing them to furrender at difcretioji.Moft of the men were put to the fword, the wo¬men and children fold for flaves, and the bootyhe divided among his foldiers.He likewife fubdued feveral other tribes of theArabians, treating them for the moft part in thefame cruel manner ; but finding among the cap¬tives, a woman of extraordinary beauty, he fellin love with her, and made her his wife, and forher fake he releafed all her relations who had-been taken prifoners.Having gained many vi&ories, and confiderablyincreafed his forces, Mahomet now refolved toreturn the vifir to his enemies at Mecca ; and abattle was fought between them near that city, in1 which, no great advantage being obtained on ei¬ther fide, a truce was concluded, whereby it was*agreed, “ That all who were friends to Mahomet“ in Mecca, might have liberty of joining him,and thofe in his army, who defired it, might^ return to their houfes at Mecca : and that Ma-“ hornet, or any of his party, fhculd be permit-c‘ ted to come into the city at any ttmeduring thei ** truce, and to remain there for three days, pio-“ vided they came without arms, and in a peace.“ able manner.”The impoftor on his return to Medina, lookingupon his authority to be pretty well eftablilhed,caufed his army to proclaim him king under a treecifzS The HISTORY ofnear that city. He. retained however, the officecf chief prieft of his religion, and tranfmittedboth the regal and pontifical fun£tions to his fuc-ceffbrs, which continued fo for near 300 years af¬ter his death, when the governors ot the fcveralprovinces of the empire aflumed the regal autho¬rity, and left the Caliph nothing but the prieft-bood.When Mahomet had finifhed his mofque at Me¬dina, he ufed to officiate in it himfelf; prayingand preaching to the people, as he leaned upon apiece of a beam or flump of a tree, driven into theground for that purpofe; but being now advanc¬ed to the regal dignity, he did not think this ac¬commodation fuitable to his grandeur; and there¬fore by the advice of one of his wives, he caufeda pulpit to be ere£led, with a feat in it, fromwhence he afterwards harangued the audience.Hereupon, fay the Mahometans, the beam orflump he ufed to lean on groaned, thereby expref-frng its grief for being thus deferted, and nolonger thought worthy to be employed in fo ho¬nourable a fervice.Mahomet ftill vigoroufly pufhed on the war a-gainft the Jewifh Arabs, and having taken the.city of Choibar, fixed his quarters in the houfeof one of the principle inhabitants, whofe daugh¬ter dreffing a fhoulder of mutton for his fupper,poifoned it, in order to make trial whether he was3 prophet or not, as fhc herfelf acknowledged;for if he was a prophet, fhe concluded, he couldcertainly know that the meat was poifoned, andfo would receive no harm: but if he was not aprophet, fhe thought it would be-doing the worlda good fervice to rid it of fo great a tyrant andimpoftor.MAHOMET. 29inipoflor Oa this occafijn fon\3 of the Mahome¬tans tell us of a miracle, viz. “ That the Ihoul-“ der of mutton fpoke, and informed Mahomet“ of its being potfoned;” but alas! it was rathertoo late, for one of his company eating greedilyof it, fell down dead upon the place; and thought-Mahomet had not immediately the fame fate, hav¬ing but juft tailed it, yet he fwallowed fo muchthat he was neve«r quite well afterwards, and dial-of it at three years end in the city of Medina,Mahomet having now an army of ten thoufandmen under his command, refolved to make him-felf niafter of Mecca j and accordingly on pretencethat the inhabitants had broken the truce, hemarched on a fudden, and furprifed the city,,which not being in any pollute of defence, fur-rendered'to him without oppofition. Having tak¬en pofleilion of it, he put to death all thofe thathad been his mo ft zealous enemies ; which ftruckfuch terror to the reft, that they readily fubmittedto his government and religion. He then pro¬ceeded to break down the images in and abouttheir temple, and gave it a new confecration, de¬termining to continue it in its ancient honour, bymaking it ftiii the chief place of his worihip, andenjoining his followers to refort thither in pilgri¬mage as formerly. The images of . moil-note hefound in their temple, were thofe of Abrahamand Ilhmael; but there was a multitude of oth&rs,both within and without, which the Arabiansworfhipped as mediators and intercefibrs for themwith the fupreme God.; for the Arabians alwaysheld-, that there was but one only God, the Crea¬tor and governor of all things, whom they neverdurft reprefent by any image, and whom tneythought themfelves unworthy to approach diredtywith*a30 The HISTORY ofwithout any mediation. This was the reafon oftheir placing of the images of angels and holy menin their temples, to which they dire&ed theirworiliip and devotions, and in this confided thewhole of the Arabian idolatry, which Mahomettotally abolifhed.The fuccefs oT Mahomet’s arms, and his inno¬vations in matters of religion united the Pagantribes of the Arabians againd bim; who afl'em-bling their forces gave him battle, and drove himto the very walls of Mecca; but he having ralliedhis troops, and renewed the engagement, he gain¬ed fuch a complete vi&ory over his enemies, thathe took from them their baggage, their wives andchildren, and all their fubdance; which confidedchiefly in flocks of fheep and herds of cattle. Theremaining part of the year was fpent in demolifii-: ing the temples and images of the Arabians where-rvcr he came : and having reduced mod part of A-rabia under his power, the following year he tur¬ned his arms towards Syria, and made himfelftnafter of Tobuc, a town belonging to the GreekEmperor; after which he forced feveral pettyprinces to become tributaries to him and then re¬turned with his vi&orious army to Medina.Mahomet’s empire and religion became now tobe edablidied throughout all Arabia ; and he fent"bis lieutenants to different parts of the country to'govern in his name, who made it their fird bu-finefs to deltroy the Pagan temples and images,and all the remains of the Arabian idolatry. To¬wards the conclufion of the year, Mahomet un¬dertook a pilgrimage to Mecca, where a vad con-courfe of people refortcd to him from all parts of IArabia, whom he inflruitcd in his new law, andjthen returned to Medina.SoorMAHOMET. 51Soon after this journey, he found himfelf in «very bad ftate of health, occafioned by the poifonhe had taken about three years before, which flillworking in his body, at lad brought him fo low,that he was forced to take to his bed, and diedin lefs than a fortnight. Being delirious in hisficknefs, he called for pen, ink, and paper, tellinghis people he would leave them fuch inftruflionsas thould preferve them from error after his death;but fome of his particular friends that were abouthim, being fenfible of his condition, put it off,and nothmg was done in the affair; which manyof the Mahometans fecm to bewail, as thinkingit a great unhappinefs to be deprived of thefe in¬tended di&ates of their dying prophet. During! his iilnefs he complained much of the bit that hei had eaten at Choiber, telling thofe that vifitedhim, that he had felt the torments of it in hisbody ever fince, and zfc times it brought upon him'] very dangerous pains; that now his heart-ftrings1 were about to break. At laft he expired in theI greateft mifery.His death occafioned fome confufion among hisI followers, for many of them apprehended he couldHot die, or at lealt that he would revive again ;; and therefore affembled about the door of the* houfe where the corps lay, crying out, “ Do notj “ bury him, for the Apoftle of God is not dead.”( One Omar, a principal man among them, was ofJ this opinion, and drawing his fword, fwore, “That1 “ if any one fhould fay Mahomet was dead, he“ would cut him to piecesbut Abu Beker, whofeems by his addrefs on feveral occafions, to bethe bell qualified to fuccecd the Impoilor, camein and demanded, “ Do you v/orfhip Mahomet,or the God of Mahomet ? If one worship the“ God32 The HISTORY of i° God of Mahomet, he is immortal and lives for“ ever; but as for Mahomet, he is certainly dead.” |And then cited feveral pailages from the Alcoran, !to prove that he mud die as other men. Where- i|upon Omar and his party were fatisfied, and be-lieved their prophet was dead, not to come to life j|again, till the general reforreclion.No foon«r was this difpute ended, but another [arofe about the place of nis burial; for thofe who ified with him from Mecca, infilled that he fliould 1be buried there ; and thole of Medina, being de- ijfirous of having him interred in their city, where |he had ended his days; and a third party plead- ied, that he ought to be carried to Jerufalem, andto be buried amongft the prophets: but in this par¬ticular alfo, they were governed by Abu Beker, •who told them, that he had often heard Mahomet 1himfelf fay, “ That a prophet fhould be buried in 1“ the place where he died ;” and thereupon corn*manded a grave to be dug diredlly under his bed, •where he was interred by the confent of all pre-fent, and not fufpended in the air in an iron coffin 'by means of loadltones, as has been fabuloufly re¬ported. A little chapel or tower, covered with>arcupula has fuice been built round his tomb, which i{lands at one of the corners of the chief mofque of|rMedina, founded by Mahomet himfelf, as beforeirelated; and hither the pilgrims frequently refort)out of deyction,_on their return from Mecca, tho’ jthey are under no obligation to do this from any lcommand of the Mahometan law.Mahomet was juft Hxtyvthree years old on the;day be died, and the three and twentieth year oujhis pretended apofllefhip : he had fpent thirteerjl ’at Mecca, and tne laft ten at Medina, in whieftj. tunelMAHOMET. 33time he laid the foandation of one of the greateftrevolutions that ever happened in the world-, forwithin the compafs of eighty years his fuccedbrsextended their dominion over more kingdoms thanthe Romans did in eight hundred; and tho’ theirempire did not continue in its grandeur much a-| hove three hundred years, yet out of it has arifeni feveral others, kingdoms and empires, fome of\i them the mofl: potent in the world, as thofe of? Turkey, Perfia, and the Great Mogul, &c.This pretended prophet, is faid to have been ofi a good ftature and comely afpe&, and affe&edi much to be thought to refemble the patriarch A-braham. And though it be granted that he was il-I literate, it is certain he had extraordinary natural| abilities, and well knew how to apply himfelf toI the paffions and afFettions of weak men, and makeevery accident fubfervicnt to his own defigns. His: two predominate paflions were lull ancl ambition.,, The courfe he took to eftablifh himfelf an empire,I abundantly fhews the latter, and the multitude ofi women he had to do with, fufficiently declaresI the former. And indeed a tin&ure of thefe runs: through the whole frame of his religion, there: being Icarce a chapter in the Alcoran which doesi not lay down fome law of war and bloodfhed, orelfe give fome liberty for the ufe of women here, or] fome promife for the enjoyment of them hereafter.j While his firft wife lived, it does not appear thati he took any other: but tho’ he was fifty years ofi age when fhe died, he afterwards multiplied wivesland concubines apace: thofe that fay he had thej feweft alloting him fifteen wives, and others rec-| koning up twenty-one, of which five died beforei fix he divorced, and ten were alive at his death,i One34 The HISTORY ofOne of his wives he took from one of his flavesjto whom fhe had been married before, which giv-ing great offence to his difciples, who looked u-pon it as a fcandalous action, he upon this com-pofed the 33d chapter of the Alcoran, where heintroduces God's approving his condu£l in thisaffair, and hence this wife took occafion to boatt,that his other wives were only given him by theirrelations, but flic was married to him by God htm-felf, who lives above the feven heavens.Befides his wives, Mahomet had an Egyptianconcubine in his old age, of whom he was ex¬tremely fond. This girl had been fent to him outof Egypt as a prefent, when (he was about fifteenyears of age, and he was foon captivated with herbeauty} but how privately feever he managed bisamours for fear of his wives, they were too cun¬ning for him, and catched him in bed with thisyoung Egyptian. Hereupon they reproached him'bitterly, that fo holy a man as he was, a prophetfent from God to teach men righteoufnefs, (houldprove falfe to their bed, and purfue his inordinateluffs in his advanced age; at which being quiteconfounded, he promifed with an oath, that ifthey would conceal the matter, he would never beguilty of the like crime for the future: but theviolence of his flame foon led him into the fametranfgreflion, and he was again difeovered in thefa£l by his jealous wives, who flew into a defpe-rate rage, and loaded him with heavier reproachesthan before : whereupon he was obliged to haverecourfe to his ufual artifice, pretending a newrevelation to juftify him in this particular, whichmay be found in the fixty-fixth chapter ol his Al¬coran, where he introduces God giving permillionto him and his followers to lie with their femaleMAHOMET. 3£I flares. This liberty, no doubtypave great fatisfae*: tioa to his difciples, and is to this day univerfallyI made ufe of in all the Mahometan countries.Mahomet was exceflirely jealous of his wives,! and accordingly, to deter them from a crime hai feared they would commit, he threatens them with5 double the punifhment of other wives, both hereand boreafter, if they proved falfe to his bed. Herequired them likewife, to remain in a (late of wi¬dowhood after his death, and prohibited his fol¬lowers to marry them.In fine, it is juftly obferved, that w'hatever Ma¬homet propoll|d to do, he always brought in hea¬ven approving it, and framed fome chapter of hisAlcoran to countenance his defign. If any objec¬tion againft him or his religion were to be anfwer-ed, any doubt to he folved, any difeontent amonghis people to be quieted, any Tcandal to be re¬moved, or whatever elfe was to be done for the in-tereft and promotion pf his impofture, his con-ftant recourfe was to the angel Gabriel for a newirevelation.Having now done with the hiftory of this fa-Eious Impoftor, fhall now give a fhort fketch ofae Mahometan religion, which may be fummedp in a very narrow compafs, for in general theymake but two articles of faith, and five of prac¬tice. The firft article of their creed is “Thatf‘ there is no other God but God j” which grand{maxim of their theology feems to have been taken| rom the Jews, who were often rehearfing thefchvords, “ Hear, O Ifrael, the Tord our God is oneLord,’ Heut. vi. 14. They not only infift on theinity of divine nature, in oppefition to tbofe thatworfhip%6 The HISTORY of■worfhip a plurality of gods, but there is only onc||jierfcn in the divine Trinity; and account all fuchjjas cwh any thing of number in the Divinity, to|be infidels and idolaters.The fecond article of the Mahometan faith is|ithis, “ That Mahomet was the meflenger of God.,!,|Hereby they intend to exclude all other religions Junder pretence that their prophet was the laft and 'greateft of all the prophets that God ever fent in- |to the world ; and, would have it believed, that |,ias the Jewifh religion ceafed on the coming of the |Meffiah, fo likewise the Chriftian religion was a-j,brogated by the coming of Mahomet: Not but!they acknowledge Mofes and Jefus Chrifi; to have ;,been great prophets; but Mahomet, they hold to ,be “ the prophet,” by way of excellence, and theComforter promifed lathe feripture, John xvi. y.Nay, they aff<?ft, that the very name of Mahomet. >both here and in other places of the gofpel, wasexprefsly mentioned ; but that the Chriftians, cutof prejudice, have erafed it, and corrupted the .facred writings.As the pradical part of the Mahometan reli- ,gion is chiefly comprehended in the five following i.precepts : i. That they obferve their corporeal pu |rifications. 2. That they pray to God at the ap|pointed times. 3. That they give alms to the poor ,4. That they fall during the month of Ramazen5. That they go in pilgrimage to the temple oMecca, if they are able. To thefe may be addesfeme other articles, •which are not efteemed abfolutely nectfTary to falvation: As that of circumcifion : Of keeping friday a fabbath: Of drinking no wine : And of eating no fwines flefh, no I;things flrangled. |MAHOMET. 39of the fervice feem in the leaft to abate their zealand devotion.The next indifpenfible duty of the Mahometans,and without which even their prayers are held tobe vain and incffe&ual, is that of alms giving}but their doctors are not agreed by what rules e-very one ought to meafure their charity. Somethink a man is obliged to give annually a tenthpart of his fubftance to the poor ; others fay thata fortieth, and fome that a hundredth is futficient.The truth is, they are commanded to give differ¬ent proportions of different forts of goods, and arealfo advifed to regard no limits in their liberalityi to the neceffuous. Hence it comes to pafs, that| many give a fourth of what they are worth, o-thers a third, and fome give half of their eftatcsonce in their lifetime; nay, there have been in-ftances of men who have given all their fortunesto the poor, and lived ever after upon alms them-1 felves. There is no people in the world among1 whom poverty is fo honourable as among the Ma-' hometans, who fay of a perfon that makes a vo¬luntary profeffion of it, “ That as he pofTeffes no-'j “ thing, fo he is poffefled by nothing by whichu they mean to fuggeft, that in the midft of his po-f1 verty, he is mafter of himfelf and of the world, onaccount of that freedom from carnal defires whichi they fuppofe he enjoys, whilft the reft of mankindare flaves to their paffions and infatiable appetites.The Mahometans look upon circumcifion ratheras a mark of obedience to their religion, than aneffemial law, and that it is not abfolutely neceffaryto falvation, though the omiffion is generally e-ftecmed finful, and believe that children may beTaved without it.TheThs HIS TOR T of Skc*1 The Mahometans regard Friday above bthedays of the ek, and regularly attend their piaces of public worlhip at noon, and fome of theirwill do no bufiriefs all chat dav, beqaufe thiy‘bSiieve it was on Friday th Mahomet, bein^’^rff jcured by the idolatrous inhabit ants of Mecca/ \WfIipreed to fly for fafety from chat city to rvfodiiu.Tho’ the Mahometans be prohibited the ufe o.'Anne, yet many cf them do not look upon it as ab'iolutely foebidden; and even thofe who doj can |limot help confdling it is an excellent litjuior, and ithrt the tempiaupn is io inriting, that the Irn olii i nkmg it is very excufabJe.

Wheithey are upon a journey, and judge it to be abouthe hour of prayer, they flop and make the preparatory oblation if water can be had ; and-thenfpreading a little carpet upon the ground, whichthey always carry along with them for that pur-pofe, they repeat the fame prayers and make thefame bowings and proflrations, as if they had beerprefent in their temples: and this they alfo perform in the ftreets, and places of the greateft con-courfe; which muft be allowed to carry with it arair of hypocrify, notwithftanding all their feem*ing fervency and attention.But upon the whole, it muft be acknowledgerthat the greateft reverence and attention of theMahometans in their addreffes to heaven, is whaimany Chriftians might blufh to obferve.

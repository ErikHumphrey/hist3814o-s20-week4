3jtheHIMOIRS OF GLASGOW FAIR.THE COMICAL SONGOPA U Xa D JOHH PAUL.SONGS.THE HUMOURS OF GLASGOW FAIR0, the sun frae the eastward was peeping,And braid through the winnocks did stare,When Willie cried, Tam, are you sleeping,Mak haste, man, and rise to the fair ;For the lads and the lasses are thranging,And a’ body’s now in a steer ;Fve, haste ye, and let us be ganging,Or, faith, we’ll be langsome, I fear.Lilt to turan an uran, &c.Then Tam he got up in a hurry,And wow but he made himself snod,For a pint o’ milk brose he did worry.To mak him mair tough for the road.On his head his blue bonnet he slippet.His whip o’er his shouther he flang.And a clumsy oak cudgel he grippet,On purpose the loons for to bang.Lilt te turan an uran, &c.Now Willock had trysted wi’ Jenny,For she was a braw canty queen.Word gade she had a gay penny,For whilk Willie fondly did grean.•>oiSTow Tam he was blaming the liquor,Yae night he had got himseT fou,And trysted gleed Maggy Mac Vicar,And, faith, he thought shame for to rue.Lilt te turan an uran, &c.The carles fu’ codgie sat cockin’Upon their white nags and their brown,Wi’ snuffing, and laughing, and joking,They soon canter’d into the town ;’Twas there was the funning and sporting,Eh! what a swarm o’ braw folk,Rowly powly, wild beasts, wheel o’ fortune,Sweety stan’s. Master Punch, and Black Jock.Lilt te turan an uran, &c.Vow Willock and Tam, gayan bouzy.By this time had met wi’ their joes,Consented wi’ Gibbie and SusyTo gang awa down to the shows,’Twas there was the fiddling and drumming.Sic a crowd they could scarcely get through,Fiddles, trumpets, and organs a-bumming,0 sirs, what a hully baloo.Lilt te turan an uran, &c.Then hie to the tents at the paling,Weel theekit wi’ blankets and mats.And deals seated round like a tap-room.Supported on stanes and on pats.&4Ilie whisky like water they’re selling,And porter as sma’ as their yill,And ay as you’re pouring, they’re telling,Troth, dear, it’s just sixpence the gill.Lilt te turan an uran, &c.Says Meg, see yon beast wi’ the taes ou’t,'Wi tlie face o’t as black as the soot,Preserve’s, it has fingers and taes on’t, Eh, lass, it’s an unco like brute.O woman, but ye are a gomeral.To male sic a won’er at that,D’ye no ken, daft gouk, that’s a mangrel.That’s bred ’twixt a dog and a cat.Lilt te turan an uran, &c.See yon supple jade how she’s dancing,^ Wi’ the white ruffl’d breeks and red shoon,Frae tap to the tae she’s a’ glancingWi’ gowd, and a feather aboon.My troth, she’s a braw decent kimmerAs I’ve yet seen in the fair;Her decent, quo’ Meg, she’s some limmer,Or faith she would never be there.Lilt te turan an uran, &c.Before they got out o the bustle,Poor .Tam got his fairing, I trow,For a stick at the ging’bread play’d whistle.And knock’d him down like a cow ;oSays Tam, wlia did that, de'il confound him,Fair play, let me win at the loon,And he whirl'd his stick round and round him,And swore like a very dragoon.Lilt te turan an uran, Ac.Then next for a house they gade glow’ring,Whare they might get wetting their mou’,Says Meg—here’s a house keeps a pouring.At the sign o’ the muckle black cow.A cow, quo’ Jenny, ye gawky.Preserve us, but ye’ve little skill.Ye haveral, did ye e’er see hawkyLike that, look again and ye’ll see it’s a bull.Lilt te turan an uran, &c.But just as they darken’d the entry,Says Willie, we’re now far eneugh,I see it’s a house for the gentry,Let’s gang to the sign o’ the Fleugh.Na, faith, says Gibbie, we’se betterGae dauner to auld Luckio Gunn’s,For there I’m to meet wi’ my father,And auld uncle Jock o’ the whins.Lilt te turan an uran, Ac.Now they a’ in Luckie’s had landed,Twa rounds at the bicker to try,The whisky and yill round was handed,And baps in great bourooks did lie ;GBlind Aleck the fiddler was tr.ysted,And he was to handle the bow,On a big barrel head he was hoisted,To keep himsel’ out o’ the row.Lilt te turan an uran, Ac.Had ye seen sic a din and gafaaing.Sic hooching and dancing was there,Sic rugging, and riving, and drawing,Was ne’er seen before in a fair.Lor Tam, he wi’ Maggy was wheeling.And he gied sic a terrible loup,That his head cam a thump on the ceiling,And he cam down wi’ a dump on his doup.Lilt te turan an uran, &c.Now they ate and they drank till their belliesWere bent like the head of a drum,Syne they raise and they caper’d like fillies,Whene’er that the fiddle play'd bum.Wi’ dancing they now were grown weary,And scarcely were able to stan’.So they took to the road a’ fu’ cheery,As day was beginning to dawn.Lilt te turan an uran, &c.ATJLD JOHN PAUL.Auld John Paul was nae lazy man,An’ auld John Paul was nae crazy man ;Tho’ his haffits were white, and his noddle was ba>Yet a slee,

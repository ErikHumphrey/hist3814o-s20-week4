No such things can very well be,Said the one brother unto the other,For twenty men arid you arid myself,Wmikl be little enough to set him free.They went to the smith and got their horse slmd,And oh but he shod them irapkliy.I And when he was done with shoeing our horses,We made him ride in our company.We mounted our horses* and off we did ridefAnd oh ! but we rode right manfully,Until we came to that bonny wee town.The name of it bonny Dundee.Six did hold the bridle reins,And seven did gaurd the city about, fAnd seven more and Dickie himself.Went in to let his brother out.They broke through locks and they broke through doors!They broke through every thing came in their way, i{Until they came to a large iron gate,And that’s where brother Archie lay.Said brother Dickie unto brother Archie,Will you speak three words to me,Twenty men and I myselfHave ventured our lives to set you free.Said brother Archie unto brother Dickie,Nay such things they cannot very well be,I or theirs twenty stone of good Spanish iron,Betwixt my neck hone and my kneeHiey broke through locks and they broke through door 'They broke through every thing in their wayTill Dickie got Arcltie into his arms,A nd carried his brother safe awayThey mounted their horses and off they did ride.And oh! but they rode right manfully.Said brother Archie unto brother Dickie,You don’t see what I do see,For yonder’s the provost of Dundee,And a hundred men in his company;My horse be is young and be cannot well swim.And this is the place where I am to die, l !; !Said brother Archie unto brother Dickie,Nay, such things it cannot well be,You'll take my horse, and I'll take yours,We ’ll swim the river right manfully.They mounted their horses, and off they did swim,And' O but they swim .tight bonnily, , fr. ■['Until the!

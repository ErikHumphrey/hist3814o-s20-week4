FRASER & C©»rLISTERS, ST^LIKG.THE EXCISEMAN.To a village that skirted the sea,An Exciseman one midsummer eame;Tut prudence between you and me,Forbids me to mention his name.Soon Michael he chanc’d to espy,A cask on his napper he bore,With six gallons of brandy, Or nigh;And whei'e is the head can bear more?Says the Exciseman, Let’s see your permit.Says Mike, T’ant convenient to shew it.T’other cried. Sir, I’m not to be bit,You’ve smuggl’d that stuff, and you know itYour hogs to a fine market you’ve brought;For seeing you’ve paid no excise,As customs have settl'd you ought,I seizes your tub as my prize.Now don’t be so hard, said poor Mike:Th’ Exciseman was deaf to conaplain.Why then, take it, said Mike, if you like,For I’ve borne it till ready to faint.Four miles in hot sunshine they trudg’d,Till on them they’d scarce a dry rag;Th' Exciseman his labour ne'er grudg’d,Tut cheerfully carried cog.To the custom-house in the next town,’Twas yet some three furlongs or more,iWhen says Michael, Pray set your load down,i For this here, sir, is my cottage door.'T’other answer’d, I thank you friend, no;My burden, just yet, I shan’t quit.Then, says Michael, before you do ”o,I’ll get you’toread my permit.•9Your permit! Why not show it before.'*Because it came into my nob,By your watching so long on the shore,Ihat your worship was wanting a job;Now, I’d need of a porter, d’ye see,For the load made my bones almost crack;i iAnd so, sir, I thank you for me,And wish you a pleasant walk back.GO where glory waits thee.Go where glory waits thee,But while fame elates thee,Oh! still remember me:When the praise thou meetest,To thine ear is sweetest,Oh! then remember me:Other arms may press rhee,Dearer friends caress thee,AH the joys that bless thee,But when friends are nearest,And when joys are dearestOh! then remember me.When at eve thou rovest,By the star thou Jovest,Oh! then remember me:Think wnen home returning,Bright we've seen it burning,Oh! then remember me:Oft as summer closes,When thine eye reposesOn its ling’ring roses.Once so lov’d by theeThink on her who wove them,Her who made thee love them,Oh! then remember me.When around thee dying,Autumn leaves are lying,Oh! then remember me;And at night, when gazingOn the gay hearth blazing,Oh! then remember me;Then should music stealingAll the soul of feeling,To thy heart appealing,Draw one tear from thee;Then let mem’ry bring thee,Strains I us’d to sing thee,Ohj then remember me.— KATE O’ COWRIE..!'When Katie was scarce out nineteen,t O but she had twa coal-black e»n:, A bonnier lass ye wadna seen.In a’ the Carse o’ Cowrie.I Quite tir’d o’ livin’ a' his lane,1 Pate to her did his love explain,^ An’ swore he’d bs, were she his ain,The hapoiest lad in Cowrie., Quo’ she, I winna marry thee,i For a’ the gear that ye can gie;'Nor will I gang ae step a-jee,• For a’ the gowd o’ Cowrie.iiiMy father will gie me twa L-yo*iliMy mither's gaun some yarn to dye;Ill’ll get a gown just like the sky,Gif I’ll no gang to Cowrie.sO my dear Katie, say na sae,We little ken a heart that’s wae;.Mae, there’s my hand, hear me, I pray,Sin’ thou’ll uo gang to Cowrie.iBince first I met thee at theshiel,My saul to thee’s been true and leal;fhe darkest night I fear nae deil,Warlock, or witch, in Cowrie.11 ;Vi fear nan want o’ claise, nor nought-;6Sic silly thiags tnv min'd ne’er taught;I dream a’ night, an’ start about,An’ wish for thee .in Gowrie.I lo'e th 'e better, Kate, my dear,Than a* my rigs, and out-gaun g«ar;Sir iov n -y me, till ance I swear,Thou’rt worth the Carse o’ Gowrie.Sine on hsr mouth sweet kisses laid,Till blushes a’ her cfie.ks o’erspread;Shu sigh’d, and m salt whispers said,O Pate, tak me to Gowrie.Quo’ he. let’s to the auld fouk gang,Say what they like, I’il bide their bang,And bide a night, tho’ .beds be thrang,But I'll hae thee to Gowrie.The auld fonk syne baith gied consent,The priest was ca’d, a’ were content;Add Katie never did repent,That she gaed hame to Gowrie.For routh o’ bonnie bairns had she,Mair strappin’ lads ye wadna see;And her braw lasses bare the gree,Frae the rest o’ Gowrie.THE ORPHAN BOY.No cheering sun-beam’s friendly ray,on the dark and cloudy day,1When I, an outcast from my birth,Sprung up the humblest flower on earth.No parent stalk to prop its form,No shelter from the winter’s storm—: Such was the fate, bereft of joy,Of Theodore, the orphan boy.’Twas your dear hand, by pity led.First rais’d the lily’s drooping head,Foster’d the bud bedew’d with tears,Then saw it blossom into years:And whilst your smiles such ppw’r can give.Still will it flourish, bloom, and live;Ah* do not then the hopes destroyI Of Theodore, the orphan boy.THE MAID OF LODI.I sing the maid of Lodi,Who sweetly sung to me,Whose brows were never cloudy,Nor e’er distort with glee.She values not the wealthy,Unless they’re great and good.For she is strong and healthy.And by labour earns her food.And when her day’s work’s over;Around a cheerful fire,\*/8She sings, or rests contented;What more can man desire?Let those who squander milliensReview her happy lot,They’ll find their proud pavillionsFar inferior to her cot.Between the Po and ParmaSome villains seiz’d my coach,And dragg’d me to a cavern,Most dreadful to approach;By which the maid of LodiCame trotting from the fait:She paus'd to hear my wailings,And see me tear mv hair.Then to her market basket.“ihe tied her poney s rein;I thus by female courage'Was dragg’d to life again.Then sing the maid of Lodi,Who sweetly sung to me;And when this maid is marriedjStill happier may she be.v i to i s.

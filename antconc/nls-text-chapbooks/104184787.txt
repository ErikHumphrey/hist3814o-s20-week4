'the ignorance of the inhabitants of the northwas favourable to the introduction of Popery in its.' igrossest form among them ; and, accordingly, thatestablished in Scotland was illiberal and bigotted irthe extreme. Doctrines and legends the most optto shock the understaliding were proposed withoutany disguise, and their truth' or rdasOnablenes?Were never caijbd ih question by tire people.3The profusion of the Scots kept pace with theirsuperstition ; for at the Reformation one half ofthe lands of Scotland were the property of thechurch. David I. had made over almost the wholeof those belonging to the crown, and his examplewas imitated, not only by many of-his successors,but by all orders of men, with whom the foundinga monastery, or endowing a church, was thoughtto be a safhcient atonement for the breach of everycommand in the decalogue.Besides the influence derived from the natureand extent of their property, generally let on lease,on easy terms, to the younger sons and dependentsof‘great families, the; weight the clergy had inParliament was very considerable. The numberof temporal barons being extremely limited, andthe lesser barons and representatives of boroughslooking upon it as a hardship to attend, combinedwith the mode of choosing the Lords of the ArticlesIts proceedings in a great measure were left undertheir direction and control.The Lords of the Articles were a Committeewhose business it was to prepare and digest allmatters that were to be laid before Parliament.Every motion for a new law was made in this com¬mittee, and approved or rejected by the membersof it; what they approved was formed into a bill,and presented to Parliament i what they rejectedcould not he introduced into tht^house. ^Phis com¬mittee owed the extraordinary powers vested in itto the military genius of the arreient nobles, and inthis way not only directed all the ptdccedfn^s ofParliament^ but possessed a negative, before de¬bate. It consisted of eight temporal and .eightspiritual lords, of eight representatives of boroughs,and of the eight great •officers of the: Cfowli.' andwhen its co!>A|>osit«on is'considered, it wfll eVilyr*be Mien biJir . r^iuencc.if t, • iW.^Ireadv too great puvy«j>i>f j?ie:(;W*£gy.; ... • , r tTheir character t«I«o war heiii severe;!were they subject, to the same iatvi, ntr trted-bythe jame judges as . the laity, a rcuvarkahic in¬stance of yvhivii occurred .on the trial of the mur¬derers of Cardinal Beaton, one; of wbqfrj *»1af apriest. He was claimed by a delegate from tji£clerical Courts, and, exempted fro^n the judgmeatof Parliament on that accountBy their reputation fyr learnings they almostwholly engrossed the high odices of einolumentand trust in th.e civil govcrnifnt 5 but even thiswas not for acting in their capacity of confessors,they made use of all thoye omlivrs which operatemost powerfully on the luunun mind, to prouipfe,the interest of the church, pa tiiai few were snf-fefetf to leave Bie world witiiout bestow ing on hersome marks of their liberality, ami where cr^dtd'ity failed to produce this effect, they flailed in theaid of law. f When a person died intestate, by. thftrj'id Statute pf William the Lion, the diiposal ofIds eiFects was vested in the bishop of the diocese,after paying hU funeral charge.’} and debts, and dfcs-tfibutittg among his kindred the swu4 to v,b;chthey were respectively entitlLd, it, being presumed,that no Christian unu’^d have chosen to leave theworld u;ithout destining some part of his sul^taUcetp pious purposes.)

The bare¬faced impositions that were practised by the monkson the credulous, are almost inconceivable.—Amongqther customs of those times, it was common lorthem to travel to Rome and come home laden withrelics,.blessed by his holiness, dispensations for sin,by which they wheedled the credulous out of theirmoney. One of these, on a holiday, endeavouringto vend his wares to the country people, amongother things shewed them a bell with a rent in it,possessing the virtue of discovering the truth orfallacy of an oath ; for. as lie pretended, if any oneswore truly, with his hand ou the bell, he couldeasily remove it, without any change.; but if theoath was false, h)5 hand would stick to it, and theIbfiil ieflt,aaijp.dei.

After the death of, James V>her husband, the Earl of Arran, was appointed lie¬ge ut of the. kingdom during the minority of herdaughter ; and from that situation she w ished to ex.elude him, that she might enjoy the first honoursof. the state alone, and promote the designs of herbroUiers upon Scotland. For this purpose she ap-plied to the favourers of the Reformation, as beingthe most uumerou.jof the Regentyene.mies, and fortn'ing a respectable body iu the stale ; and althoughher promises of protection were insincere, they,, ina very considerable .degree, abated the fury of per¬secution. ; .John Knox, wi:o contributed so much, both by.precept and example, to work out the Relorntab 'Ufrf.yn Popery; was tFe- dcsctfidaut of srn aircientfamiFy, andBorn at.

In this letter,contending for the truth of what he taught, hesays, “Albeit, Madam, that the messengers ofGod are not sent this day with visible miracles,because they teach no other doctrine than thatwhich is confirmed with miracles from the begin¬ning of the world, yet will not he (who hath pro¬mised to take charge over his poor and little flockto the end) suffer the contempt of their anvbas-sage to escape punishment and; vengeance, for thetruth itself hath said, ‘ he that heareth you hearetljone, and he that contemneth you contemned! one.'I do not speak unto you.

Mr Ersk'mehaving joined his associates at Perth, his represeo-tatioii of the Queen's irreconcilable hatred so in¬flamed the peopje, that scarcely the authority ofthe magisttates, or die exhortations of their preach¬ers, coidd prevent them from proceeding to acts ofviolence.At, this Juncture, Mr lynox landed in Scothtridfrom France, and, after residing two days in Edin-burglr, joined his brethren in Perth, that*he inigl.taid them in their eause, and give his confessioi'i;along with theirs. Qu the 11th, the day alter thesentence of outlawry was promninVcd, he made a.vehement discourse against idolatry, and while theminds of the people were yet in a state of agitation,,from the impression made upon them by his ser¬mon, a priest prepared to‘Vlllehrate mass/ whichmade a youth observe. ‘*T!Fris is intolerable, thatwhen God in his word' hath plainly condemnedidolatry we shall‘stand'and sefe it used in despite.'The irritated prfest struck him a blow on the ear,jand the youth in revenge threw a stone at himJjwhich broke aft raoagn of one of the saints.

These termswere preserved till she received the expected rein¬forcements, when she fortified Leith, from whichall the efforts of the reformers were unable todislodge her troops. A mutiny also breaking outahioug their soldiers for want of pay, and havingbeen dd'eaied in two skirmishes with, the Frenchtroops, it was resolved, by a majority of the lordsof the congregation, to retire to Stirling. Thisrash step was productive of great terror and con¬fusion, and contrary to the advice of Knox ; who*notwithstanding, followed the fortunes of hisfriends, animating and reviving them by his dis¬courses, and exhorting them to constancy in thegood cause.At a meeting held shortly after their arrival at(Stirling, it was resolved, to dispatch William Mait-»slJand, who had lately deserted the Queen’s party,ito England, to implore the assistance, of QoeetiElizabeth ; and a treaty was at last concluded, bvwhich a body of troops was'sent to their assistance.'These being joined by most of the Scottish nob!.thly, a peace was established on the 8th duly, 1560,jjby which the reformed religion was fully establish-ned in Scotland.1 On the abolition of Popery, the form of church'government established in So'.'laud was, upon thelujodel of the church at Geneva, warmly recom-imended to his countrymen by Knox, as beingjfartbcsl removed from all similarity to the Romish^church ; and at his .suggestion, likewise, the conn,jlry was divided into twelve districts, for the more2(1«#>*tua!ly prbpagatuTg, the/dcciVinas of Slieii'Rpfw.nuitxjfi, of Cilicia Edinburgh was asM^n^d to J»n«ave.

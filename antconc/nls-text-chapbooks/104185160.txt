’’—0 Swearer, fear the NameThat makes the demons quake;When faith beholds the bleed-ng Lamb,Thy foot will find the brake!THE LAMENT OP MORIAN SHEHONE FOEMARY BOURKE.(TBAXSLAXBD FBOU THE IBI9H.)Tcnh—“ The Meeting of the Waters."How painful the silence that round me prevails,Since the voice of my Mary awakes not the dales;Ah! yes, thou art mute, but thy Morian ShehoneWill raise thy lament, and thine absence bemoan.Thy virtue, like snow, was so dazzling and fair,That youth gazed with rapture on beauty so rare,And age, like the ivy, for aid round thee clung,Entranced by the music that flowed from thy tongue7Tho’ bright was thy beauty, thy sun must descend,And darkness envelope the soul ot“ thy friend;Yet sorrow is dumb, save the wail of my woe,Po'- the tears that would soothe me refuse yet to flowI have wept o'er the rich, but the stone on his graveAbated my grief like the ebb of the wave;But, oli! my heart’s darling, no mountain of stoneCan hide thy fair form from thy Morian Shehone.Oh, where is the beauty that tilled thine abode,When bright with thy presence its four corners glowed ?Thou fell’st not like leaflet in trembling decay,For rude was the tempest that tore thee away.Oh, hadst thou not friends that would give thee theirheart FAV ith raiment and bread to enjoy and impart ?tV hile spring warmed thy bosom, and love crownedthy bead,Oh, why not live happy F—Oh, why hast thou fled?But the spoiler has come and my peace overthrown;The tyrant has broken the stay of Shehone :In the time of probation none envied thy lot,F or thy kindness the wants of the poor ne er forgot.Since vows moved not Death peerless Mary to save,Shehone’s burning tears may not enter thy grave;Then twice ev’ry year shall the maids of the valeThe birth and the death of my Mary bewail.Beneath the wide elm may her spirit he near.And teach them to rival her lovely career;—Now fades into silence, profound, sad and lone.The feeble lament of the cheerless Shehone.8THE BHil> ON THE WIRE.Tune—“ Bonnie Ihmdee."A Bird from the Glens, where the fallow deer bay,Tiira-la, tirra-lee; tirra-la, tirra-lee;Flew down to the Lowlands to polish his lay,Tirra-la, tirra-lee; tirra-la, tirra-lee.Fly hiirh or fly low, ne’er a tree met his bHl,Tirra-la, tirra-lee; tirra-la, tirra-lee ;Save wide fields of Barley that waved for the still,Tirra-la, tirra-lee ; tirra-la, tirra-lee.But, meeting a wire with its cups and its bars,Tirra-ia, tirra-lee; tirra-la, tirra-lee ;Unconscious, he'perched near the roll of the cars,Tirra-la, tirra-lee; tirra-la, tirra-lee.While mist from the wave found him pruning his wines,Tirra-la, tirra-lee; tirra-la, tirra-lee;A shock, telegraphic, rushed thro’ his heart-strings,Tirra-la, tirra-lee; tirra-la, tirra-lee;Incapable! must he be crushed by the trainsVTirra-la, tirra-lee ; tirra-la, tirra-lee;Nay ; quickly the use of his pinions he gains,Tirra-la, tirra-lee; tirra-la, tirra-lee.Then, spreading his wings for the woods of his sires,Tirra-la, tirra-lee; tirra-la, tirra-lee;He rushed from the land of the bird-shocking wires,Tirra-la, tirra-lee; tirra-la, tirra-lee!Note. Birds are not killed by the electric current as theyperch on the telegraphic wires; but there are bar*, crips, andcurrents, near most of our ’ailway Stations, that prove verydetrimental to many imprudent passenger pigeons.FINIS.

James Was brought in—the wife was bawk’dThe priest stood ' lose—the miller crack’d—Then ask’d his sunken gloomy spouse,What supper had she in tiie house.That might be suitable to gieAnfc of their lodger's quality ?Quoth she, “ You may well ken, gudeman,“ Your feast comes frae the potiage pan :“ The stov’d or roasted we afford.Are aft great strangers on our board.”“ Pottage, (quoth Hah) yesenseless law pie!“ Think ye this youth’s a gillygawpy ;“ And that his gentle stamock’s master“ To worry up a pint o’ plaister,“ Like our mill knaves that lift the lading,“ Wliase kytes can streek out like raw plaidin J“ Swithe roast a hen; or fry some chickens,“ And send for Ale fine Maggy Picken’s.”“ Ilout I, (quoth she) ye may wed ken,“ ’Tis ill brought butt that’s no there ben;“ When but last owk, nae farder gane,“ The laird got a’ to pay his kain.”Then James, wha had as good a guessOf what was in the house as Bess,With pawkie smile, this plea to end.To please himsel, and ease his friend.First open’d wi’ a slee orationHis wond’rous skill in conjuration :Said he, “ By this fell art I’m able“ To whop aft' ony great man's table“ Whate’er I like to make a meal of,“ Either in part, or yet the bale of;u And, if you please, I’ll shaw my airt—”Cries Halbert, “ Faith, wi’ a’ my heart!”Bess fain’d lierael,—cried, “ Lord be here-!”And near hand fell a swoon for fear.James leugh, and bade her naething dread,Syne to his conj’ring went wi’ speed:•>And first he draws a circle roiSid,Then utters mony a magic soundOf words, part Latin, Greek, and Dutch ;Enow to fright a very witch.That done, he says, “ Now, now, ’tis come,“ And in the boal beside the lum:“ Now set the board; gudewife, gae ben,“ Bring frae yon boal a roasted hen.”She wadna gang, but Haby ventur’d ;And soon as he the ambry enter’d,It smell’d sae weel, he short time sought it,And, wond’ring, ’tween his hands he brought it.He view’d it round, and thrice he smelt it;Syne with a gentle touch he felt it.Thus ilka sense he did convene.Lest glamour had beguil’d his een:They all, in an united body,Declar’d it a tine fat how-towdy.“<Nae mair about it, (quoth the miller)“ The fowl looks well, and we’ll fa’ till her.”Sae be’t, says James; and in a doupThey snapt her up baith stoop and roup.“ Neist, O! (cries Halbert) coud your skill“ But help us to a waught o’ ale,“ I’d be oblig’d t’ ye a’ my life,“ And offer to the deil my wife,“ To see if he’ll discreeter mak her,“ But that I’m fleed he winna tak her ”10Said James, “Ye offer very fair;“ The bargain's hadden, sae nae mair.”Then thrice he shook a willow wand;'With kittle words thrice gave command ;That done, wi* look baith learn’d and grave,Said, “ Now ye'll get what ye wad have;“ Twa bottles of as nappy liquor“ As ever ream’d in horn or bicker,“ Behint the. ark that bauds your meal,“ Ye’ll find two standing corkit w eel.”He said, and fast the miller flew.And frae their nest the bottles drew ;Then first the scholar’s health he toasted,IVhase art had gart him feed on roasted;His father’s neist, and a’ the restOf his good friends that wish’d him best*Which were o’er langsome at the time,In a short tale to put in rhime.Thus while tire miller and the youthWere blythely slockeping of their dronth,Bess, fretting, scarcely held frae greeting ;The priest, inclos’d, stood vex’d and sweating.“ O wow ! said Hah, if ane might speer,“ Dear Master James, w ha brought oar cheer?“ Sic laits to us appear sae awfu’,“ We hardly think your learning lawfu’.”XI“ To bring your doubts to a conclusion,“ Says James, ken I’m a Rosicrusian,“ Ane of1 the set that never carries« On traffic with black deils or fairies ;“ There’s mony a sp'rit that’s no a deil,“ That constantly around us wheel.“ There was a sage, call’d Albumazor,“ Whase wit was gleg as ony razor ;“ Frae this great man we learn’d the skill“ To bring these gentry to our will ;“ And they appear, when we’ve a mind,“ In ony shape of human kind :“ Now, if you’ll drap your foolish fear,“ I’ll gar my Pacolet appear.”Hab fidg’d and leugh, his elbuck clew,Baith fear’d and fond a sp’rit to view :At last his courage wan the day,He to the scholar’s will gae way.Bessy be this began to smellA rat, but kept her mind to ’rsel:She pray’d like howdy in Her drink,But mean time tipt young James a. wink.James frae his eye an answer sent,Which made the wife right well content:Then turn’d to Hab, and thus advis’d,“ Whatever you see, be nought surpris’d;‘ But for your saul move not your tongue;And ready stand wi’ a great rung;12“ Syne as the gp’rit gangs marching out',“ Be sure to lend him a sound rout:“ I bidna this by way of mocking,“ For nought delights him mair than knocking.”Hab got a kent—stood by the hallan.And straight the wild mischievous callanCries, “ Radamanthus Husky Mingo,“ Monk, Horner, Hipock, Jinko, Jingo,“ Appear in likeness of a priest,“ No like a deil, in shape o’ beast,“ With gaping chaffs to fleg us a’:  “ Wauk forth, the door stands to the wa.”Then frac the hole where he was pent.The priest approach’d right weel content;Wi’ silent pace strade o’er the floor,’Till he was drawing near the door ;Then to escape the cudgel ran,But was na miss’d by the gudeman,Wha lent him on the neck a lounder,That gart him owre the threshold founder.Darkness soon hid him frae their sight:Ben flew the miller in a fright;“ I trow (quoth he) I laid well on;“ But wow he’s like our ain Mess John.”

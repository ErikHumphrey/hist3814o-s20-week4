I’m a queer little comical soul.And if you’ll believe me, though I think you may see,I’m the lad with the carroty poll.Oh dear ! oh dear ! I fear I shall never get wed ;For indeed you must know, wherever I go.They laugh at my carroty head.T’other day I went up to town with young squire.They said that my head would set Lunnon a fire :I see’d pratty women, wi’ cheeks like a rose ;I gave one a kiss, but she painted my nose ;Oh dear ! oh dear ! I couldn’t I’m sure, for mysoul.Like the touch of her cheek, if I rubbed for a week.Get the red from my carroty poll.Oh dear ! oh dear ! a quack in our village one day.He said that he could, and I sa’d that he should.Come and take all my carrots away.So he rubb’d and he scrubb’d till my face went awry,Wi’ some stuff that he called his new patent dye.My hair he turn’d black, and my pockets he drain’d.And I looked like the devil the first day it rain’d.Oh dear ! oh dear ! I war such a transmogrified soul,For my head were as bald, as a pig that is scall’d.And I longed for my carroty poll.i*Oh deaf ! oh dear.! the joy of im.heai;t yoa umst*■) i ilw /l. a i > ~ - vx . v l 1know.Was to see the first gprout of lay hifir^heolfing ont.When the carrots began to grow^, 019(r aD ,, irj.jAnd my happiness now has arrived at the top,Because I. have got such a glomus c*op ;And the lesson I’ve learnt is never to fret.But be always content with whatever I get 5Oh dear ! oh dea-r !• the queer little comical fo»ljEver will laud tlie,hands the* applaud’ 1v x;The lad with the carroty poll^, . 1 r \^ l cot , :-rash do ! ai <10W LAY OF THE'MILL :koh IKE ok thri bAt-kiWr.it e aounnJ Isa t ■ 1 tad ym Isdj bic? ^adTHr.V, the rnerryiptiy-nigbt.Ho-, the merry pay-niglit; ; ‘T-.^Tis fun to see now we agree, f!

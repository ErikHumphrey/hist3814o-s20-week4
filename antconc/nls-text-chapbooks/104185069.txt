Site was in a chariotdrawn by four white horses, in silver trappings,and shadowing plumes of feathers of various co¬lours, attended by a train of servants dressed in therichest garments that couTd be got, and with her,as her companions, were divers beautiful virgins, sothat she appeared like Diana surrounded with hernymphs, yet outshining them as far as the sun doesthe flittering stars. This object soon made Lean-der fix his eyes U|>on it with admiration, and thoughhe devoted himself to the god of war, and gavelaws to nations, yet now the god of love put in togain a victory over him, who before bad been es¬teemed unconquerable, the queen of love seemedto guide his thoughts, and take up bis cogitations;lie wished be m';ght lay his laurels and trophies attins fair ladies feet, and found an inward fire kin¬dled, that made him love this fair stranger beforehe knew what she was, or what quality, yet couldguess by ah that appeared, she was no less thannoble: When bis triumphant chariot bad passedher, be could not but turn his eyes back to beholdher; and, like the love sick son to his fair Lancothe,was loth to go out of her sight; he thought onceor twice to order his attendants to enquire who shewas, hut then other thoughts countermandedthem, when he considered that his fame and glorywop hi be eclipsed, if just returned from the warsof Mars he should be suspected to incline to thesoft tents of Venus; so that without any inquiry,coming to the sea-side, he embarked his army onhoard the ships which lay ready to transport him5into Greece, when setting sail with a fair wind,whilst Neptune and his Tritons danced before him,he at length reached the jojful shores, filled withthe people from ail parts who came to welcome himwith music, songs &c., and thronged after him to hispalace of Abidos, where his father and mother withopen arms received him, and all the strtes of Greececame to congratulate his success, proclaiming aloudhis victories, and held ten day’s festival in theircapital cities, in honour of his brave exploits andachievements over so many nations.Leander, during the general rejoicing, was very1 thoughtful in disposing his army, and settling hisaffairs, which being done, he thought to betakehimself to repose after the tedious toil ot war, butbeauteous Hero opposed it; he thought she was al¬ways in hi« sight, for sleeping or waking his fancyand a 1 her dreams represented her unto him alllovely and charming, so that he could no longerstifle his flame, but signally shewed bv the a!tera-tion of bis countenance, that something inwardlydisturbed him ; bis parents and friends wonderingat so sudden a change, and not knowing the cause,urged him to discover it, but he, being very prudent,put them off with fictions.While Leander was at this pass, the fair Herono less surprised at the sight of him, represented toherself all that was great and worthy to be admiredin mankind, in him, so lhat their flames and pas¬sions were equal: tlio' either was ignorant of.it,she was so taken up with the thoughts of him, thatI it deprived her of her natural rest, ami was pleasedwith nothing more than to hear of the great actionshe had done, the relation of which was music toher ears, and joy to her heart, and often she wouldask Anaorissa, her nurse, who had brought her up,6in whom she alone confided, which she had heardof the famous Grecian capt nn since he had passedthe sea? This woman being of a ready and quickunderstanding, found bv the young lady’s oftenchanging colour, and sometimes hearing a sigh es¬cape when she spoke of Learider. that she hadmore than ordinary concern for him, resolving todive more deeply into her thoughts, she urged hermany times to know why she soeirnestly enquiredinto the fame and welfare of his person above allothers? But she answered'eitlier with silence, orthat she did no more in that than every body didof so brave a man: but one ni lit Amphiliabeing to watch in the chamber of the fair Hero,whose inward fire had, by burning to fierce,somewhat distempered her health she heard herin her slumber cry out, Oh ! hnw cruel is the godof love to'an innocent virgin to give such a sorrowfulwound without hope of cure ? She sc iree had saidthis, when she fancied in her dream as she after¬wards declared, she hehel i Leander standing byher in a most lovely and charming shape, and thegoddess Venus as it were presenting her with thesewords,Behold, fair maid, what you desire,His hre.xst I've fill’d with equal fire.Both shall enjoy what either craves,Till love is quench'd in Neptune’s waves.Having thus said, Leander seemed to embraceher and she him, very tenderly and with ardentaffection, when a great sea of water seemed to flowinto the place on a sudden, and parted them ; atwhich she started, between sleep and wake cried atin a fright, O my Leander! my love, how or wherehave I lost you ? and so awoke with rosy blushes7on her cheeks, and tears in her eyes* and beingtold of this by Amphilia: she could no longer denyher love, whereupon she promised her best assist¬ance, which she faithfully performed, as will here¬after appear.CH AP. II.Hok Leander passed ike sea to prosecute his lovev>itk Hero, and by xv/iat means he delivered herand her father from death, and slew a great num¬ber of their enemies that had beset them in a woodwith other particulars,'IT OVE having thus gained a double conquest,and both the lovers ignorant of each otherspassion, Leander grew impatient, forming in hismind many schemes how he might come to thespeech of his fair Hero, whose image had made sodeep an impression on his heart. At length heresolved to pass over into Asia as a private person,to wait there a while for a favourable opportunityof seeing his beloved, lie could see her castlefrom the shore of Europe, and often walked thitherfor that purpose: Going one day as usual, andfinding a small bark in a private harbour betweentwo rocks, he, without the knowledge of any one,agreed with the master to transport him to the fur-ther shore, which he did with a favourable gale,and landed him by the side of a forest, some dis¬tance from Sestus, the castle of his beloved Hero,and having dismissed the master of the bark with areward suitable to his labour, he set him down toconsider the best method to be taken withoutgiving oftence,He had not been there long before he heard dig-8mal cries as of people in distress, and presently aman all bloody and wounded came running out ofthe forest, whereupon mounting bis horse he hadbrought with him, he came up to the miserableparson, and demanding who had missed him? towhom, with a faint voice he reply’d, certainpirates lying in ambush in the forest, had set uponprince Armelious and his train, and had killedmany of them, yet those that remained, valiantlydefended their prince, therefore, for goodness-sake, said he to Leander, if you are generous,hasten to their assistance ere it is too late.Leander, who had always a noble soul, and tookgreat delight to relieve the distressed, needed notto be incited to such an enterprise, set spurs to hishorse, being directed to the place by the continuedcries, and found the prince, most of whose menwere slain, valiantly defending himself, his backbeing to a tree, against, nine or ten of the villains:he easily perceived who the oppressors were, andflying in amongst them like a tempest, beat alldown before him, cutting off the heads of some,and the arms of others as they were about tostrike, making there swords drop useless from theirhands; this put new courage into Armelious andhis wounded men, who yet survived their fellows,so that lustily laying about them, all but three ofthese pirates were slain, who, being likewisewounded, escaped among the trees; Armelioushad scarce time to thank the generous Leander,when bearing the cries of his daughter, whomothers of this rout were carrying away prisoner, hebesought him on his knees to bind his course toher assistance. Leander now all covered with theblood of his enemies, turned his horse to the path,followed the cry, and soon overtook them ; but9oh! how astonished was he, when lie saw, and knewthe lady, tho’ in tears and disorder’d, to be thebeauteous Hero, he lifted up his hands to heavenfor directing him to this forest, at a time when thefairest of creatures was in tlanger, and being ex¬cited by love anil revenge, fell upon them like athunderbolt breaking from a cloud, dying afreshhis sword, not dried from the former blood, atwhich the trembling lady died away to see suchfatal strokes, which at every blow brought deathto one or other of them, so that dispairing to carryoff their precious prize, when defended by onewhom they supposed to be much more than man,those that could, fled, and those that could not,left their livis behind them.By this time Armeliows and Ids company werecome to lend what assistance they could, andseeing fair Hero rescued, they would have fallen atthe feet of their deliverer, but be generously with¬held them from doing it, alledging that he haddone nothing but what all good and just men oughtto hazard iu such cases, to rescue the oppressed,and punish the oppressor; by this time the alarmbeing taken, a great crowd of people came flocsingfrom the neighbouring parts, with such weapon*as came first to their hands, and hearing whatwonders this stranger had done, and that it was tohis valour alone they owed the safety of their princeand his for daughter they saluted him with shoutsof joy, but his thoughts were so perplexed forHero, that he little regarded their applauses, forshe, by the fright, and seeing so much blood shed,was fallen into a swoon, but reviving at length, shewas put into a chariot that stood by the forest side,and conveyed to the castle of Sestus; Leanderbeing in this encounter unknown to her, by reason10his face was all covered with the blood of his ene¬mies ; Armelioos entreated him to go with him tothe castle, to which he seemingly consented, but itgrowing dark he took an opportunity to withdrawhimself till he might better consider how tomanage his love affairs; and so went that night toa neighbouring village where he refreshed himselfand presenting the master of the house with somejewels, desired him not to let any one know hewas there, it enquiry was made, which he promisedand performed.CH \P. 111.Hoiv Leander won n rich diamond in a tournament,which he presents to Hero, with a letter in itmanifesting his love ; and overthrew a great manymen that lay in ambush to tube hiS'lt/e.'H^TTERO being pretty well come to herself, made* ® a strict enquiry after her deliverer, and whenshe was told he nad secretly withdrawn himself,her eyes could not refrain from tears, that she hadnot a convenient opportunity to thank him for herdeliverance ; yet more, she could not but won¬der who this gallant stranger should be, and sentto divers places to enquire after him : sometimesshe thought it could be none but the fam’d Lean-ber, but those thoughts were again dashed with theconsiderations of his being passe 1 over in Europe,and taking up tiiere with the welcome of triumphsAfter many great rejoicings for this happy deliver¬ance, a solemn tilt and tournament was ordered,wherein the conqueior was to have a gdlden coro¬net set with diamonds, and other precious jewels,which glorious spot of marshal prowess was pro¬claimed by the heralds, which soon reachedLeander’s ear, whereupon, not to be behind hand,11left his lodging, and rod to Persepolis, a famouscity near at hand, and there bought a change ofarmour, having on his shield a flaming heart, onwhich the sun darted some rays through a cloud,with this inscription, She for whom 1 suffer is ignor-rant of my love.Leander thus accoutred, took an opportunity tocome to the tilt just as the trumpets were soundingto action, and found divers champions in readiness,well mounted, who upon the signal, ran two andtwo together, and broke their lances with diverssuccess, many being laid in the dust; but aboveall. the prince Persepolis, who was enamour'd of thefair Hero, and to whom her father designed hgrwed, unhorsed all that came near him : and thp’ hewas a man of an ill temper, and little beloved ofany, glorying in his achievements, in a braving man¬ner, came and demanded the prize, as his due,unless any other knight would dare to attempt apjthing further against him, Leander, who had altthis time stood still, that he might be crowned withthe greater victory, induced by those he tyad foiledand putting spurs to his horse, entered the list, anddemanded combat against him ; they no soonerencountered, but the prince was overthrown, to-gethered with his horse, as if he had been thunder¬struck, which disgrace some of his lollovver*attempting to retrieve, ran the same risk, so thatin the end none daring to appear against him, theprize was declared his, which he had no sooner re¬ceived, but he laid it at the feet of his most lovelyHero, telling her, That above ail the world, shaalone was worthy of so fair a diadem. She mostmodestly refused, and said, it was the prize of Hisvalour. But he entreated her in so particular amanner, that at length she accepted it, declaring12ahe would keep it for his sake. Many admiringthis, some with wonder, and others not withoutjealousy; prince Armelious was well pleased withit, as imagining this stranger could be no otherthan his gallant deliverer; and the jests beingended, he caused a lord near him to go and invitehim into the hall, where a sumptuous entertain¬ment wa< provided; but Leander, who had hisface all the while covered, and not yet willing todiscover himself, returned the prince his humblethanks in the most obliging expressions imaginable,and desired to be excused, saying, He had takenhis rep'St a'ready, and obliged himself by promiseto return as soon as the sport is ended.This speech satisfied the prince, in that he everheld, that a man of honour was always punctual tohis word: But the prince of Persepolis inwardfygrieved at this stranger s carrying away the gloryof the day, and fearing he might prove a rival in hislove (he being passionately enamour’d of the fairHero) sent twelve of his followers after him tomurder him, and then to bury him privately thatit might not be known.These men planted themselves in a wood he wasto pass, and when he came opposite them, they allrushed out upon him with their drawn swords, andgave him a furious assault; but he w ho was neverused to fear drew his trusty sword, that had neverfailed him, and laid about him so furiously, that ina very short time he sent eleven of them to keepcompany with the dead, while he that remained:fell on his knees and begged bis life, which hegenerously gave him, upon his confessing whoemployed them; at hearing which, Leander couldnot hut wonder how any nobleman could be guiltyof such baseness; and then comraasding him toJrISrise, Go, wretched man, said he, and tell thymaster, that treachery never prospers, and that Iwear a sword which may one day let him see thedifference between manhood and such ingloriousacts as these.The trembling man, glad his life was given him,having, by Leander’s orders, dragged his slaincompanions into the wood, with much thankful¬ness, took his leave: and related the fatal miscar¬riage, and also what Leander had given him incharge, put the prince of Persepolis into an extra¬ordinary rage, so that he foamed and cursed hismisfortunes; in which fret we leave him and return toHero.How when ihe fair Hero read Leander’s letter shewas transported with joy, and sent Amorissa herservant with a letter in search of him. How hekilled a cruel beast which was going to devour.Amorissa; with several other remarkable pas¬sages.OU have heard how Hero had received thepresent of Leander, which she curiously sur¬veying, perceived in the curious needle that adornedtbe cap of it, a little roll of paper thrust in, whichshe eagerly, but not without blushing, took out andread it in these words:‘ Fairest of creatures, it is not without cause,‘ that all that cast their eyes on you, beome lovers‘ and admirers of your noble perfections, pardon1 me then, if amongst the rest, 1 have presumed to1 gaze on so bright an object, which has not only4 dazzled my eyes, but penetrated my heart, and4 inflamed it with a desire to serve you: my life4 and fortune, madam, I lay at your feet, and byCHAP. IV.14' my obedience, if permitted to be rankee among’the number of your adorers,, I hope to gain some’ little spark of your condescending goodness to' love me, and give me at least your good esteem,’ when you come to know who your faithful servant’ is, who can no longer call himself your entirely’ must beg leave to subscribe himself your entirely’ defoted Leander.When the princess read this letter, she wastransported with joy and called Amorissa to con¬sult what was best to be done, and it was agreedbetween them that Amorissa should go in search ofhim with the following letter.Sir, though you are a stranger with whom I’ never had any conversation, yet the fame of’ Leander’s virtues and renowned deeds, which’ have taken up the discourse of ail the world, can-’ not. you may well imagine but have reached thei ears of Hero, and created in her an esteem worthy( of so deserving a person; bnt how you could( conceive so great a passion as you expressed int your letter, upon so slight a view, I cannot hastily( believe, since the greatest queen on earth wouldbe proud of Leanders courtship, and set a diademon his head lor love ; I think, if I mistake not, I’ owe my life, at least my liberty and my honour,’ which is dearer to me than both, to your valour,’and, therefore in gratitude return you my thanks’ and cannot but declare that it is just when I am’ an enemy to Leander, that I be so to myself,’ The rest 1 leave to the bearer, in whom you mayrepose any confidence, and so take leave to sub-’ scribe myself yours in friendship and good wishes’ Hero.’And as she was riding by the side of a wood,*he got information of such a person as she des-15cribed having entered the said wood a few hoursbefore. Araorissa immediately pursued the intel¬ligence she got. till she came to the place wherethe fight had been, where seeing the grass andleaves dyed with blood, she started in a fright andwould fain have returned/ but her steed being head¬strong, carried her away by force. She had notrode far before she heard a monster terribly roar¬ing, who had scented the blood of the slain, wasmaking towards them to satiate his hungry maw ;but upon hearing the noise of her horse’s feet,made after her at full cry, which unusual soundpiercing the ears of Leander as he sat by the sideof a rivulet washing off the blood and dust from hisface and armour, occasioned by the combat,whereat, clapping on his heimet. he came into theiway with) his drawn sword, perceiving a womanflying and crying; for help before a monstrousbeast, ho rpade haste to save her, but she throughfear falling down in a swoon, missing her, tore andrent the horse in a miserable manner. Leanderbeing come up, the monster made at him, with allhis might, and Leander with a home thrust piercedhis heart, that he fell down dead with a dismalcry, when he had done this he came to Amorissaand saluted her, who now' began again to recoverher senses; demanding what auventure had broughther such a dangerous way ? at these words,; open¬ing her eyes, and fixing them upon him, she imme¬diately knew him to be the person that had won! the prize at Sestus, and the man she was in searchafter, whereupon she fell at his feet, and, with tearsof joy in her eyes, said, Sure heavtji? is this dayfavourable to me, and to the fair Hero, in deliver¬ing me for death, and is i hope, putting an end toa more tedious search. t > .16Lemder, when he heard thenameof Hero, started,and a little after recovering him»elfagain, took Arao-rissa in his arms, and tenderly embracing her, said,for heaven's sake let me hear that heavenly soundagain. I think, continued he, you named Hero, Idid so, my lord, said she, and hope you are Leander,1 am so, said he: Whereupon she gave him theletter. Upon reading of which, he said, 1 am thehappiest man on earth, but think you, said he, Imay ever be so blessed as to see my Hero alone,and presume to te 1 hei my love without offending.Amorissa undertook this, but begged that affairsmight be carried or. as privately as possible for thatAltemansor, prince of Persepolis, had declared him-self a lover of the princess Hero, and by icason ofthe power he had in that country, and his influenceover the father of her mistress might much obstructtheir loves, if not make it prove of fatal consequence.To all this Leander consented, and gave himselfwholly up to be conducted by her management.CHAP. V.How Leander and Hero met, aud the mutuhl agree¬ment the// made ; and how Leander prepared to goto Sestus, to gain hirJalhers consent.HE joyful Leander now resolved to go to Sestusand took Amorissa (whose horse the monsterhad killed) up behind him ; by her directions theycame to a curious garden, about half a mile fromthe palace, to which Hero used, in the cool of theevening to resort ; of this palace she had the keys,and here the\ entered, where she left him till shewent and fetched her mistress; when the fair Herocame near the arbour where Leander was, he ven-17tured out, and with a low submission, failing at herfeet, thus expressed himself. Pardon me, divinecreature, if I thus presurre to prostrate myself be¬fore you, in hopes that so much goodness canpardon a crime of so high a nature, and especiallythis, seeing it is authorised by love, whose commandsmust be obeyed, and whose fijmes are irresistable.O turn not away tltose dazzling suns of light thatguide me to my happiness; hut let those orienteyes shine upon rne with beams of comfort that Imay live by the brightness of their lays, and thesmiles of my fair Hero. He would have proceeded,but Hero entreated him to rise, and Amorissa ad¬vising them to go into the arbour, as well to keepthem from the heat, as from the prying eyes thatmight be upon them: the two lovers obeyed, beingboth overjoyed at so happy a meeting. In the ar¬bour, whilst he gently squeezed her hand, which shepermitted him to kiss, she told him she hoped hewould not misconstrue her actions, in being so for¬ward in granting him favours she had never grantedto any one living : then it was agreed that he shouldmake his public appearance next day at the castleof Sestus, hut to he very cautious how he madelove to her in public, or shewed the least sign of it,till she knew how her father stoo 1 inclined to favourhim, for though she loved Leander entirely, yet shelooked upon the consent of her parents as material.CH \P. VI.Leander's fatal dream, and the treachery of the'prince of Peisepolis, to oppose his love. Hero’sfather entertains him tuilh joy, yet denies his con~sent, in favour of the prince of Persepolis.rjlHE best and constant lovers having had themutual satisfaction of an interview, and in their18hearts rnseperably linked by the chains of loveHero and Amorissa retired, and Leander resolvedto take up his abode, seeing the sun was near set,in that lodge till the next morning; when aftermany thoughts coming into his head he fell asleep,and fancied he had fair Hero in his arms, dancingon the waves and riding triumphant in Neptune’schariot, as if commanding the seas, when yEolus,the god of the wind, conspired with all his force,to raise a mighty and prodigious storm which over¬set his chariot; whereat, tor fear of losing Hero,who seemed to roll with him on the watery surge,lie started and awoke much troubled at such anunusual dream; but concluded it only the fancyof the night, and of his extraordinary love, hehushed those cares, and considered how to disposeof himself next day.Morning being come he laid his armour in a safeplace, and took only his horse, and went to thecastle of Sestus, where the bridge being down, andthe gates opened, he entered, and took him ssecret lodging in a little house in the remotestplace, where Amorissa often visited him, and diversletters passed betwixt him and Hero, who some¬times admitted him into her lodgings At lengthHero resolved, that if she could not gain herfather’s consent, she would without farther delayniarry Leander, and pass over into Greece withhim; but just as these thoughts filled her breast,her father came to charge her to entertain Alteman-sor’s love, laying before her the advantage of suchan alliance, the power and riches of that prince,&c. but she answered him with tears and entreaties,that she might not have a man she could not affect;this put the old man in a great rage, protesting notonly to disown her, but disinherit her forever, if19she disobeyed him. This news she sent Leanderin a letter all blotted with tears, which made himfor sometime like a man beside himself, but resolv¬ing to hazard all for his mistress, he concluded toappear like himself, and so in the most rich attire,which he sent for out of Greece, he appeared oneof the most goodly persons that had ever been seenat the court; so that all admired who this strangershould be till Hero’s father one day casting hiseyes upon him as he passed by, run to himwith tears in his eyes, crying out. O my deliverer!and good angel, have l found you again. How isit that you left us: alter you had saved us from adeath that was so near us? Leander made modestexcuses on thvt account, saying: It was no morethan in honour he ought to have down. The oldman was slid more abundantly transported whenhe knew it was prince Leander took him to thepalace, shewed him all the choice rarities ; andmade great feasting for several days, desiring himto demand whatever was in his power to obligehim with, and he would grant it immediately.Leander thinking now nas the time, said, sir,for all the favours you have done me, and the offersyou have made me I return you my most humblethanks; there is but one thing in the world Idesire of you, and if I could but think you wouldgrant me that, 1 would freely demand it, Demandthen, said he, said Leander, with your leave, toserve the princess Hero. 4t which he startedand looked pale, protesting that had he not alreadypromised her to Altemansor, there was no manunder heaven he could more gladly have bestowedher on, than Leander, whose fame and worth hadsufficiently spread over Asia and Europe; buthaving sworn to give her him before the high alter,he could not go hack from his oath ; or if he shouldhe being powerful in those parts, would take herby force, and lay his inheritance waste; but Lean-der told him, that should never be while he woro &sword. But no entreaties could prevail with himfor his consent; and Hero having promised to dierather than marry any but Leander, though shestood much upon her obedience, Leander could nottell, what to think would be the consequence. Socoming to Hero, told her the sad news, who gavehim fresh assurances of her love and constancy;w hereupon he told her the treachery of \Iteman-sor, and that neither him nor she were save on thatshore, but if she would go with him into Greecesecretly he would marry her royally there, butshe still insisted upon her obedience and told himthat time would molify her father’s heart.CHAP. VII.Hotv prince Altemansor hired one to poison Lean¬der, but tons prevented; hovo he afterwards at¬tempted to murder Leander in his bed, but washimself hilled upon the spot. With several moreremarkable passages ; concluding with the un¬happy death of these two unfortunate lovers."HJ V this time the news of Leander’s coming tocourt being known to Altemansor, the personthat had escaped having told him it was the samethat overthrew him at the tournament, and haddestroyed his men in the wood, lie was greatly en¬raged ; hut having secret notice he pretended loveto his mistress, he hired one of Leander’s servant#to poison him with a glass of wine, but as soon ashe was putting it towards his lips, it flew in pieces,21whereupon the wretch seeing the treachery dis¬covered, fell on his knees, begging pardon, anddisclosed the whole matter; upon which, this «n dthe former treacliery was published to the disgraceand anger of AUemansor. Hero’s father was muchdispleased with this, and went sharply to reprovehim which made him rage the more, and vowrevenge; yet knowing Leander to he a prince ofgreat courage, and having sufficiently tried hisstrength, he durst not challenge him to the combat,but thought if he could any ways destroy him, itwould open his way to Hero's love; wherefore onenight he broke into bis lodging with about 20 men,which creating some r.oice, Leander, who had nottime to put on his cloaths, got his sword, and de¬fended himself so well, that he kil ed the prince andmost of his followers, which-so alarmed the castle,that ad were up in nr ms, when Leander fearing tohe opposed, or that revenge would be taken for thisproud prince, made his retreat uood with theslaughter of his enemies, ami getting to a windowthat jutted into the sea, leaped into the waves, amiswam to the shores of Greece, and arrived safe atAbides . He thought for these many treacheries tohave brought over a powerful army, to have spoiledPersepolis. but the secrecy of his love, and desirenot more to offend Hero’s father, who was alreadyoutrageous for the death of Altemansor. he desistedthat resolve. He sent a trusty servant to hear howthings were resented, who ton!, him on his return,that his fair mistress was donfined by her father,<tqa little tower which jutted into the sea from thecastle, and there mourned her captivity and histybrnnosi' : ofaoi a vd fi9>ffi«« yinubht;? sew udLeander at tin’s was altogether impatient, andresolved at any terms to free her; whereupon hepot two of his tiusty servants to row him over in alittle boat, in the night time, and being furnishedwith a l?dderof ropes came safe under the window,and calling with a loud voice, Amorissa who wait¬ed on her mistress, soon heard him, and by hisdirection fastened the rope ladder to the beam ofthe window by which he entered. Hero, who wasjust awakened, trembled to see him there, hy reasonher father had promised if Leander should be taken,to deliver him up to Altemansor’s brother to bepunished, who was as cruel and as blood-thirsty asthe other had been; so that after many kisses andembraces, Leander endeavou-ed to persuade Heroto make her escape with him to Abides, but sherefused it, so that in this private manner ne ofte ivisited her; she setting in ike dark of night a torchlight in the window, to guide him to the tower.At length her father resolved to marry her withinthree days, though she had opposed it with hertears and prayers, to prevent a war and to atonefor his brother’s death. This tatal decree possessedHero with mot tat fears; so that she seeing no hopehut either to destroy herself or be forced into thearms of a man she hated for Leander’s profferedaid, in case of war, w’ould not be aecepted by herf .ther. she consented the next night he should comewith a small ship to fetch her and Amorissa withall her jewels and treasures into Greece; The over¬joyed Leander went back to prepare a vessel,which he soon did, and caused it to be drawn inbetween two rooks lest his purpose might he dis¬covered to the other shore, till it was evening, whenhimself being weary and lying down to slumber,he was suddenly awaked by a melodious songsung by two mermaids, who appeared dancing onthe waves.23nsrnob 11b SONG. - sift 1AWAKE Leantler, see the skies,Do In the blackest tempest rise ;In Neptune’s watery kingdomTwo lovers shall entombed be ;Whose hard mishap the sea gods all,With us lament their funeral:The cruel ghosts revenge to crave,And fate decrees them to their grave.We pity lovers that are crost,And in their highest hopes so lost:When nearest to the hopes they seem,And find all but a golhen dream:Then do cross winds bear away,Their hopes ; Leander, prithee stay;But thee too forward fate drives on,By love the best of lovers undone.Leander hearing this, admired much at it, andfound a little heaviness on his mind, however heresolved to keep his word. About sunset a reightytempest arose, the sea swelled in terror, and allseemed a sudden midnight, when as going towardsthe vessel he perceived it had broke its cable, andhad driven out to sea with the men on board it:he hailed them as loud as he could, but they stoodaway before the wind, and could not get back :Then he ran about the shore to seek another vessel,but could find none : so that seeing a light in Hero’sturret, by which he knew she expected him, heresolved to run any hazard rather than break hisword, and so stripping himself to his shirt, andhiding his cloaths in the rock, be leaped into thesea, in hopes to overtake the vessel, or find it at theplace appointed, and so floated on the waves till hewas half the sea over, when, as if all the elementshad conspired his ruin, rain, thunder, lightning andwinds handed him from wave to wave, calling toheaven, and on his fair Hero's name, till clashingamong the rocks on the other side, lost his noblelife; and Hero, who had impatiently expected himall that night, with greedy eyes looking out trem¬bling in the morning, and therp, by the too cruelfate of the rig'd destinies, she beheld his Oodyfloating on the waves; at this she cried out in alamentable manner, and calling upon his name,leaped out and perished in the waves, which, afterthey were dead, drove them on shore, folded arminarm; which sad tragedy being known, they werepitied by all, as the great examples of love and con¬stancy, and buried in one grave. Hero’s fathersoon after dying for grief, because of the cruelty hehad u?ed towards the lovers.F I N I £•iirI'aril linloa loo•-Ini Jiigtl « gnjaasd boiaaqxa oris« wa11a on riotriwHISOfCaril la li bnfl io ,hsrf llil tavaw aril noginiil Hniqonls os bCt 'tp *Aooi aril ni nrlicofj ^ul gnibi9fl) ajislravo ol a^qori ni

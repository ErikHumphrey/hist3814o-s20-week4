At this wedding was nivaliant lords and knights, mounted on stahorses to tilt and tourney before the noble lalthere present. After they had finished theirumphsaml mortal games, the duke of ('levels, an*bride and bridegroom, agreed to let the servtry their manhood at several pastimes, for two-jewels, valued at 3(K) crowns, which made theestrive one against another to do their best; scduke of Burgundy’s servant won one, and Ftsnatus the other.

Then she demanded of him, whatf,Gyntrytnan he was? he answered, I am uf Jisle of Cyprus, and poverty hath constrained n|to wander to seek my fortune. She said, fear netFortunatus, I am the goddess Fortune; and l!;jthe influence of the great Disposer of all thing*are given me six things to such as stand in ne<|thereof, which are wisdom, riches, siren"Lh, hcaltVhenuh/, and /ong life ; therefore choose one quicjffly, and be prudent, for you may not choose agaiiFortunatus made no longer stay, but said, then|desire richest With that she gave him a pun)and said, receive the same of me, and what cou;1try thou art in, as-often as thou shall put thy Iku 1therein, thou shall draw forth ten pieces of gc [i.of the same nation's coin : and this purse shall itain its virtue as long as thou livest, and thy ovi-children during their livesFortunatus returned her a thousand thanks, jwhich she replied, return thanks to the Giver |all good gifts ; for I am but the hand to distribi!'them as lie directs, and of thy riches bestow itthe poor and needy. Then, setting him out of tlwood, she vanished from his sight; which mainhim greatly wonder, and scarcely believe but it va vision, and nothing of reality in it, till comi!to an inn, he tried the experiment, and1 found sotherwise : hut his garments were so poor that tif!host, till he saw his money, scrupled to let him hslanv victuals or drink; but seeing him draw out g'jso fast, the began to be sweet.upon him, made hmfire, and carried him into the best room, orderjlhis daughter to attend him, where he staid |night. In the morning he inquired of the hoif he could help him to some horses, who t:ini, there was a merchant very lately arrived withiree very stately ones out ot Barlvary, for whichlie duke Rodolphus,who lived hard by, in a statelyastle, had offered 300 crowns, but it was refused.Fpon this he desired the host to send for the mer-rant, to bring his horses with him: which hescordingly did, though within himself he laughedi eartily, seeing him so meanly clad, and knowingicy were of great price; yet, contrary to his ex-ectation, he bought the two the earl had bid for,ad gave 400 crowns for them ; then the hostpposed him to be some nobleman in disguise,pecially as he bought costly saddles and otherrniture, and inquired for two servants. Theke heari-.ig that Fortunatus had bought thearses out of his hand, w’as very angry, and sentthe innkeeper to know who he was. The hostId the messenger he was a stranger in plain ha-t, newly come, which he at first did not thinkpable of purchasing an ass. Whereupon the earlnt to apprehend him, suspecting him to havemmitted some robbery, and notwithstanding alle excuses he could make sent him to prison, ands compelled to deliver the horses up to him,y 300 crowns, as a fine set upon him, and oil¬ed to depart his territories, with an oath neverdiscover what passed between them.8CHAP. III.IIoid Forlunalus travelled to the Isle of Cyprus, iv ]his Marriage, 6;c.For tun at us rejoiced that he was so well escape;and was not bereft of his precious purse; he ththought of travelling to his own country. In t l■country he passed through many strange citifwherein he viewed the greatest curiosities. Havi*now purchased several horses and rich apparel, v/1several servants to attend him, lie at last camelVenice, and thence sailed to the isle of CyprlUpon ids arrival at Famagosta, he found his iatl®.arid mother dead, through sorrow for their gnlpoverty, which much grieved him ; yet thatmight not be wanting in what lay in his power,built a stately monument over their grave, willsuitable epitaph.Fortunatus thinking now to settle in his ocountry, built him a noble house at Famago -ta,curiously adorned, that the like was not in 1island. He made splendid entertainments for 1king and queen, who highly favoured him, awondered whence he could be master of so gia treasure ; but he kept that a secret. At lastking advised him to marry, in order to keep u:family that was so ancient, and promised to 1?iris choices of the three daughters oi l ord Nine;upon which, having seen and discoursed with the4re made choice of the youngest, whose name va/9ssandra. The countess and earl liked well thetch, only they objected against him as he hadlands; which Fortunatus understanding, hechased a lordship to settle on her jointure. Thelidding was kept 14 days with great splendour,king, queen, nobles, and all of any note in thend, being entertained. And the first year ofs happy marriage, his beautiful Cassandra|»ught him a son, whom he named Ampedo ;: 1 the nest year another, whom he namedfdolocia.CHAP. IV.2V Fortun&lus was bent to travel a^ain ; which he.kdid, in Egypt, Persia, India, <Sfc.rtunatus having lived 12 years with his lovinge, now began to think of travelling into otherntries where he had not been; which his dearllssandra much opposed. But being fully resolved( travel, appeased her, promising, that he wouldfiurn in a yeat; and so leaving her, besides hisiate, ten thousand crowns, in ready money, in aIp he had hired for his own use, he departed,ving to turn merchant as weil as traveller.'he first port he touched at was Alexandria inypt, where, as the custom was, he immediatelyt to make a present to the Soldan, which hein such rich jewels, that that mighty princeired it, and therefore entertained him veryly, sending him in requital very rich merchan-e, and left him at liberty to traffic in the goodgs of Egypt, above the liberty granted to otherrchants; so that, having richly freighted hisship, he sent it by the master to Cyprus, consignelito the use of his wife and children, resolved wit:ten servants, to travel overland ; and so taking hileave of the Soldan, who gave him letters of sailconduct directed to divers princes, he determired to pass over the deserts of Arabia and Persisand so to India, taking Tartary in ins way, wherhe had a view of the great Cham’s court at CathkFrom whence he travelled through' a vast largforest that leads to India, where he slew a monstrous tiger, that had destroyed many hundreds cpeople, and left the way almost unfrequented bpassengers, which was scattered with the sculls an:bones of those that had been devoured. This forestook up two days and two nights travel, and passing through many countries, he came to Indifwhere the emperor Preston John reigned, who, call those those countries, was the only Christia.prince; that country being converted to the Christian faith by St Thomas the apostle. He has under him t>2 Kings, and is lord of 30 islands, besides a vast country on the continent. Ancthough most strangers are forbid to enter the en:peror’s palace, without his leave, Foftunatus, b:making large presents, soon gained admittanceand beheld such riches as the like he had never seen!';for the walls were plated with fine silver, whereon was engraved the stories of knights, and battleof former emperors : some rooms were hung wit ipanthers’ skins, fisting a fragrant smell; the pillarthat supported tire roof were cedar, overlaid wit:gold, and embossed'-with precious stones. Fortinatus, having seen all he could, obtained leave c|the Emperor to depart with 30 camels laden wit ’liie richest goods of the country, arid having ap*ointed his ship-master to meet him at Alexandria,e set-out from thence.The Soldian having noticeol his arrival in Egypt,nit divers of his officers to meet and welcome himi his name; whom Fortunatus presented withi wels, odours, and spices, and the Soldi ', withi oany rarities; so Unlading his camels, he ship-led all his goods, and remembring his promise tois beloved Cassandra, he ordered them to weighichor, resolving to sail; but the Soldian desiredi 5m to partake of a banquet before he went, afterli 'inch he shewed him Ids curiosities in his jewel-flouse, which were such as scarcely could be foundjlii the world. But while Fortunatus was admif-:pg their richness, the Soldian unlocked a cabinetl; gold, and pulled out of it an old hat to all ap-Stjearance, sayitlg, this is a jewel I esteem above al!pie others, for, continued he, it has that secret vir-jjie in it, given by a great magician, long sinceMead, that, put it upon your head, and wish to beirhere you will, you shall be immediately carriedjlnither invisibly. Fortunatus from that momentJjiought w himself, if lie had this to join withis purse, they would be the two greatest advant*ges in the world ; and said to the Soldian, sinceds hat hath such virtue, sure it must he veryCavy on his head that weareth it. Then said theoldian, it is no heavier than another hat, vvhere-pon he^gave it into his hands, and bid him nut itu his head ; asking him if he felt otherwise/Chen said Fortunatus, I did not think it had beeno light, nor supposed you would have set it on myead ! with that he wished himself in his ship : and' 1 112Jimmediately he flew out at the window, as swira* lightning, and, to the amazement of the sailors*lighted on the deck, without any harm ; they thenset all the sail they could, and, notwithstandingthey were pursued, safely reached the isle of Cy¬prus with his ship richly laden, to the great joy ofCassan -va and his two sons.Fertunatus, having lived long in pleasure and,plenty, his two sons being grown to men’s matu¬rity, he fell sick, and calling them to him, bestowedhis riches on them, revealed to them the virtue ofhis purse, and how it would last only for theirlives ; he also told them the virtue of his wishing-*hat. So desiring them to live lovingly together, and,not to part with these jewels, or ever discover thevirtues of them, but louse them by turns; andin a most devout manner, recommending hissoul into the hands of his Maker, he gave up theghost. Soon after Cassandra, through exceedinggrief, falling sick of a fever, died, and both were bur¬ied in a stately tomb he had caused to be built inbis life time, in the chancel of the new church hehad erected, having left bountifully to the poor,and for other charitable uses.iCHAP V.Ho w Andolocia, ihe youngest Son, got the Purse from j'Ambedo, his Brother, Sj'C.Fortunatus and his dear consort were no soon¬er laid in their tomb, but Andolocia, t he youngest ison, agreed with his elder brother, to fill four large *coffers with gold out of the purse; that he should13lif’.ve the wisbing-hat and aii the visible estate,and lie only the purse to bear him company inhis travels ; so setting forward he came to thecourt of Paris, in France, where he appeared sosplendid in his equipage, and extravagant in hisexpenses, that he was wondered at by all, whotook him for some strange prince, and rather byreason of his courage : for in the lists that weremade for entertainment, he unhorsed divers ofthe nobility. He soon after left the city, andtravelled for Spain, viewing all the rarities of thatcountry, and at length arrived at Madrid; therehe found them preparing for a war with Portu¬gal, and he resolved to take this opportunity,raised an hundred men, and preferred the kinghis service. The warsending, he sailed for Eng¬land, where, in like manner, he assisted the kingin his \vars with the Scots. And one dayvas theking was entertainingf him at dinner, he was sosmitten in love with the fair princess Agrippina,e king’s daughter, that he forgot to eat, andfeasted his eyes only on her, insomuch that greatnotice was taken of it. He likewise entertain¬ed the queen and princess at a splendid dinner,and afterwards the king, giving liberally to iheguards and servants, so that they marvelled howhe, having no visible estate, could live at such arate, and were greatly desirous to know what se¬cret mine he had to carry on his grandeur to sucha height.This, by the advice of the king and queen, theprincess undertook to discover, as she perceivedhe was deeply in love with her : and in a littletime shewed him such kindness, that he was ad-14rriltted to be private with her in her chamber, fifavour which none before had received : anti therebeing none but they, he thought it was now timeto declare his passion ; which he did in such oblig¬ing terms, that she seemed to be pleased with it,only saying, your lavishing expenses, I fear, willbring us both to poverty, should I marry witlr-you. He told her that could not be, for his treas-me during ids lite was inexhaustible, and couldnot be spent spend what he would. Let me know,said the princess, from whence you have thesegreat riches? Ah, said he, it was ray dying fa¬ther’s command not to discover it to any; yet sodearly do I love you that I can deny you nothing.To tins she obliged herself, and he, drunk withlove, thereupon shewed her his purse, told herhow it ivas come by, and all the secrets of it, let¬ting her see it experimentally, by pulling out sev¬eral handfuls of gold, which he presented herwith, telling her he could do so all day long, andevery day as long as he lived. This made herinwardly rejoice^ and from that time plotted howto get it, which she affected, under the colourof a promise he should-lie with her before mar¬riage, if he would swear to be true to her,when she had rendered up to him her virgin treas¬ure. But, whilst he expected, with a multitudeof joy, the fruition of her delicate body, she con¬trived with her woman to give him drugs in hiswine; and so drinking them lustily, befell fast a-sleep. Then turning aside his coat, she took hispurse, and fastened another of the same likeness fahis girdle, but different in virtue: so that waking inthe morning, and finding him in a chair, he be-gan to bonder what had befallen him. But justas he remembered the assignation with Aggrip-pina, in came her woman, who told him in a sor¬rowful tone that the fair princess going to bed,and keeping awake in expectation of him, and hedeceiving her, she was risen very angry. Thismade him Very bfank and sorrowful that he hadlost an opportunity which he could not reasonablyexpect again ! And so rising he Went to his ownhouse, little dreaming he had lost his treasure.By this time Agrippina had shewn the purse tothe king and queen ; and told them the virtue of it.And now they resolved to put a trick upon An-dolocia, and accordingly the king sent to tell him,he designed to come, with the queen and princess,to dine with him that day. The messenger hadno sooner delivered his message, and was departed,but he called his steward and bid him immediate¬ly provide provision : but he told him, in the twolast feasts that his money was all expended, and,therefore, he must have more. Whereupon An-dolocia put his hand readily into his purse butfound nothing: when looking wishfully on it, heperceived it was changed. This made him lookblank, not knowing lor a time what to say or do.He knew the virtue of it was so rare, that those whoh'ad it would never part with it by fair means.And so pretending his brother was dead, he tur¬ned of all his servants, sold all his household fur¬niture, and privately getting on ship-board, he sail¬ed for Cyprus', telling his brother Ambedo the la¬mentable news of the loss of the purse; whichgreatly grieved him, and made him blame Andolo-i: cia for his folly, and the breach of his father's last16commands. Yet he relieved his wants plentifullybut he as badly rewarded him, for having got whattreasure he could, he desired him to lend him hiswishing hat, but he a long time refused it, saying,that should be his last reserve when ali his moneywas spent, and he doubted not, but when somegreat prince should come to know the virtue of it,to get ten thousand pounds for it, and if he let himhave it.^he would lose it foolishly as he had donethe purse. T-o this he said nothing, but one daydesiring to see it, when having it in his hand, heclapped it on his head,wishing himself at Venice,and he was immediately there ; leaving his broth¬er to repent his folly in the loss of his hat, as hehad done his, in the loss of his purse. Being inthis great city, he found out several Jews whowere rich jewellers, and cheapening divers of greatvalue, grasping them fast in his hand and wishinghimself in England, he was immediately carriedthrough the air, to their great admiration, whoconcluded him to be no less than the devil.CHAP. VI.How Andolocia carried away Agrippina with thePurse to Ireland, t$’c.Bking in England, he disguised himself in thehabit, of an Italian merchant, and going.to court,inquired for the princess Agrippina, and beingbrought before her. he laid out his jewels, profer-ed her, them for sale, and in a little time they a-greed : Now that which he looked for was the purse,out of which he supposed she would take the money,17for lie suspected she had it, and accordingly it suc¬ceeded ; for going to a cofler and taking it out,she fastened it to her girdle : when lie having hiswishing hat on, clasped her in his arms, and wish¬ing himself in a wild desart, away they flew to¬gether over sea and land till they came to a vastwilderness in Ireland ; there he set her down faintand breathless, under a tree, on which grew verycurious apples to look to. Agrippina casting hereyes upon them, intreated him to pull some ofthem to quench her thirst, for she was almost rea¬dy to perish with drought. Yet he still lovingher, though she had played him such a slipperytrick, clapped unadvisedly his cap on her head tokeep off the scorching sun, as knowing she knewnot the virtue of it, so climbing up fell to gather¬ing. In the mean while she sat pensive and sad,and wishing to God she was out of that desolate ‘place, and in her father’s palace, ail on a sudden,contrary to her expectations, she was carried away,leaving Andolocia to fret at his foHy, and vex him¬self more than ever : so that, wandering up anddown, faint and weary, at length sat down by abrook, and fell to eating his. apples, when imme¬diately a grevious pain seized his head, so that hesupposed them infectious, and began to fear hislife : but on the contrary a great pair of goat’shorns sprung out ot his forehead, and then thepain ceased This made him wonder at himself,and stand amazed, but as he was sad and pensive,an old hermit came to him, and seeing him a stran¬ger, and in that condition, invited him lo his cave,and gave him such poor refreshment as he had,which consisted of nuts, wild apples, and roots,and Ids drink proceeded from a pleasant brookhard by; but Andolocia was more solicitous abouthis horns than any thing else, and intreated thehermit if he knew any way to cure him, and hewould give him ten crowns, which was all themoney he had left; for Agrippina had carried a-way all the jewels as well as the hat; but thoughhe promised to cure him, yet he refused his mon¬ey, telling him, he had returned from the world, •and the vanities of it, and money to him was use-less; but going abroad, he brought home six fairapples, two of which Andolocia had no sooner eat¬en, but.^iis horns dropt of, which made him great¬ly rejoice. So the good old man bidding him giveglory to God, led him out of the forest, and atthe edge of it they parted.Andolocia having some of the hornified apples,and likewise four of the contrary quality, beganto meditate revenge on Agrippina, and so comingwith ail speed to England, he got an opportunityto present them to her, as fruit grown in the ho¬ly garden of Jerusalem, to restore decayed beau¬ty and health for several years, make the agedlook young, and other wonders. But she had nosooner ate two of them, and finding a drowsiness,lying down to sleep, and dreaming she was turnedinto a goat; but awaking, she found a strange al¬teration and going to her glass, and seeing herhorns, affrighted, she startled 'and shrieked out,whereupon her ladies came about her, and wereas much affrighted at the sigiit as she: but agrave matron, who had been her nurse, advisedthem to be silent, to prevent the disgrace thatmight follow, till Physicians were consulted, whose19skill might take them away : she kept dose in herjdiamber, and the old woman was sent to diversdoctors, hot none of them would undertake it, onthe penalty she would impose on them, which wasten thousand crowns, if she revealed the lady'sname, and they did not cure her. But as she wascoming back again very pensive, Andolocia, in thegarb of a physician, met her, and told her, by hersadness, and coining from such a doctor’s house, heguessed she had some dear friend in danger of life,or some other great distress which, if she would ac¬cept of his services as a physician, he would, nodoubt, with the blessing of God, be able to cure her.The old woman believing him, greatly rejoiced thatshe had found him so opportunely; and telling himthe whole matter, which he very well knew before,conveyed him to the princess’s chamber privatelyat a back door, where he found her lying on herbed very much troubled: but she was comfortedwhen he told her he was come to cure her, sohe began to make application, and gave her so lit¬tle of the apple among her drugs that they onlywasted by degrees; then telling her he wantedsome costly drugs, to make them, come off by theroots, and so she should be more beautiful thanever. She arose and went to her coffer in themean while. "Searching about the room, he foundhis wishing-hat carelessly thrown under the bed,for she knew not the virtue of it, hut supposedsome spirit had conveyed her backward and for¬ward before : by this time she called him to receivethe money, and, drawing her toward the windowthat he might,'as he pretended, the better discernit, drew his hat from uglier his coat, clapped it on£0his head, grasped her in his arms, and away lieflew with her, purse ami all. In this airy voyageshe was carried to Flanders, where presentinghimself lo her in his true shape, and with a sterncountenance, reproaching her with her treacheryand inconstancy, she {Jell on her knees and beggedhis pardon. Whereupon, taking pity on her, ather request he put her into a nunnery, givingthe abbes two hundred crowns for her admit¬tance, promising to' fetch her as soon as he couldfind a remedy to take oft' her horns; and so de¬parted for Cyprus with his hat and purse, thesight of which greatly rejoiced Ampedo, to whombe told all the passage of his travels ; and so ex¬tolled the beauty of Agrippina, the prince of Cy¬prus, enamoured on bare report, prevailed withthe king his .father to send an embassy to desireher in marriage. On this Andolocia was solici¬ted to free her from the nunnery, which he did,taking of her horns, and carrying her through theair to London ; and so with a noble train of lordsand ladies they sailed for Cyprus, where she wasroyally received and splendidly married.This made many of the nobles envy Andolocia,especially tiie earls of Ammndalia and Limousevowed his death, who had so much eclipsed theirhonour; and so setting on him, and his six men,as he passed one day through a wood, they, andtheir hundred attendants, after a long fight killedhis men, took him prisoner, for he had not withhim his wishing-hat, and casting him into a darkloathsome dungeon, set him in the stocks, andloaded him with irons, to make him confess whencehe had those.vast riches; which, through torment,he discovered, and gave them his purse, and theyhaving proved the experiment, thought themselvesnot safe whilst he was alive, because they knew hecould tiy through the air, and so might escape, theyoffered the gaoler the money to despatch him pri¬vately ; but he refusing, the earl of Armundaliastrangled him as he sat in the stocks.In the mean time, while Arnpedo was inconsol¬able for the loss of his brother, having in vain of¬fered great rewards for his discovery, at lengthsupposing him dead, burnt his wishing-hat, andthrough grief died, soon after the earls were ap¬prehended and examined, who confessed the factin all its circumstances, for which they were bothbroken on the wheel.There was once upon a time, a-widow, who hadtwo daughters. The eldest was so much like herin the face and humour, that whoever looked uponthe daughter, saw the mother, they were both sodisagreeable and proud, that there was no livingwith them. The youngest who was the very pic¬ture of her father for courtesy and sweetness oftemper, was also one of the most beautiful girlsever seen. As people generally love their ownlikeness, tin's mother even doted on her eldestdaughter, and at tiie same time, had a horrible aver¬sion for the youngest. She made her eat in thekitchen, and work continually.Among other things, this poor girl was forced,twice a-day, to draw water about a mile and ahalf off tire house, and bring home a pitcher fullof it. One day, as she was at the fountain, thereenme to her a poor woman, who begged of her tolet her drink. “ O ay, wfth all my heart, Goody,”said this pretty little girl, and rinsing immediatelythe pitcher, she took some water from the clearestpart of the fountain, and gave it to her, holding upthe pitcher all the while, that she might drink theeasier.The good woman having drank, said to her“ You are so very pretty, my dear, so good, and somannerly, tiiat I cannot help giving you a gift,(for this was a Fairy, who had taken the form ofa poor country woman, to see how far the civilityand good manners of this pretty girl would go.)I will give you for gift, (continued the Fairv) thatat every word you speak, there shall come out ofyour mouth either a flower or a jewel.”. When this pretty girl came home, her motherscolded at her for staying so long at the fountain.“ I beg ypur pardon, mamma, said the poor girl,for not making more haste and in speaking thesewords, there came out of her mouth two roses, twopearls, and two diamonds. What is it T see there?said Her mother, quite astonished, I think I seepearls and diamonds come out of the girls mouth.How happy is this child ! This was the first time,ever she called her child.The poor creature told her frankly all the matter,not without dropping out infinite numbers of dia¬monds. “ In good faith, cried the mother, I willsend my child hither. Gome hither, Fanny, lookwhat comes out of vour sister's month, when shespeaks, wouldst not thou be glad, my dear, to havethe same gift given unto tfiee, thou hast aothing23else to do but go and draw water out of the fount¬ain, and when a certain poor woman asks you tolet her drink, to give it to her very civiijy. Itwould be a very fine sight indeed, said this iil-bredminx, to see me go draw water. You shall go,hussy, said the mother, and this minute. So a-vvay she weot, but grumbling ali the way, takingwith her the best silver tankard in the house,She was no sooner at the fountain, than she sawcoming out of the wood, a lady most gloric.islydressed, who came up to her, and asked to drink.This was, you must know, the very fairy who ap¬peared to her sister; but had now taken the airand dress of a princess, to see how far this girl’srudeness would go. ‘ Am 1 come'hither, said theproud saucy slut, to serve you with water, pray ?I suppose the silver tankard was,brought purelyfor your ladyship: was it ? However, you maydrink of it if you have a fancy.”“ You are not over and above mannerly,” an¬swered the fairy, without putting herself into apassion: “ Well then, since you have no breeding,and are so very disobliging, l give you for gift,thatat every word you speak, there shall come out ofyour mouth a snake or a toad.'’ So soon as hermother saw her coming, she cried out, “ Well,daughter ” c: Well mother,” answered the perthussy, throwing out of her mouth two vipers andtwo toads. “ O mercy f’ cried the mother,“ what is it I see! O, it is that wretch her sister,who has occasioned all this; but she shall pay foritand immediately she ran to beat her. Thefloor child fled away from her, and went to tiidelerself in the forest not far from thence.—-The24king’s son then, on his return from hunting, mether, and seeing her very pretty, asked her, ‘ Whatshe did there alone, and why she cried ?’ ‘ Alas,Sir, my mamma has turned me out of doors.’ Theking’s son, who saw five or six pearls, and as ma¬ny diamonds come out of her mouth, desired herto tell him how that happened. She thereupontold him the whole story ; and so the king’s sonfell in love with her, and considering with him¬self that such a gift was worth more than anymarriage-portion whatsoever in another, conduct-tcd her to the palace of the king his father, andthere married her.As for her sister, she made herself so much ha¬ted, that her own mother turned her off; and themiserable wretch, having wandered about a goodwhile, without finding any body to take her in,went to a corner in the wood, and there died.FINIS.

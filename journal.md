# Journal — Week 4

> Think about how the various authors in the readings make the case for how digital history arguments are advanced.



> Think about the cycle of jumping from close to distant ‘reads’ or ‘views’ of your material, and the ways the stories emerge - or not.



> What is missing from historical argumentation in digital history?



> What is different about this process from what you have come to experience as historians in other classes?



> How do the particular affordances of digital work change what you might know - and how you might argue it?



> How much (or what) *a priori* knowledge is a requirement for digital history arguments to make sense to a reader/viewer/user?

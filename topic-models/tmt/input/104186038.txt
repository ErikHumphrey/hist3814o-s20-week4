I. L. K.—and paused—“ Well, sir, what’s that“ I cannot tell,” the boy all trembling said—Not tell, you little blind and stupid brat;Not tell,”—roar’d Jonas in a violent rage.And quick prepared an angry war to wage—“ Tell me this instant, or I’ll flay thy hide—Come, Sir,Dost thou this birchen weapon see ?What puts thy mother in her tea ?”With lifted eves the quaking rogue reply’d,RUM, Sir. . .”i3ALONZO THE BRAVE.A warrior so bold, and virgin so bright,Conven’d as they sat on the green ;They gaz’d on each other with tender delight,Alonzo the Brave was the name of the knight,The maid was the Fair Imogene.“ And ah,” said the youth, “since to-morrow I goTo fight in a far distant land ;Your tears for my absence soon ceasing to flow,Some other will court you, and you will bestowOn a wealthier suitor your hand.”“Oh, hush these suspicions,” fair Imogene said,“ So hurtful to love and to me ;For if you be living, or if you be dead,I swear by the Virgin, that none in your steadShall husband of Imogene be.“ And, if e’er for another my heart should decide,Forgetting Alonzo the Brave,God grant, that to punish my falsehood and pride,Thy ghost at my marriage may sit by my side.May tax me with perjury, claim me as bride,And bear me away to the grave.”To Palestine hasten’d the warrior so bold.His love she lamented him sore ;But scarce had a twelvemonth elaps’d, when, be¬hold,A baron, all cover’d with jewels and gold,Arriv’d at fair Imogene’s door.His treasure, his presents, his spacious domain,Soon wado her untrue to hex vows;HHe dazzl’d her eyes, he bewilder’d her brain,He caught her affections, so light and so vain,And carried her home as his spouse.And now had the marriage been blest by thepriest,The revelry now was begun ;The fables they groan’d with the weight of thefeast,Ndf yet had the laughter and merriment ceas’d,When the bell of the castle toll’d—Oxe !"fwas then, with amazement, fair Imogene foundA Stranger was plac’d by her side ;His air was terrific, be utter’d no sound,He spoke not, he mov’d not, he look'd not around,Hitt earnestly gaz’d on the bride.His vizor was clos’d, and gigantic his height.His armour was sable to view ;All laughter and pleasure were hush’d at his sight,The dogs, as they ey’d him, drew back withaffright,And the lights in the chamber burnt blue.His presence all bosoms appear’d to dismay,The guests sat in silence and fear ;At length, spoke the bride, while she trembled—“ IpraySir Knight, that your helmet aside you would lay,And deign to partake of our cheer.”The kdy is silent—the stranger complied,And his tizor he slowly unclos’d—15o 064s,- #hat & Sfgttt met Im-egeW6 s ef&),What words can express her dismay and Siitpriso,Wlien a skeletoti’s head M'M exposed.;j All present then utter’d a terrified shout,''And turn'd With disgust from the scene ;The worms they crept in, and the worms they creptout,i And sported his eyes and temples about,While the spectre address’d Imogene:“ Behold me, thou false one, behold me,” he cried,“ Behold thy Alonzo the Brave ;P God grants, that to punish thy falsehood and pride,My ghost at thy marriage should sit by thy side,! Should tax thee with perjury, claim thee as bride,And bear thee away to the grave.”This saying, his arms round the lady he wound,While fair Imogene shriek'd with dismay ;Then sunk with his prey through the wide-yarn¬ing ground,Nor evtr again was fair Imogene found,Or the spectre that bore) her away.I Not long liv’d the baron, and none, since that time,To inhabit the castle presume ;l7or chronicles tell, that by orders sublime,There Imogene suffers the pain of her crime,And mourns her deplorable doom.' • V 1 ** , * .1 JO Pv.At midnight four times in each year does her sprite,When mortals in slumber are bound,Array’d in her bridal apparel of white,Appear in the ball with her skeleton knight,And shrieks as ho whirls her around.16While they drink out of sculls newly torn from thgrave,Dancing round them pale spectres are seen ;Their liquor is blood, and this horrible staveThey howl, “ To the health of Alonzo the Brave,And his consort, the false Imogene.”THE OLD MAN, HIS SON, AND ASS.A country fellow and his son, they tellIn modern fables, had an ass to sell:For this intent they turn’d it out to play.And fed so well, that by the destin’d dayThey brought the creature into sleek repair,And drove it gently to a neighb’ring fair,As they were jogging on, a rural classWas heard to say, “ Look, look there at that ass.And those two blockheads trudging on each side.That have not either of ’em sense to ride ;Asses all three,” and thus the country folksOn man and boy began to cut their jokes,Th’ old fellow minded nothing what they said.But every word stuck in the young one’s head,And thus began their comment thereupon :“ Ne’er heed ’em, lad“ Nay, father, do get on“ Not I, indeed “ Why then, let me, pray“Well, do, and see what prating tongues will say."The boy was mounted, and they had not gotMuch further on, before another knot,ITJuit the ass was passing by, pad, pad,Cried, “ O! that lazy looby of a lad,How unconcernedly the gaping bruteLets the poor aged fellow walk a-foot. ”Down came the son, on hearing this account,And begg’d, and pray’d, and made his fathermount;Till a third party on a farther stretch,"See! see!” exclaim’d, "that old hard-heartedwretch!How like a justice there he sits, or squire,While the poor lad keeps wading through themire.”" Stop,” cried the lad, still deeper vex’d inmind,1 " Stop, father, stop, let me get on behindThis done, they thought they certainly should| please, escape reproaches, and be both at ease ;I For having tried each practicable way.What could be left for jokers now' to say?Still disappointed by succeeding tone ;■ “ Hark ye, you fellow, is that ass your own?1 Get off, for shame, or one of you at least;You both deserve to carry the poor beast,I Ready to drop down upon the roadf With such a huge, unconscionable load.On this they both dismounted, and, some say,• Contriv’d to carry, the remaining way,The ass between 'em ; prints are seen, they add.’ The ass supported by the man and lad ;1 Others omit that fancy in the print.As overstraining an ingenious hint.IThe story that we follow, says, the manKubb’d down his aes, and took to his first plan $Walk’d to the fair and sold hhn, got his price,And gave his son this pertinent advice :“ Let talkers talk, stick thou to what Is best;To think of pleasing all is all a jest.”UN THE HuWNFALL QE POLAND,And Hope, thy sister, ceased with thee to smile,O sacred Truth, thy triumph ceased a while,When leagued Oppression poured to Northern warsHer whiskered paudours, and her fierce hussars.Waved her dread standard to the breeze of morn.Pealed her loud drum, and twanged her trumpethorn ;Tumultuous horror brooded o'er her van,Presaging wrath to Poland—and tp man.Warsaw’s last champion from her height sur¬vey’d,Wide o’er the fields a waste of ruin laid,—“0 Heavens,” he cried, “my bleeding countrysave!Is there no hand on high to shield the brave ?Yet, though destruction sweep these lovely plains,Rise, fellow men, our country yet remains ;By that dread name we wave the sWord on high,And swear for her to live—with her to die.”He said, and on the rampart heights arrayed,His trusty warriors, few, but undismayed :Firm-paced and slow, a horrid front they fonn.Still as the breeze, but dreadful as the storm.Low, murmuring sounds along their banner fly,Revenge or death—The watchword and reply;Then pealed the drum, omnipotent to charm,And the loud tocsin tolled their last alarm.• r''-lift h . ; • >*/In vain—alas, in vain, ye gallant few,From rank to rank your vollied thunder flew j0, bloodiest picture in the book of time,Sarmatia fell, unwept, without a crime ;Found not a generous friend, a pitying foe,!

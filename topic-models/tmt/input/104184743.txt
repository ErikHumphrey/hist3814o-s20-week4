They’d lock me to the horse's side.But when I came to Stocklock town,pE The girls about me docked roun’,ft And said, young man what is your crime ?i For the stroking of a maiden’s wame.When I came to the turnkey’s house,B He look’d at me mute as a mouse,11 said. We’ll have another cup,14 No my lad, you must tumble up.GBut when I came into the yard,The prisoners flocked round there,They came to me wit! b-it if har d,Sayi'g, Vou’re welcome hciS young man.There was four doors for to tre through,The mos-l of them <' could undoThere w^s four locks on tnese tour doors,Which made me cty, hang all whores.At i'rx o’clock th turnkey came,A>d <ook from mo my g- rtors,He lock'd me in a dungeon dark,AH right to take my qmrtersBm in the mon.ing when I rose,I found myse’f drest i^ my clothes ;My beu it was a bed of suawWhich made.me cry, hang such law.But now I am come out’ngain,And on the road a oinring ;For tradt is bad and we pooi ladl,Go out a privateering.'

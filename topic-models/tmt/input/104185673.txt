S RESOLU FION.A .Beggar, a beggar, a beggar I’ll be,For none lives a life fo jovial as he;A beggar I was, and a beggar I am,A beggar I’ll be, from a beggar I came ;And if that it happens our trading (hould fail,We, in the conclufion, lhall beggars be all:Tradefmen ate unfortunate in their affairs,And few men are thriving but courtiers or players.fli carver my father, a maunder my mother,A filer my filler a filcher my brother,A canter ray uncle, who values no pelfjA lifter my aunt, and a beggar myfelf:In white wheaten ftraw, when their bellies were full,There f was begotten, ’twixt tinker and trull,And therefore a jolly brave beggar I’ll be,For none lives a life lb jovial as he.VVhen boys they come to ns, & fay their intent is,To follow our calling, we ne’er bind them ’prentice ;Soon as they come to’t, we learn them to do’t.We give them a Half, and wallet to boot;We learn them our lingo, to crave and to cant,So the devil is in it if e'er they can want;Therefore, he or (he that a beggar will be,Without an indenture may foon be made ftee.We beg for our bread, yet fometimes it happens.We feall it on pig, pullets, conies, or capons;For churchmen’s affairs, we are no men flayers,We have no religion, yet live by cur prayers:And oft when we beg, & men draw not their puifes.We charge and give fire with a volley of curies;Then the devil confound your good ^orlhip we cry.And fuch a bold brazen Dic’d beggar ara I.We have things in feafoa, & have fo much reafon,We raife no rebellion, nor ever talk treafon ;We bill with our mates, at very low rates,Yet fofrte keep their quarters as high as their gates.( s )With Shenkin, or Morgan, or Loufinan, or Teague,We into no covenant enter, or league,And therefore a jolly bold beggar I’ll be,For none lead a life fo jovial as he.For fuch pretty pledges, as {hirts from the hedges.We never do fear being drawn upon fledges.Yet fometimes the whip does make us to Ikip,And then we from tithing to tiihing do trip:But when in a poor boozing-ken we do bib it,We are more afraid of the flocks than the gibbet;And if from the Hocks we keep out our feet.We fear not the Compter, Kings-bench or the Fleet.Sometimes we frame ourfelves to be lame,And when a coach comes, we hop to our game:We Icldom mifearry, or ever do marry,By Gown, common prayer, or Clerk Direftory:They laugh, and they kifs, & they !y down together.Like pigs in the peafe, intanglcd they lie,And there they begot luch a beggar as I.The T O P E R ’ S DELIGHT.To it*own proper Tune.Contented 1 am, and contented I’ll be,for what can this world more afford.Than a girl that will fociably fit on my knee,and a cehar that’s very well ftor’d my brave boys,and a cellar that’s very well flor’d.My vault door is open, defeend every gueft,broach that calk, aye, that wine we will try :’Tis as fweet as the lips of your love to the tafle,and as bright as her cheek to the cje.In a piece of flit hoop 1 my candle have ftuck,it will light us fach bottle to hand,The foot of my glafs for the purpofe is broke,for I hate that a bumper fhould ftand.( <5 )We are dry where we fit, tho’ the oozing drops feem,the rnoift walls with wet pearls to embofe,From the arch mouldy cob webs in gothic tafte ftream,like fiucco-work cut out of mofs.Aftride on a butt, as a butt fliould be ftrode,i fit ray compraions among,Like grape blelling Bacchus, the good fellow’s god,and a fcntiment give, or a fong.I charge fpoil in hand, and my empire maintain,view that heap of old hock in the rear;Yon bottles of Burgundy, fee how they’re pil’d,like artillery tier over tier.My cellar’s my camp, and my foldiers my flalks,all glorioufly rang’d in review ;When i caft my eyes found, I confider my calks,as kingdoms I’ve yet to fubdue.Like Macedon’s madman, my drink I’ll enjoy,in defiance of gravel and gout,Who cry’d, when he had no mere worlds to fubdue,i’ll weep when my liquor is out.When the lampis brimful, fee the flame brightly Ihinesbut when wanting moifture decays;Replcnilh the lamps of my life with red wine,or elfe there’s an end of my blaze.’Lis my will when I die, not a tear Ihould be (bed,no Hie Jacet be cut on my (tone ;But pour en my coffin a bottle of red,and fry, A choice fpirit is gone, my brave boys,and fay, A choice fpirit is gone.$*&*&*&*&*^*&*&*^The Return of the S P RING.MY mules, don't fail, to the (pring give all hail,Yu the pleu'fantctt time of the year:When the fun doth accoft, (how mountains & froft,Hiake their hoary heads to difappear.(?)Then like bees from a hive, men dart up reviv’d,at the fight of bright Phoebus’s ray;Some whiftie, fome fmg; all welcome the Spring,which drove the cold Winter away.The peafant and peer, with fpirits that’s clear,repairs jo their fabour and fport,The dourt, and its date, with atiendants that’s great,to the gardens and fields do rclbrt.In the Spring of the year, when the ladies appear,in colours all glorious and gay,"Which nothing furpafs, but lilies^and graft,that drove the cold Winter away.See trees how they bud, fee birds how they find,hear cows how they low for their young,On each rape and bufh, the black bird and thrulh,in concert join chorus and long.See fowls of the air, how they lovingly pair,fee lambs how they (kip all—and piay:In mirth there’s no bounds, all nature relbunds,Which drives the cold Winter away.The ploughman with fpeed, and a fack full of feed,the carter drives out with his teams;The (hephcrd with crook, and the angler with hook,repairs to the vallies and ftreams.The farmer with brake, and the giyd’ner with rake,all chearfully work out the day ;Sdme whiftie, fome ling, all welcome the Spring,which drove the cold Winter away.Let mifery pack, and a whip at her back,down down the tartarian flood:And let envy be drown’d, with malice new crown’d,he who envies any man’s good,May good fortune attend ev’ry merry man’s friend,that does the btft that he may:Forgetting all wrong, in a cup and a long,we’ll drive the cold Winter away.(«') - - ;A NEW SONG.MY love waits on a lady fair,And 1 do belong to a flout privateer;Rich prizes we have taken fince the war did begin.From the lofty Monfieur and brought them fafe in.And all thole rich prizes my true love Ihe (half lhare,And richeft of apparel my true love fhall wear,AVith gold rings & diamonds my true love I’ll deck,With a broad chain of gold to wear round her neck.I’ll fer my love a lodging in yonder valley fo fair.Near lotne chryftal fountain to take the frefli air,And I’ll buy my love a fpinnet for to play upon,And vs c’ll live as happy as Darby and Joan.And when that money begins to grow fcant.I’ll away to the feas, for my love fliall not want;I’ll away to the lea boys, where loud cannons do roar.And we’ll bring home rich prizes as we’ve done before.So fare you well father, and fare you well mother^Fare you well fifter, and adieu to my brother;Fare you well friends and comcrades allb,For I am bound a failing where I do not know.All you noble ladies wherever that you be,Don’t you flight a bold lailor that fails on the lea,Don’t you flight aboldleaman thatploughson the mainFor richly he’ll clothe you when he returns again.O ihe moon (hall be dark’ned & give no more light,i The flats in the firmament (hall melt in one night,The tide in the ocean it never (hall be,li ever I prove falle to my charming Polly.FINIS.

Or, who wouldherd with Sharpers, and not expert to becheated ? Therefore, my advice is, to Ihun ,thefe reptiles of the creation, fraught withguile, and artful as the ferpent, to delude, iBeware of their conversation, fhun theircompany, take no notice of their tncks andi incies, nor be baught with their wheedlingprofeliions of friendfilipt lifter, not untothem or ineir enticements, il you wouldpre- '( IS )j preferve your peace and property.

To expofe their pernicious prac¬tices, and the bad efie£ts produced thereby,may in fome meafure Hop the progrefs ofthis growing evil, and tend to crufh thehydra before it has power to do furthermifchief: I lhail therefore be as exacl aspoffible in relating one or two of the moftglaring and flagrant deceptions practifedon the unwary, in order to give the readeran infight into the nefarious and audaciousproceedings of Swindlers, that they maybe( *6 )be enabVd* to prevent any future attemptsoi tne nature upon them by tli-fe peftsi •of locieiy. This new '’pecies of knavery,|carried on by Swindlers, appears fpecious Win itfelf, tie pra&itioners thereof fetting |themfelves up for men of property and in- I •tegrity, the mare c-afily to defraud the un- rvrary and ignorant out of their fubllance |and effects; to obtain w'hich, among n>any,the following is pra&ifed: A number ofthem, being connected together, take a gen¬teel houfe in a reputable part of the town,and divide’themfelves into clafles of makers, |clerks, out-riders, fliopmen, porters, and |fervants. From their making a fhew of» opulence, they eafiiy obtain credit, and lay |lin goods of every kind, which they f£nd !into the country, and fell or barter forether commodities, which they bring upto London and fell for ready-money, gene¬rally taking in exchange double the quantity,and paying for the fame with notes of theirown drawing, indorfmg, and fabricating, lorthe purpoft-s of cheating the poor deludedfarmer, fliop-keeper, and tradefman, in theinterior parts of the country. With refpedl |to '.f^delhien in town, the goods they take Uof tiiem on truil, they difpofe of to jews, H'.g” and Iand other receivers of Rolen gooes, at aboutthirty per Cent under value, for ready-money, nay fifty per Cent, rather than nothave the cafti: And, as their flay in a placecannot fafely be above fix months, on ac¬count of their creditors calling in their debts,and their country notes becoming due, theymake all poflioie difpatch to difpofe of thevarious articles, and evacuate the prevnifesbefore detection. This done, they play the■ fame game elfewhere, wh- n, Proteus-like,they change fhapes, and difguife themfelvesfo, as not to be known, and carry on ano¬ther houle, but in a different name and man¬ner; the mailer becomes the rider, the rider,the mafler, the clerks defeend to footmenand porters, the porters and footmen toclerks, and fo on throughout, till they havedrain .d many parts of town and country,to the ruin of many worthy and hone.l menj in bufmefs.These Swindlers have been very artfultin evading the law, in negotiating the badnotes they had circulated about the country.I tiey are generally done on copperplates,as neatly as the banker's: fonie.of tbemare drawn at fight, . thers at a longer ori fitorter date, as luits their conveniency,;( i2 )the drawer carries them about him all over |the country, and difpofes of them, a fecondflindorfes, a third accepts, but none to pay. jjBut notwithftanding all the arts and in-|finuations of thefe Swindlers, they are eafily Ifmgled out in company, from a pretended jlhurry in bufmefs, and fear of deteftion ; |eyeing every perfon alkmce, doubtfu^ of [having feen them before.PICKPOCKETS.There are more Pickpockets in andabout London, than in all Europe befide,that make a trade, and what they call acomfortable living, by their employment.— :The Opera, Play-houfes, Capital Auctions,and Public Gardens, fwarm with them; 'and, of late years, they have introduced uthemfelvcs-into our very Churches, in which E .they have not been lefs fuccefsful, at acha- ;ritv Sermon preached by a Romaine, orother noted orator, than at the Theatres, !::at a Benefit, when the principal parts have •been played by a Kemble, Siddons, Jordan, .Incledon, Muncbn, ivud other firfl-rate per¬formers. To fet forth the different ways ^by E( 19 )5jr which they fucceed in their nefarious3ra£Vices, would he tedious; therefore I {hallcnly obferve,that in general two go together,one before and the other behind the personivhofe pocket is to be picked ; the formerof which flops the perfon, either in a croud,pr by a pretended accident, while the otherpffe&s the bufmefs. Therefore it would beprudent, when in crouds, to keep one handon your money, and the other on yourwatch, when you find any one pufh againfeyou : But, fhouid you be robbed for wantof taking proper care to prevent the fame,take no notice till you fee fome perfon nearyou Healing away, when you are to fecure .him or her, and ten to one but you fix onthe right perfon. You mull, however, becareful to lay hold of their hands, for fearof their conveying your property to anaccomplice, who is always ready to receivehe f.une, and fet off with it. Some Pick-sockets are very dextrous in this way, byntroducing their hands, without being per¬ceived, into the very bottom of the breechessocket, and taking out the money. Nonevas more fo, than the celebrated Mifs Well.Others,in introducing their hsnds upLadies’letticoats, taking hold of the 'pocket, andmak-( 5° 5making an inctfion v-'itli a knife or ferflars.^and letting out the contents into their handswithout difCovery, which they itn,mediateldeliver to their aflbeiates without ftirrinfrom the place, to prevent dete&ion.Pickpockets do not confine themfelveto London, but travel all over the countryto fairs and horfe-races ; and are to be metwith on the (lands, and in the booths, tothe experience of many gentlemen and others,who have lofl purfes, watches, rings, andpocket-books, of which they never receivedany account. Pocket-books are only fecurein the infide pockets, and the coat'buttoned.* Watch-chains fliould be run through a fmallloop, contrived for the purpofe of fecnVingthe watch in the fob, which nrajiy pra&ife.But, at the fa public place?, it is neceflaryfor all perfons to be upon their guard, asthey cannql be ignorant of the gentry theyhave among 11 them, from the many Ioffesiff Rained by them.pII/• f i ■■&iIisMONEY-DROPPERS.I These gentry generally ply at the mofi:isuMic places in town, and alfo at fairs and;ountry markets, confiding of three or more»n company. The dropping of money ishe lure to inveigle countrymen into com¬pany, and is accomplifhed in the followinganner: The Dropper, when conveniencyhits, lays down a guinea, or other piece ofhoney, clofe to any country-man; then, invoice of exultation, exclaims, I have foundi guinea! Upon which a fecond comes up,^nd fays. Where is it? or, I’ll not believe it.re it is, cries the former, and appeals tohe country.man for the truth of his pickingt up; who anfwering in the affirmative,he decond claims a fhare, as they .vere incompany together ; upon which the firfl re*-[torts, If any body has a right to a fhare,t mufl be this honeft country-man, whofaw it on the ground as well as myfelf.—!By this time they are arrived at a houfe ofrefort, and the Dropper propofes givingthem a treat out of it, if they will walk in;intimating, at the fame time, that he intends,to ccnfider the country-man as a party eott-.cerned,earned, who has a right to a lhare thereof.Tnis bait taking, in they go, obferved bythe third, who hitherto had appeared to takeno notice of the others, then call for a roomand fomething to drink. The Dropperthen a/ks the country-man if he has gottenany filver to give in change for the guinea?And according to his anftver they order j;their matters. While they are engaged infharing the money, the third enters, who,fits down, without feeming to know any oneprefent, or their bufinefs. On the Dropper’sfaying he will go out and get change, thefecond replies, It is fcarce worth while forfeven /hillings ; and feeing a pack of cardson the chimnev-piece, propofes cutting ofthem for the fum, which the other accepts;the fecond lofes, and the country-man isalked, if he will rifk his feven /hillings, who,thinking he can be nothing out of pocketif he lofes, accepts the challenge, and winstwo or three times, when a ga ne of V, hidis propofed, and agreed to, if a fourth couldbe found. The pretended llranger fays, ifthey w ill accept of ^ bad player, rather than^ fpoil fport, he will make one. The Drop¬per and country-man agree to be partners;down they fit; the country-man and his/ F3rt*1!1T¥i oartner are fuccefsful; they wager on theidd trick, the beft trump, double and treble: the flakes, till, by fad reverfe of fortune,.he deluded country-man and his artfulpartner are ftripped of the laft farthing.RING - DROPPERS.These are^a fet of cheats, who frequentlyi trick fimple people, both from the countryand in London, out of their money; butimoft commonly exercife their villainous artmpon young women. Their method of pro-feeeding is thus: Privately to drop a ring, .i juft before fuch perfons come up, when theyiiaccoft them as follows-. Young woman, Irhave found a ring, and believe it is gold,"for here is a llamp upon it. Imm diately;.i upon this, an accomplice joins him, who,. being afked the queftion, replies, It is gold," Well, fays the former, as the young-womani faw me pick it up, Ihe has a right to halfij of it. As it often happens that the yourgj perfon has but a few {hillings on her, the! Dropper fays, If you incline the ring, you: lliall have it for what you have got in yourpocket, and what elfe you can give me-.which fonjetimes proves to be a good hand-ker-•kerchief,cloak, or other apparel. The youn^woman being ju(t about to take the rinand give the money and things for it, thaccomplice fays, You had better alk a golfmith if it is gold; but looking about, hperceives the {hops are {hut up, being lateUpon which they conclude it is gold, and!fo part. The deluded creature then {hewsthe ring to a perfon in the ftreet, who informs her fhe is cheated by {harpers, forthe ring is not worth twopence, being onlybrafs gilt, and a falfe Jlamp put on to deceivethe unwary.The above relation is a fa£f, and thefraud was pradlifed by thefe peUilent harpieson a young woman in London.To avoid fuch company in London,much more gaming with them, Grangersought coullantly to be on their guard, and;immediately abfeond when they meet withfuch characters.FINIS, .T.

MTHE GOOD SHIP ROVER.- .KWhen I was a young man,I bore a valiant mind.For to cross the raging sea,it was my whole design ,•I met a jovial ship^mate,who engag'd me to the maia,Then we got our shores on board,and put to sea again.Chor. Aud put to sea again,and put to sea again.Found all relations stranded,and went to sea again.It was in the good Ship Rover,1 sail'd the wo. Id around,Ahd for seven years apd over,I ne’er touch'd British ground ;At length iu old England landed,I left the raging main,Found all relations stranded,.and went to sea again.6That time bOmnd straight to Portugal,right fore and afi we bore ;But when we made Cape Ortugal,a gale blew off the shore :She laj so, it did snock her,a log upon the main,Till, sav’d from Davy’s locker,we put to sea again.Next in a frigate sailing,upon a squally night,Thund'ring. light’ning, hailing,the honors of the sight.My precious limb was lopped off,l, when they eas’d me of my pain,Thank’d God i was not poppedand weal to sea again.Yet still I am enabled,to bring up in life’s rear,Although I’m quite disabled,and Ve in Greenwich tire ;The Cing, God bless his royalty,who took me from the mrin,I’ll praise with love ana loyalty,but ne’er to sea again.Chor. But ne'er to sea again,but ne’er to sea again,I’ll praise with love and loyalty,but ne’er to sea againTHE RECRUIT’S FAREWELL.FarewrU, to you, dear Nancy,likewise my children three)$Behold I'* come to take my leaveof friends and fa«ily;I nave now just enlisted, andmust for a soldier go.Abroad to foreign countries,to face our daring foe.Bear Jack my heart doe* tremble,at this sad news you bring,To say you wou’d leave your family,and go and serve the King,1 will sell my coat, and ratherthan you should go away,And likewise all our furnitureyour smart-money to pay.Bear Nancy I’m now attested,anu imart-money won’t do,I wouia rot rue my bargain,only for parting with you .Bet not my absence grieve you,though l must ciost the main,You’il see me roll in splendour,when I return again.' r r ' . f ‘Bear Jack now do not leave me,and my poor helpless train,But give the sergeant back the coin.and here at home remain,For my mind tells me if you gowhere cannons they do roar.Your loving wife and children,will never see you more.7A Boldier'* fate, tty dear depends,upon the fate of war.An4 I in battle may escapewithout a wound or scar;If I should wear a wooden leg,a pensioner I’ll be.And if 1 gain a chain of gold.I’ll bring it home to thee.Dear Jack, it grieves nay heart to hear,you talk of leg or chain,I wou’d not wish you’d lose one joint,for a pension or for gain;But stay at home and do not roam,to foreign countries.Unless your life you would forfeit *■*amiust yeur enemies.

The fVh h'.liBi and good nHghhouls went wi* John to theI Kirk, where Maggy chanced to meet hirrt,j and was married by the minister.

Jockey sefe-f Ing so many wishing well to his htahh,' bcoupt up what he got for to augment hisq‘health, and gar him live long, which alter-10wards couped him up, and proved detri¬mental to the same.So hame they came to the dinner, wherehis mither presented to them a piping hethaggis, made of the creesh of the black boulhorned ewe, boiled in the meikle pot, mixtwith bear-meal, onions, spice, and mint.This haggis being supt warm, the foamingswats and spice in the liquor set John’s bel¬ly a-bizzing like a working fat; and heplaying het-fk to the fiddler, was suddenlyseized with a hocking and rebounding,which gave his dinner such a backward ca’,that he lost a‘ but the girt bits, which hescythed thro' his teeth.. His mither criedto spence him, and bed Jdm with the brideHis breeks being filed, they washed bothhis hips and laid him in his bed. Pale andjgho^ly was his face, and closed were baithhis ecn. Ah! cries hjs mither, a dismalday indeed ; his bridal and his burial maybe in ae day. Some cuist water in his fjce,and jag'd him wi‘ a needle, till he began torouse himself up, and then lisp out sombroken words. Mither, mither! cries Joc¬key, whar am I now ? Wbar are y ou nowjmy bairn, says his mither, ye’re bedet, anfI'll bring the bride to you. Pedet, saysjJockey, and is my bridal done eke? Ay is'said his mither, and here’s the bride comto lie down beside you, my man, Na, namither, says Jockey, I’ll no lie \vi* an unc11woman indeed, and it binna heads andthraws, the way that I lie wi’ you, mither.O fy, John, says his mither, dinna affrontj yoursel’ and me baith, tak hei in o'er thebed ayont ye, and kiss her, and clap her,and. daut her till ye fa’ asleep. The bridefa's a-crying out, O mither! mither! wasthis the way my fait her guided you thefirst night ? Na, na, thy father was a manof manners, and better mettle ; poor thing,Meg, thou's ca'd thy hogs to a bonny mar¬ket. A bonny market! says Jockey’s mi¬ther ; a shame fa' you and her baith, he'swordy o' her though she were better nor, what she is, or e'er will be.— His friend?1 and her friends being a mixed multitude,some took his part, some took her’s, theredid a battle begin in the clap of a hand,being a very fierce tumult, which ende(1; in blood: they struck so hard with slopes,(sticks, beetles, and barrow trams; pigs,pots, stoups, and trenchers, were flyinglike bombs and granadoes; the crook,bouls, and tangs, were all employed asweapons of war, till down came the bed,with a great mou of peats!

I’m sure you'll go bare,You’ll have nothing father or mother can spare,Of all I possess I’ll deprive you for aye,If o’er the hills, lassie, you go away.It’s father, keep what you are not willing to give,For fain would 1 go with him. as sure as I live;What signifies gold or treasure to me,If the Highland hills is between my love and me.New she is gone with him in spite of them a’,Away to a place that her eyes never saw«He had no steed for to carry her on,But still he said, lassie, think not the road long.In a warm summer’s evening they came to a glen,Being wearied with travel the lassie sat down;4Get up my brave lassie, let us step on,ro, the sun will go round before we get home.My feet are all torn, my shoes are all rent,| m weaned with travel and just like to faint,ere it not for the sake of your kind company,1 would he in the desert until that I die.I he day is far spent and the night’s coming on,And step you aside to yon bonny mill-town,And there you’ll ask lodgings for thee and for me,hor glad would I be in a barn for to be.The place it is pleasant and bonny indeed,But the people are hard-hearled to us that’s in need,Berhaps they’ll not grant us their barn nor byre,But 111 go and ask them as it is your desire.The lassie went foremost, sure I was to blame,lo ask for a lodging myself I thought shame ;ihe lassie replied with tears not a few,It s ill ale, said she, that’s sour when it’s new.In a short time thereafter they came to a grove,Vhere his flocks they were feeding in numberlessdroves,Allan stood musing his flocks for to see,Step on, says the lady, that’s no pleasure to me.A beautful laddie, with green tartan trews,And twa bonnie lassies, were bughting in ewes,1 hey said, honoured master, are you come again.Long, long have we look’d for you coming hame.Bught in your ewes lassies, and go your way homeI ve brought a swan frae the north, I have her totame;Her feathers are fallen, and where can she lie ?The best bed in the house her bed shall be.The lady's heart was far down it coudna well rise ;I ill many a lad and lass came in with a phrase,To welcome the lady to welcome her home ;Such a hall in the Highlands she never thought on.The laddies did whistle and the lassies did sing,1 hey made her a supper might served a queen ;With ale and with whisky they drank her healthround;And they made to the lady a braw bed of down.** *Early next morning he led her to the hay,He bid her look round as far as she could spy,These lands and pc ssessions my debt for to pay,You winna gae round them in a lang summer day.O Allan ! O Allan ! I’m indebted to thee,It is a debt, dear Allan, I never can pay.O Allan! 0 Allan ! how came you for me !Sure I am not worthy your bride for to be.How call you me Allan, when Sandy’s my name?v\ hy call you me Allan ? sure you are to blame :6For don’t you remember when at school with thee,I was hated by all the rest but love<i by thee ?How oft have I fed on your bread & your cheese PLikewise when you had but an handful of pease,Your cruel hearted father hound at me his dogs,They tore my bare heels, and rave all my rags.Is this my dear Sandy whom I lov’d so dear?I have not heard of you this many a year ;When all the rest went to bed, sleep was frae me,For thinking on what was become of thee.My parents were born lane before me.Perhaps bv this time they ate drown’d in the sea.These lands and possessions they left them to me.And I came for you, jewel, to share them withthee.In love we begun and in love we wi ll end.And in joy and mirth our days we will spend:And a voyage to your father once more we will go,And relieve the oid farmer from Ids trouble andwoe.With men and maid servants us to wait upon,So away to her father in a chaise they are gone;The laddie went foremost, the brave Highland loun,Till tney came to the road that leads to the town.When he came to the gate, he gave a loud roar,Come down, gentle farmer, Catherine’s at yourdoor,7When he look’d out at the window, he saw hisdaughter’s face,With his hat in his hand lie made a great phrase.Keep on your hat, farmer, don’t let it fa',For it sets not the peacock to bow to the crow.It’s hold your tongue, Sawney, and do not tauntme,For my daughter’s not worthy your bride for to be.Now he held his bridle reins, till he came down,And then he conveyed him to a fine room ;With the finest of spirits they drank a fi ie toast,And the son and the father drank both in one glass.The Crook and Plaid.If lassies loe the laddies, they surely should confess,For evety lassie has a lad she loes aboon the rest;He’s dearer to her bosom whatever be his trade,And thiough life !’ll loe the laddie that wears theCrook and Plaid.He’s aye true to his lover, aye true to me.He climbs the mountains early, his fleecy flocks toview,He spier the little laverocks spring out frae ’mangthe dew;His faithful little dogie, so frolicsome and glad,Wanders forward with the laddie that wears theCrook and Plaid. For he’s, &c.8He pues the blooming heather, he pues the lillymeek,Calls the lily like my bosom the heather like mycheek,His words are aye so tender, my heart is aye soglad,There’s nae wooer like the laddie that wears theCrook and Plaid. For he’s, &c.I winna hae the laddie that ca’s the cart & plough,Although he may be tender, although be may betrue,But I will hae the laddie, that has my heart betrayedHe’s the faithful shepherd laddie, that wears theCrook and Plaid. For he’s &c.It’s down beside the hawthorn that blooms in thevale,I’ll meet him in the gleaming far frae the noisy gale,His words are aye sue tender, my heart is aye saeglad,For he kens the way sae nicely to row me in hisPlaid. For he’s, &c.To such a faithful lover, oh, who would not comply,True love gives purer pleasure than aught beneaththe sky,If love be in your bosom, my he?rt can ne’er besad,And thro’ life I’ll lo’e the laddie that wears theCrook and Plaid.

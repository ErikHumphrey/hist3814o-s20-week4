are ye mad ?Thrummy then turn’d him round about.An’ lent John in the ribs a clout,Till on the beef he tumbled down.In little better than a swoon ;While Thrummy, fast as he could rin,Gaed aff to see what made the din :The chamber seemed to him as lightAs if the sun was shinning bright;The ghaist was standing near the door.In the same dress it had before,An’ o’er anent it, at the wa’,Were ither apparitions twa—14These spirits seemed to kick a ba’,The ghaist against the ither twa;Whilk close they drove, baith back an’ fore,Atween the chimla an’ the door.Thrummy awhile beheld the play ;Syne running up, he thus did say :“ Ane for ane may weel compare,“ But twa for ane is rather sair ;“ The play’s nae equal, sae I vow,“ Dear brither Thrummy, I’ll help you.’’Syne wi’ his foot he kick'd the ba’.Card her play slot against the wa’ ;Quick then, as light’ning frae the sky.The spectres gae a horrid cry,An’ vanish’d wi’ a clap o’ thunner,While Thrummy at the same did wonner.The room was quiet now an’ mirk.An’ Thrummy stilping in his sark ;damping the gate back till his bed,He thinks he hears a person tread.An’ ere he gat within the door.The ghaist again stood him before;Straight up afore him it did standWi’ a large candle in its hand.Quo’ Thrummy, friend, I want to knowWhat brings you frae the shades below,I, in my maker’s name, command.Ye’ll tell your story just aff hand.What wad ye hae? I’ll do my bestFor you, to let you be at restThen says the ghaist, ’tis forty yearSin I’ve been doom’d to wander here ;In a’ that time, there has been noneBehav’d sae bold as you ha’e done ;Sae if ye’ll do a job for me,Disturbance mair I’ll never gi’e.Say on your tale, quo’ Thrummy, ITo gi’e you justice, sure will try.Then mark me weel, the ghaist reply’d.An’ you shall soon be satisfic’d.Frae this aback, near fifty year^I o’ this place was overseer.Whan this laird’s father had the land,A’ thing was then at my command,Wi> power to do as I thought fit.In ilka cause I chief did sit;The laird paid great respect to me,But I an ill return did gie ;The title deeds o’ his estate,Out o’ the same I did him cheat;I staw them frae where they did lye.Some days afore the laird did die—His son at that time was in France,An* sae I thought I’d hae some chance,Gif he should never come again.That the estate would be my ain.But scarcely three bare weeks were past.When death did come an’ grip me fast,Sae sudden that I had nae powerThe charter back for to restore.Soon after that hame cam the heir,An’ syne gat up the refu’ rair,What sorrow was come o’ the rights.He sought them several days and nights ;But never yet ha’e they been seen.As I aneath a muckle staneDid hide them i’ this chamber wa’,Weel sew’d up in a leather ba’,But I was ne’er allow’d to rest,Until that I the same confest;But this to do, I had nae powerFrae yon time to this vera hour;17But I’ve reveal’d it a’ to you.An’ now I’ll tell you what to do,Till nae langsyne, nae mony kentThat this same laird the rights did want;But now they hae him at the law,An’ the neist ouk the laird maun shaw.Afore the court the rights o’s land—This pits him till an unco stand ;b.Ti'OTusnj ftB J7*I ant riguoinl nwoVJFor gif he disna shaw them there,O’ a’ his lands he’ll be stript bare ;Nae hope has he to save’s estate ;This maks him sour and unco blate,/jfj<r,ffs'*}, iMlJi 91 C'liJ Siri OHe canna think whare’s rights may beAn’ ne’er expects them mair to see.But now, my friend, mark what I tell,An’ ye’ll get something to yoursel’:Tak out that stane there i’ the wa.An’ then you’ll get the leather ba’.Its just the same that you did see,When you said that ye wad help me—The rights are sew’d up in its heart,But see ye dinna wi’ them part,Until the laird sail pay you downJust fifty guineas an’ a crown.18Whilk at my death was due to me ;This for thy trouble I’ll gie thee.An’ I’ll disturb this house nae mair,Cause I’ll be free frae a’ my care.This Thrummy promised to do,An’ syne the ghaist bade him adieu,An’ vanish’t \vi’ a pleasant soundDown through the laft an’ through the ground.Thrummy gaed back syne till his bed,An’ cowardly John was very glad.That he his neighbour saw ance mair,For o’ his life he did despair.Wow man ! quo’ he, where ha’e you been?Come tell me a’ fat ye hae seen ?Na, bide, says Thrummy, till day-light.I’ll tell you syne baith clear an’ right.Sae down they lay an’ took a nap.Until the ninth hour it did chap..-i «Whan John was sleeping, Thrummy raise,An’ to the chamber aff he gaes,Taks out the stane out o’ the wa’,An’ soon he fand the leather ba’,Took out the rights, replac’d the stane,Ere John kend weel whare he had been ;19iSyne baith cam stepping down the stair,The morning now was calm an’ fair.Weel, says the laird, my trusty frien’.Ha’e ye ought i’ your chamber seen ?Quo’ Thrummy, Sir, I naething saw.That did me ony ill ava.Ye ken the day’s nae very lang,I’ the mean time ’tis calm an clear.Ye lose your time in biding here.Quo’ Thrummy, Sir, mark what I tell,I’ve mair right here than you yoursell,Sae till I like, I here shall bide.• .The Laird at this began to chide ;Says he, my friend, ye’re turnin’ rude ;Quo’ Thrummy, I’ll my claim mak’ guid ,For I, just here afore you a’.The rights o’ this estate can shaw.An’ that is mair than ye can do.What ! quo the laird, can that be true ?’Tis true, quo’ Thrummy look an’ see.D’ye think that I wad tell a lie ?The papers frae his pouch then drew.An’ down upo’ the table threw.20The laird at this up to him ran,An’ cry’d, whare did you get them, man ?Syne Thrummy tald him a’ the tale,As I’ve tald you baith clear an’ hale ;The laird at this was hdgin’ fain,That he wad get his rights again.An’ fifty guineas down did tell.Besides a present frae himsell.Thrummy him thank’t an’ then the gowdIntil a muckle purse he stow’d.An’ crammed it in his oxter pouch,An’ syne sought out his aiken crutch ;Says, fare ye weel, I maun awa,An’ see gin I get thro’ the sna’.Weel fare ye weel, replied the laird,But how comes it ye hinna shar’dOr gi’en your neighbour o’ the money ?Na ! by my saul I, Sir, quo’ Thrummy,Whan I this siller sair did win,To baud in this wad be a sin.Afore that I the ghaist had laid,The nasty beast had s—t the bed.An’ sae my tale I here do end,I hope no one it will offend ;21j My Muse will nae assist me langer,I The dorty jad sometimes does anger ;I thought her ance a gay smart lass ;!

He has likewise been known todon a beloved haunt, when often surprised in his places of daily:ment, or when any particular observations were made on hisarance, which was “ meagre, shaggy, and wild.” It is there,very probable, as we have no later tradition concerning thepnie of the following ballad, that the questions put to him byiage femme at the door of the farm house, occasioned his de-ire from his favourite Fearnden for ever.There liv’d a man on Noranside,When Jamie held his ain ;He had a mailen fair an’ wide,* An’ servants nine or ten.22He had a servant dwellin’ near.Worth a’ his maids and men—This was the Brownie ye maun trow,Wha won’d in Fearnden.When there was cny corn to thrash.Or ony byres to clean.He never mindit mickle fash.Or toilin’ on his lane. *An’ tho’ the snaw was ne’er sae deepHe skippit thro’ the glen.An’ ran an errand in a wheep,The Brownie o’ Fearnden.Ae night the guidwife o’ the houseFell sick, an’ like to dee ;An’ for a cannie mammie-wife,She wantit them to gae.The night was dark and ne’er a sparkWad venture through the glen.For fear he should wi’ Brownie meet.In drearie Fearnden.But Brorvnie stood behind the door,An’ heard of a’ the strife ;He saw tho’ there was fouth o’ men,They sune wad tine the wife.23He aff an’ mounts the fleetest mare’An’ thro’ the wind and rain;And soon he wan the mammie-wife’s,Wha won’d ayont the den.He chappit loudlie at the door.Crying, “ Mak ye haste an’ rise.Put on your claise, an’ come wp me.An’ tak ye nae surprise.Put on your ridin’ hude o’ grey.To hap you f'rae the rain ;’f11 O whaur am I gaun,” quo’ the wife;“ O whar but thro’ the den.”Whan baith were mountit on the mare.An passin’ thro’ the glen—“ O wat ye laddie,” said the wife,“ Gin he be near the den !Are we come near the den,” she said ;“ Tush, wisht you feul!” quo’ he.For waur na ye hae i’ your armsThis night ye winna see.”They sune waur landit at the door,The wife he handit down—“ I’ve left the house but ae hauf hour,I am a clever loun”—•24“ What makes your feet sae braid ?” quo’ she“ What makes your een sae wan ?”“ I’ve wander’d monie a wearie foot,An’ drearie sights I’ve seen !”.,1But mind the wife an’ mind the wean.An’ see that a’ gae right;An' I wil take yon hame agen.Afore the mornin’ light.An’ gin they spier wha brought you here,’Cause they were scant o’ men.E’en tell them that ye rade ahintThe Brownie o’ Fearnden !”jtt..-:! adt n > JiJnnam sijw d,‘ .

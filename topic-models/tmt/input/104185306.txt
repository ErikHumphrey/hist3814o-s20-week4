Every body knows that the ladies itSpain in certain cafes do not give long warningpradfitioners of a certain defcription, and no body knew it better than Nicolas, who was refo!ve«not to lofe an inch of his way, ncr of his mule’heft fpeed by the way, if cudgelling could beat, icut of her. It was plain to Nicolas’s convkftioias plain could be, that his road laid Ptraight forwarcto the little convent in front; the mule was of opinion, that the turning on the left down the hiltowards the Prado was the road of all roads moffamiliar and agreeable to herfelf, and accordinglybegan to uifpute the point of topography with Nicolas, by living her fore feet refolutely in th«ground, dipping her head at the fame time bentween them, and launching heels and crupper furioufly into the air, in the way of argument. Lit¬tle Pedrofu, who was armed ?t heel with one maffy filver fpur of ftout, though ancient workmanfit ip, refolutely applied the ruftv rowel to theIhoulden.'iil in the world to the very butt, and at the fameime adroitly tucking his blue cloth capa under hi*light arm, and flinging the fldrt over the left (houi-ler €7i cavalier, began to lay about him with a ftoutilhen fapling upon the ears, p?>le, and cheeks ofne recreant mule. The fire now flafhed from aiair of Andalufian eyes, as black as charcoal andjot lefs inflammable, and taking the fegara from hiattouth, with which he had vainly hoped to have re-aled his noflrils in a fharp winter’s evening by die;-ay, raifed fuch a thundering troop of angels*aims, and martyrs, from St. Michael downwards,mt forgetting his own namefake Saint Nicolas deTolentino by the way, that if curfes could havemade the mule to go, the difpute would have beenipon ended, but not a faint could make her ftir a-|y other ways than upwards and downwards at aand. A fmall troop of mendicant friars were at43 moment conducing the hoft to a dying man.Nicolas Pedrofa,” fays an old friar, “ be pa¬tient with your beaft, and fpare your blafphe-mies; remember Balaam.”—“ Ah, father,” re¬lied Pedrofa, “ Balaam cudgelled his beaft till fhefpoke, fo will I mine till the roars,”—Fie, fie,profane fellow,” cries another of the fraternity..Go about your wotk, friend,” quoth Nicolas,and let me go about mine ; I warrant it is themore prefling of the two; your patient is goingout of the world, mine is coming into it.”I_ Hear him,” cries a third, “ hear the vile wretch,how he blafphemes the body of God.”'—Andi ten the troop palled flowlv on Jo the tinkling of| re bell.A man muft know nothing of a mule’s fears*i dio does not know what a pafiion they have forhe tinkling cf a bell, and no fooner had the jing-Iin£ chords vibrated in the fvnipathetic organsPedrofa’s beaft, than boulting forward with a fuden fpring, fhe ran roaring into the throng of fiars, trampling on fome, and ihouldering others Ja moft profane rate; when Nicolas availing hifelt of the impetus, and perhaps not able to cotroul it, broke away, and was out of fight in a mir.ent. {i / 11 the devils in hell blow fire into tiltail, thou bead of Babylon,” muttered Nicolashimfelf as he fcampered along, never once lookiibehind him, or flopping to apologize for the michief he had done to the bare feet and fhirtlefs ritof the holy brotherhood.Whether Nicolas faved his diftance, as likewifiif he did, whether it was a male or female Gaftlian he ufliered into the world, we {hall not ju.now enquire, contented to await his return in :hfirft of the morning next day, when he had tifooner difmcunted at his fliop and delivered himule to a fturdy Arragonefe wench, when DyIgnacio de Santos Aparicio, rdguazi! mayor of tl>fupremc and general inquifition, put an order into his hand, figned and fealed by the inquifidcgeneral, for the conveyance of his body to the C;fa, whofe formidable door prefents itfeif in thflreet adjoining to the fquare, in which Nicplasbrafen bafin hung forth the emblem of his tradeThe poor little fellow, trembling in every joinand,with a face as yellow as faftron, dropt a kneto the altar, which fronts the' entrance, and crojfed himfelf molt devoutly ; as foon as he hadcended the find flight of flairs, a porter habited iiblack opened the tremendous barricade, and Ncolas with horror heard the grating of the heav.holts that (hut him in. He was led through pafages and vaults and melancholy cells, till he w;delivered into the dungeon, where he was final!le:9left to his folitary meditations.

The ar¬dour of a chace now fet all hands to work, and afew hours brought them near enough to difeenv'that fne was a Spanilh frigate, and feemingly froma long voyage. Little Pedrofa, as alert as the reft|ftript hintfelf for his work, and repaired to his pollin the cock-pit, whilft the thunder of the guns rol¬led incefTaiulv overhead: three chears from thewhole crew at length announced the moment ofvictory, and a few more minutes afeertained thegood news that the prize was a frigate richly laderUfrom the Sbuth Seas with the Governor of Quitoand his fuiteon board.Pedrofa was now called upon deck, and fent onboard the prize, as interpreter to the lirft lieutejnant, who was to take poffeffion of iter. He foundevery thing in confufion, a deck covered with theHaiti, and the whole crew in ccnilernation at. anevent they were in no degree prepared for, not.having received any intimation of a war. He loun<|the officers in general, and the pafiengers without,exception, under the moil horrid impreffions of the;Englilhaglifli, and expecting to be plundered, and per-ips butchered, without mercy. Don Manuei deina&fonda, the Governor, whofe countenance be¬spoke a conftitution far gone in a decline, hadb.rown Idmfelf on a fbpha in the lad date of def-*lir, and given way to an edulion of tears; whenlieutenant entered the cabin, he rote tremblingom his couch, and with the mod funplicating ae-n prefented to him his fword, and with it a cafk-, which he carried in his other hand. As he ten-red thefe fpoils to his conqueror, whether thro’eaknefs* or of Ids own will, he made a mot! mbending his knee: the geaerpus Briton fhockedthe unmanly overture, caught him fuddenly withrh hands, and turning to Pedrofa, laid aloud,“ Convince this gentleman he has fallen intoe hands of an honourable enemy.” “ Is itdTible !” cried Don Manuel and lifting up histhe countenance of the Britilhicer,ig eyes to the countenancefaw humanity, valour, and generous pity,drongly charactered in his youthful features,at the conviction was irrefiftable. “ Will he notcept my fword ?” eried the Spaniard. He de¬es you to wear it, till he has the honour of pre-iting you to his captain.” “Ah! then hes a captain,” exclaimed Manuel; “ his fuperiorbe of another way of thinking ; tell him, thisfleet contains my jewels ; they are valuable ; leti prefeat them as a lawful prize, which will en-:h the captor; his fuperior will not hefitate tore them, from me ”—“ If they are your Excel-ds private property,” replied Pedrofa, “ lamdered to adore you, that if your flop was load-with jewels, no Britiih officer in the fervicc ofking will take them at your hands ; the {hip1 effects of his Catholic Majeft - are the oilyze 6f the captors; the perfonals of the paffen-ger*!'l 1 ! ! 1, J1 1 ^ 1 J k Jgers are. invioiate.” << Generous nation ex¬claimed Don Manuel, “ how greatly have I wrong¬ed thee!” -The boats'of the Britilh frigate now'came along-fide, atui part of the crew were fhift-ed out of the prize, taking their trunks and clothesalong with them, in which they were very cordi¬ally affilted by their conquerors. The barge foonafter came a-boanl, with an officer in the (lern-fheets, and the crew in their white fhir's and velvetcaps, to efcort the governor and the ihip’s captainon board the frigate, which lay with her fails tothe rnaft awaiting their arrival: the accommoda¬tion ladder was flung over the fide, and mannedfor the prifoners, who were received on the gang¬way by the fecond lieutenant, whillt perfect filence,and the ftriCfefl difeipline reigned in the Ihip,where all were under the decks, and no inquifitivecurious eyes were fuffered to wound the feelingsof the conquered, even with a glance. In the doorof his cabin flood the captain, who received themwith that modeft complaifance, which does not re¬volt the unfortunate by an overftrained politenefs;he was a man of high birth and elegant manners,with a heart as benevolent as it was brave : Suchan addrefs, fet off with a perfon finely formed,and perfectly engaging, could not fail to imprefsthe prifoners with the molt favourable ideas, andas Don Manuel fpoke French fluently, he couldconverfe with the Britilh captain without the helpof an interpreter. As he exprefled an impatientdefire of being admitted to his parole, that hemight revifit friends and connections, from whichhe had been long feparated, he was overjoyed tohear that the Englifh (hip would carry her prizeinto Lkhon ; and that he would there he fet on.fhore, and permitted to make the belt of his wayfrom thence to Madrid. He talked of his wife!withIJ11, U k U ^ith all the ardour of the moft impr.lTioned lcver>nd apologized for his tears by imputing them toipe agony of his mind apd the infirmity of hiseaith, under the dread of being longer feparaiedi<rom an object fo dear to his heart, and on whome doated with the fondeft affection. The gener-'us captor indulged him in thefe converfaticns,Sind, being a hufband himfdf, knew how to allowr all the fendernefs of his fen fat ions. “ A!;,1 ir,” cried Don Manuel, “ would to heaven itivere iy my power to have the honour of prefent-tg my beloved Leonora to you on our landing atifbon—Perhaps,” added he, turning to Pedrofa,|)'ho at that moment entered the cabin, “ this gen-etnan, whom I take to be a Spaniard, may haveard the name of Donna Leonora de CafaTonda :he has been at Madrid, it is poflible he may haveen her ; fhould that be the cafe, he can teflifyher external charms ■, I alone can witnefs to thequifite perfection of her mind.”  “ Senoren Manuel,” replied Pedrofa, “ 1 have feen Don-Leonora, and your Excellency is warranted in1 you can fay in her praife ; fire is of incompar-le beapty.” Thefe words threw the uxoriousaniard into raptures ; his eyes fparkled with de¬bt ; the blood rufhed into his imaciated cheeks,d every feature glowed with unutterable joy ; heeffed Pedrofa with a variety of rapid enquiries,1 which he evaded by pleading ignorance, faying,at he had only had a cafual glance of her as thefled along the Prado. The embarraflment, bow¬er, which accompanied thefe anfwers did not e-pe live Englifh Captain, who fhertly after, draw-; Pedrofa afide into the furgeon’s cabin, was byin n ade acquainted with the mdandioly fitua-n of that unfortunate lady, and every partku-' cf tl.e flory as btfoye related j nay, the veryvialin is—x II h li 1 ^ !

The painful moment was now come, whenh explanation of feme fort became unavoidable,[he generous Engiifhinan, with a countenance ex-Veflive of the tendered pity, took the Spaniard’sf.nd in his, and feating him on a couch befidefm, ordered the Centincl to keep the cabin pri-fte, and delivered himfelf as follows.-“ Senor don Manuel, I mud now impart to youIan anxiety which I laboured under on your ac¬count—I have drong reafons to fiifpect you haveenemies in your ow n country, who are upon thewatch to aired you on your landing; when Ihave tph! yon this, I ex peel you will repofe fuchtrud in my honour and the finccrity of my re-fit'd lor you, as not to demand a further expla-. “ nation'?“ nation of the particulars on which my intelli“ gence is founded.” “ Heaven and £:;rth !” criethe aftoniihed Spaniard, “ who can be thofe ene,c mies I have to fear, and what can I liave don '-c‘ So far I will open myfel ,“ to deferve them“ to you,” anfwered the captain, as to point on ;“ the principal to you, the inquifidor general.”-The bell friend I have in Spain,” exclaimed thi ’governor; “ my fworn protector, the patron of m’“ fortune: He my enemy ! impoflabltWei^ Sir,” replied the captain, “ if my advice doe;l“ not meet belief, I mult fo far exert my author!'“ ty for your fake, as to make this fliip your pri“ fon, till I have waited 0:1 our minifttr at Lilboi“ and made the inquiries neceffarv for vour fafetv“ fufpend your judgment upon the feeming hanhjj“ nefs of this meafure till I return to you again dland at the fame time riling from his feat, he gayorders for the barge, and leaving drift injunction■with the fird lieutenant not ro allow of the governnoTs quitting the frigate, he put off for the Ihorejand left the melancholy Spaniard buried in pro?found and fiient meditation.The emiffaries of the inquifition having at lafljtraced Pedrofa to Lilbon, and-there gained intel¬ligence of his having entered on board the frigateour captain had no fooner turned into the porchof the hotel at Buenos-Ay res,»than he was accoft|ed by a meffenger of date with a requifition irotiithe prime minider’s office for the furrender of cneNicolas Pedrofa, a fubjeCl of Spain, and a criniynal, who had efcaped out of the prifon of the Inquifition in Madrid, where he doed charged oilhigh crimes and mifdcameanors.—As foon as thiajrequifition was explained to our worthy captain,without condcfcenuing to a word in repiy he cal¬led for pen and ink, and writing a fhort order to.theie officer commanding on board, inflantly dif-atched the midfliipman, who attended him, tole barge with directions to make the beft of hisray back to the frigate and deliver it to the lieu-;nant: Then turning to the meflenger, he faid toLm in a refolute tone—“ That Spaniard is nowI borne on my books, and before you fhall takeI him out of the fervice of my King, you mudS fink his ffiip.”—Not waiting for a reply he im¬mediately proceeded, without ftop, to the houfeI f the Britii'h Minifter at the further end of thelity: Here he found Pedrofa’s intelligence, withttgard to the Governor of Quito, exprefidy veri-. ed, for the order had come down even to Lilbon,pon the chance of the Spaniih frigate’s takinglielter in that port. To this Minifter he relatedle horrid tale, which Pedrofa had delivered toim, and with h:s concurrence it was determinedforward letters into Spain, which Don Manueliiould be advifed to write to his lady and friends: Madrid and to wait their anfwer before any fur-iier difcoveries were imparted to him refpedlingic blacker circumftances of the cafe: in the mean|me, it was refolved to keep the prifoner fafe ins afylum.The generous captain loft no time in returninghis frigate, where he immediately imparted toon Manuel the intelligence he had obtained ate Britifh Minifter’s—“ Phis indeed,” cried theicted Spaniard, “ is a ftroke 1 was in no refpecftprepared for; I had fondly perfuaded myfelfthere was not in the whole empire of Spain amore friendly heart than that of the Inquifidor’s;to my beloved Leonora lie had ever {hewn thetcnderueff. of a paternal afFeCUon from her verychildhood ; liy turn our hands were joined ; hislips pronounced the nuptial benediction, and“throughirougJi his tavour l was promotef^(^Tiy gc-“ vernment: Grant, Heaven, no misfortune hath** befallen my Leonora ! furely fhe cannot have of*™“ fended him and forfeited his favour” “ As £iknow him not,” replied the captain, “I carV'“ form no judgment of his motives, but this I ;“ know, that if a man’s heart is capable of cruel- ,“ ty, the fitteft fchool to learn it in, muft be tha“ Inquifition.” The propofal was now fuggefteiliof fending letters into Spain, and the Governor!retired to his deik for the purpofe of writing them 5 .in the afternoon of the fame day the Minifter paid ca vifit to the Captain, and receiving a packer fronn lrthe hands of Don Manuel, promifed to get it for*iwarded by a fafe conveyance according to direcfionvIn due courfe of time this fatal letter from Leo-*nora opened ah the horrible tranfatflion to thejwretched hufband :—“ The guilty hand of an expiring wife, underj“ the agonizing operation of a mortal poifon, tra-“ ces thefe few trembling lines to an injured“ wretched hufband.

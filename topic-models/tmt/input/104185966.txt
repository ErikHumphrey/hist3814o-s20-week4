/THEBATTLE OPPHILIPHAUQH;TOGETHER WITH THEBATTLE OF LOEMIMILL,ANDAUCHINDOWN,GLASGOW:PRINTED FOR THE BOOKSELLERS.80.THE BATTLE OF PHILIPHAUGH.On Philiphaugh a fraj began,At Hairhead wood it ended ;The Scots out o’er the Grsemes they ran,Sae merrily they bended.Sir David frae the border came,Wi’ heart an’ hand came he ;Wi’ him three thousand bonnie Scots,To bear him company.Wi’ him three thousand valiant men,A noble sight to see !A cloud o’ mist them weel concealed,As close as e’er might be.When they came to the Shaw burn,Said he, “ Sae weel we frame,I think it is convenient,That we should sing a psalm.”#When they came to the Lingly burn.As day-light did appear.They spy’d an aged father.And lie did draw t em near.3“ Come hither, aged father! ”Sir David he did cry,“ And tell me where Montrose lies,With all his great army.“ But, first, you must come tell to me.If friends or foes you be ;I fear you are Montrose’s men.Come frae the north country.”“No, we are nane o’ Montrose’s men,Nor e’er intend to be ;I am Sir David Lesly,That’s speaking unto thee.”“ If you’re Sir David Lesly,As I think weel ye be,I’m sorry ye ha’e brought so fewInto your company.“ There’s fifteen thousand armed men,Encamped on yon lee ;Ye’ll never be a bite to them.For aught that I can see.“ But, halve your men in equal parts,Your purpose to fulfil;Let ae half keep the water side.The rest gae round the hill.“ Your nether party fire must,Then beat a flying drum ;And then they’ll think the day’s their ain,And frae the trench they’ll come.4“ Then, those that are behind them maunGi’e shot, baith grit and sma’;And so, between jour armies twa,Ye may make them to fa’.”“ 0 were ye ever a soldier?”Sir David Lesly said ;“ 0 yes; I was at Solway flow,Where we were all betray’d.“ Again I was curst at Dunbar,And was a pris’ner ta’en:And many a weary night and day.In prison I ha’e lien.”“ If ye will lead these men aright.Rewarded shall ye be ;But, if that ye a traitor prove,I’ll hang thee on a tree.”“ Sir, I will not a traitor prove ;Montrose has plundered me ;I’ll do my best to banish himAway frae this country.”He halv’d his men in equal parts,His purpose to fulfil;The one part kept the water side.The other gaed round the hill.The nether party fired brisk,. Then turn’d and seem’d to rin ;And then they a’ came frae the trench.And cry’d, “ The day’s our ain!”5The rest then ran into the trench.And loos’d their cannons a’;And thus, betweeen his armies twa,He made them fast to fa’.Now, let us a* for Leslj pray.And his brave company!For they ha’e vanquish’d great Montrose,Our cruel enemy.THE BATTLE OF LOUDON-HILL.You’l marvel when I tell ye o’Our noble Burly, and his train ;When last he march’d up thro’ the land,Wi’ sax-and-twenty westland men.IThan they I ne’er o’ braver heard.For they had a’ baith wit and skill;They proved right well, as I heard tell.As they cam’ up o’er Loudon-hill.Weel prosper a’ the gospel lads.That are into the west countrie ;Ay wicked Claver’se to demean,And ay an ill dead may he die!For he’s drawn up i’battle rank.An’ that baith soon and hastilie ;But they wha live till simmer come,Some bludie days for this will see.6But up spak’ cruel Claver’se then,Wi’ hastie wit, an’ wicked skill;“ Gi’e fire on yon westlan’ men ;I think it is my sov’reign’s will.’*But up bespake his cornet, then,“ It’s be wi’ nae consent o’ me!I ken I’ll ne’er come back again,An’ mony mae as weel as me.“ There is not ane of a’ yon men,But wha is worthy other three ;There is na ane amang them a’,That in his cause will stap to die.“ An’ as for Burly, him I knaw ;He’s a man of honour, birth, an’ fameGi’e him a sword into his hand,He’ll fight thysel’ an’ other ten."But up spake wicked Claver’se then,I wat his heart it raise fu’ hie!And he has cry’d that a’ might hear,“ Man, ye ha’e sair deceived me.“ I never ken’d the like afore,Na, never since I came frae hame,That you sae cowardly here suld prove,An’ yet come of a noble Graeme.”But up bespake his cornet, then,“ Since that it is your honour’s will,Mysel’ shall be the foremost man,That shall gi’e fire on Loudon-hill.I*“At your command I’ll lead them on,But yet wi’ nae consent o’ me ;For weel I ken I’ll ne’er return,And mony mae as weel as me.”Then up he drew in battle rank;I wat he had a bonnie train!But the first time that bullets flew.Ay he lost twenty o’ his men.Then back he came the way he gaed,I wat right soon and suddenly !He gave command amang his men.And sent them back, and bade them flee.Then up came Burly, bauld an’ stout,Wi’s little train o’ Westland men ;Wha mair than either aince or twiceIn Edinburgh confined had been.They ha’e been up to Lnndon sent,An’ yet they’re a’ come safely down ;Sax troop o’ horseme* they ha’e beat,And chased them into (jlasgow town.AUCH INDOWN.At Auchindown, the tenth of June,Sae merry, blythe, and gay. Sir,Each lad and lass did till a glass.And drink a health that day. Sir8We drank a health, and nae by stealth,’Mang kimmers bright and lordly :“ King James the Eighth! for him we’ll fight,And down wi’ cuckold Geordie!”We took a spring, and danc’d a fling.And wow but we were vogie!We didna fear, though we lay nearThe Campbells, in Stra’bogie ;Nor yet the loons, the black dragoons,At Fochabers a-raising:If they durst come, we’d pack them home.And send them to their grazing.We fear’d no harm, and no alarm.No word was spoke of dangers;We join’d the dance, and kiss’d the lance,And swore us foes to strangers.To ilka name that dar’d disclaimOur Jamie and his Charlie.“ King James the Eighth! for him we’ll fight.And down the cuckold carlie! ”

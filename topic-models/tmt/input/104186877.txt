l THE BAD WIFI0 /Bannocks d Bailey,THE MAID OF LODI,GEORGE REILY,ANDNo cheering Sun-beams, ^e.-THE BAD WIFE.v v% %O, Jamie, lad, hear my advice.And warning tak’ by me, man,For if ye get a wife like me.You’ll ru’t until ye die, man.For when that I was in my youth,Idke you I then could quench my drought,But now I dare na weet my mouth,For Maggy’s tongue,—deil drive her south,To some place far ;.wa’, man.On Sunday, if I speir for .She swears I’m seeking drink, man; *Then o’er my head, with furious rage.The tangs aloud will clink man.This is the life that I must bear.She’ll oft haurl ©ut my very hair.And then she’ll rage, and curse, and swekrAnd cry ye dog, I’ll gi’e ye mair,1 ho' for you I should die, man.And, Jamie, when I got her first,I thought myself enrich’d man,Her beauty and her bonny claesThey had me saebewitch d man;I had na power to see her ill,She led me captive at her will,Poor simple youth, I had nae skill,But thought that she was like inysel'.For love and unity, man.But when the fatal knot was tiedI found I was betray’d, man,For she was fill’d wi' nought hut strife,And foolish empty pride, man;I sit as mute as ony sot,Wi’ no a word out o’ my throat,Till o’er my head the chamber potIn twenty pieces it is broke,And then I’m forc’d to flee, manAnd if her wants I can't supply,She’ll fles»fike fire on me, man;And let the pinclt be ne-’er so great,She cries aloud for tea, man:And if I bid her gang to work,She flies at me just like a Turk,Wi’ venom she could cut my throat.Or shoot me dead upon the spot,She’s fill'd wi’ cruelty man.Sut, Jamie, when ye wale a wile,Lay beauty a’ aside, man,The pleasures o' a virtuous wifeAre beyond a bonny bride, man.Think on their wild deceitfu’ ways,Their painted cheeks and bonny claes.They’re like a stocking fu' o’ fiaes,That will torment ye a’ your days,Until the day ye die, man.BANNOCKS o’ BARLEY.Bannocks o’ bear-meal, bannocks o’ b'arley*Here’s to the-Highlandman’s bannocks of bley.Wha in a brulzie

were.never cloudy,Nor e’er distort with glee.She values not the wealthy.Unless they're great and good,For she is strong, and healti-y,And by labour earns her food. »And when her day’s work’s over;Around n cheerful fire,She sings, or rests contented;What more can man desire?.Let those' who squander millionsReview her happy lot,They’ll find their proud pavillionsFar inferior to her cot.Between the Po and ParmaSome villains seiz’d my coach,And dragg’d me to a cavern,Most dreadful to approach;By whidr the maid of LodiCame trotting from the fair;She paus'd to hear my waitings.And see me tear my hair.Then to her market basketShe tied herponey’s reipjI thus by female courageWas dragg’d to life again.Then sing the maid of Lodi,Who sv’eetly sung to me;And when this maid is married,Still happier may she be.AN EXCELLENT NEW SONG,calledGEORGE REILY.It was on a summer’s morning, the weather being faiI stroll’d for recreation clown by a river clear,I overheard a damsel most

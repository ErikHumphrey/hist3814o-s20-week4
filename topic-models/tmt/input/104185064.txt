Where do you dwell,I have nought wall go with thee;I fear it is some lower cell,I pray thee therefore fet me be.This is a stormy night and cold,I I'll bring you to a warmer inn ;Will you go forward and be bold,And mend your pace till ye win in.I fear your inn will be too warm,For too much hotness is not best;Such hotness there may do me harrti,And keep me that I do not rest;I know your w^ay it is to hell.For you are not one of the eleven ;**•ry .S 2t>9n IWWt Juod .lUOVBt fiGo haste you then unto your cMy way is only unto heaven.That way is by the gate3 of hell,If you intend there for to

and sulphur burned still,With yells and cries hills did resound,The,'fiend himself c »me to the gate,And asked him where he had been jDo you not know and have forgot,Seeking this wife could not be seen.Good dame said he will you be hereI pray you then tell me your name ;The wife of Beith since that you speef,But to come in i were to blame,I will not have you then good dameFor you were mistress of the flytirig,If once within this pate you come,I will be troubled with your biting.Cummer go back and let me be,Here are too many of youi rout;For women lewd like unto thee, ?1 can pot turn my. foot about,. t.Sir thief 1 say l shall bide out,But gossip thou wast ne’er to me ;For to come in, I’m not so stout,Arid of my hiting thou’st be free ;•ii.dJ alBut Lucifer what’s that on thee ?Hast thou no wafer in this place ?Thou look’st so black it seems to me,Thou ne’er dost wash thy ugly face,If we had water here to drink,We would not care for washing then,Into these flames and filthy stink.We burn with fire in the doom :Upbraid me then goodwife no more,For first when I heard of the name j1 kne\r thou had such words in store,Would make the devil to think shame.Forsooth Sir thief thou art to blame,If I had time now to abide jOnce ye were well but may think shameThat lost heaven for rebellious pride;Who traitor-like fell with the rest,Because ye would not be content,And now of bliss are dispossest,Without all grace for to repent,Thou made'st poor Eve long sincesiia o'lfliiwgilftgw Uhi slew 8iowon arilTo eat of the forbidden tree :*(Which we her daughters may repent)And made us almost like to thee;But God he blest who past thee by.And did a Saviour provide ;For Adam’s whole posterity,AH those who do in him confide,^fdieu false fiend, 1 may not bide,With thee I may no longer stay ;rr//6cMy God in death he was my Guide,O'er hell I’ll get the victory.Then up the hill the poor wife wentOpprest with stinking flames and fear,Weeping right sore with great relent,For to go else she wist not where;a narrow way with thorns and briers,and full of mires was here before ;She sighed oft with sobs and tears.The poor wife’s heart was womWoussore;Tired and torn she went on still,Sometimes she sat and sometimes fell,aye till she came to a high hill,and then she looked back to hell.When that she had climb’d up the hill,Before her was a goodly plain ;Where she did rest and weep her fill.Then rose and to her feet again.Her heart was glad the way was goodUp to the hill she hied with haste,The flowers were fair where there shestood,The field were pleasant to her taste.The.n she espied Jerusalem,On Zion’s mount where that it stood :Shining with gold light as the sun.Her silly soul was then right glad ;The ports of pearls shining bright;Were very glorious to behold,With precious stones gave such a lightrThe walls were of traBsparent gold,high were the walls the gates were shutami long she thought for to be in \But then for fear of biding out,She knocked hard and made some din.To knock and cry she did not spareTill father Adam did her hear;Who is’t that raps so rudely there.Heaven cannot well be wen by weir.The wife of Beith since that you spier,Hath stood these two hours at the gate.Go back quoth he, thou must forbear,Here may no sinners entrance get.Adam, quolh she, I shall he in,In spite of all such churls as thee;Thou’rt the original of all sin.For which thou art not flyting free.But for thy soul offences fled.Adam went back and let her be,Looking as if his nose had bled.Then mother Eve did at him speer.Who was it there that made such din ?He said, a woman would be here,For me I durst not let her in.i’ll go, said she, and ask her will,Her company I would have fain ;But aye she cried and knocked still.And in no ways she would refrain.Daughter, said Eve, you will do well.To come a^ain another time ;Heaven is not won by sword or steel.8Nor none that’s guilty of a crime.Mother said sbe, the fault is thine,That knocking here so long 1 stand ;Thy guilt is more than that of mine,If thou wilt rightly understand,Thou wast the cause of all our sin,Wherein we were bom and conceived.Our misery thou did’st begin,By thee thy husband was deceiv’d*Eve went back where Noah was,and told him all how she was blam’dOf her great sin and first trespass,Whereof she was so much asham’d.Then Noah said 1 will go down,and will forbid her that she knock ;Go back, he said, ye drunken town.Your none of the celestial flock.Noah she said, now hold thy peace.Where 1 drank ale thou didst drink wineDiscover’d was to thy disgrace,When thou wast full like to a swine,If I was drunk I learned at theFor tjmu’rt the father and the first,That others taught and likewise me.To drink when as we had no thirst.1'hen Noah turned back with speedand told the patriarch Abrafam then.How that the carlin made him dread,And how she all his deeds did ken.Abra'am then said now get you goneLet us no more hear of your din ;;No lying wife as I suppose,May enter in these gates within.Abra’am, she said will you but spareI hope you are not flytmg free;You of yourself Had such a care,Deny’d your wife and made a lie;;Go then I pray you let me beFor I repent of all my sin.Do thou but ope the gates to me,and let me quietly come in.Abra’am went back to Jacob then,and told his grandson how to speed,How that of her nothing he wan,an 1 that he thought the carlin mad,Then down came Jacob thro* t he closeand said go backward down to hell ;Jacob quoth she I know your voice,That gate pertaineth to thyself,Of thy old trumpheiies l can tell,With two sisters thou led’st thy life,and the third part of these tribes twelveThou got with maids besides thy wife;and stole thy father’s bennison,Only by fiaud t iy father frae ;Gave thou not him for venison,A kid instead of breaken rae ?Jacob himself was tickled soHe went to Lot where he was lying,and to the gate prayed him to go,To staunch the carlin of her cryingLot says fair dame make less ado,10and come again another day.Old harlot carle and drunkard too,Thou with thine own two daughters layOf thine untimely se d I say,Proceeded nevei good but ill.Poor Lot for shame then stole away,And left the wife to knock her fill.Meek Moses then went down at last,To pacify the carlin then ;Now dame said he, knock not so fast,Your knocking will not let you ben.Good sir, she said, 1 am aghast,Whene’er I look you in the face ;If that your law till now had last,Then surely 1 had ne’er got grace :But Moses, sir, now by your leave,although in heaven you be possesst,For all you saw did not believe.But you in Horeb once transgressed,Wherefore by all it is contest.You but got up the land to see,and in the mount were put to rest.Yea buried there where yon did die.Moses meekly turned back,and told his brother Aaron there.How the old carlin did so crack,and in no ways did him forbear.Then Aaron said, I will not swear,But l‘ll conjure her as I can ;and l will make her now forbear.So that she shall not rap again.HThen Aaron said, you whorish wife,j Get you gone and rap no more ;; (With idols you have led your life,)li Or then you will repent it sore.1 Ciood Aaron priest I know you well,This golden calf you may remember.Who made the people plagues to see.The is of you recorded ever ;your priesthood now is nothing worth,Christ is my only priest, and he,My lord, who shall not keep me forth,So 1*11 get in hi spite of thee.Up started Sampson at the length.Unto the gate apace came he,To drive away the wife with strength,But all in vain it would not be.Sampson, quoth she, the world mayonim i&je,Thou was a judge that proved unjust;Those gracious gifts which God gavethee,Thou lost by thy licentious lust,From Delila thy wicked wife,Thy secrets chief couldst not refrain,She daily sought to take Ihy life,Thou lost thy locks and then was slain.Though thou wast strong it was in vainHaunted with harlots here and there.Then Sampson turned back again,And with the wife would mell nae mair.Then said king David knock no more.12We are tioubled with thy cry,David quoth she, how caoi’st thou( bsl ovfiri jjo7 gfofci liiiV-/')Thou might’st bide out as well as I,Thy dee.Is no ways thou canst deny,Is not thy sin far w'ors-e than mine?Who with Uiiah’s wife did lie,And caus’d him to be murder’d syne.Then Jedith said who’s there thatknocks,And to our neighbour "ive? these notesMadam said she Lt be your mocks,1 came not here for cutting throats :I am a sinner full of blots,Yet through Chiist’s blood I shall beclean.If you and I be judged by votes,The thing you did was worse than mineThen said the sapient Solomon,Thou art a sinner all men say,Therefore our Saviour, I suppose,Thee heavenly entrance will deny.Mind quoth she thy lattei days.What idol gods thou did upset,And wast so lewd in Venus’ plays,Thou didst thy maker quite forget.Then Jonas said fair dame content9 190 stohisrl diiw bsintraHIf you intend to come to grace.You must dree penance and repent youEre you come within this place.ISJonas quoth she how stands thje case ?How came you here to be with Christ ?How dare you look me in the face ?I Considering how you broke your tryst,To go God’s ei rand thou withstood himAnd held his council in disdain ; .The raven messenger thou play’d him.And brought no message back again ;With mercy thou wast not content.When that the Lord he did them spareAlthough the city did repent.It grieved thee thy heart was sair :Let me alone and speak no more.Go back again into the whale,For now my heart is also sore,Hut yet I hope I shall prevail.Good Jonas said crack on your fill,For here I may no longer tarry.Yet knock as long as e‘er you will.And go into a firry farry.Jonas she says ye do miscarry,As I have done in former time,You’re no Saint Peter nor Saint Mary,Thy blot’s as black as ever mine,So Jonas then lie was asham’il,Because he was not flyting free,Of all his faults she had him blam’dFie left the wife and let her be.Saint 1 horaas then / council thee,Go speak unto yon wicked wife,She shames us all, and as for me,14Her like I never heard all tny life.S Thomas then said, you make suchS sofil difa, nt om >lool uo'^ an*b wolaWhen you are out, and meikle dinIf you were here, I’ll lay my life,No peace the saints would get within jIt is your trade for 1o be fly ting,Still in a fever as one raves.No marvel though you wives be biting,Your tongues are made of aspen leavesThomas quoth she, let be your taunts,You play the pick-thank I perceive,Though ye be brother to the Saints,An unbelieving heart you have ;Thou brought the Lord unto the grave,But would no more with him remain,And wast the last of all the lave,That did believe he rose again,There might no doctrine do thee good,Nor miracles make thee confide,Till thou beheld Christ’s wounds andblood,And put’st thy hands unto his side ;Didst thou not daily with him bide,And see the wonders which he wroughtBut blest are they who do confide,And do believe yet saw him not;Thomas, she says, will you speei,I f that my sister Magdalene,Will come to me if she be here ;For comfort sure you give me nane.15He was so f)lythe he turned back,and thanked God that he was gane,He had no will to hear her crack,But told it Mary Magdalene.When she did hear her sister’s mocks,She went unto the gate with speed :and asked her who is’t that knocks?*Tis I, the wife of Beith indeed*She said £*o'od mistress you must standTill ye be tried by tribulation.Sister, quoth she, give me youf hand, *are we not both of one vocation PIt is not through your occupation,That you are placed so divine,My faith is fixed on Christ’s passion,My soul shall be as safe as thine.Then Mary went away in haste,The carlin made her so asham’d,She had no will of such a guest,To lose her pains and be so blamed.Now good St. Paul, said Magdalene,-Because you are a learned man,Go and convince this woman then,For I have done all that I can :Sure if she were in hell 1 doubt, 1They would not keep her longer thereCut to the gate would tofu hei out;and send her back to be elsewhere,Then went the good apostle Paul,To put the wife in better tune.Wash off the filth that fyles thy soul,16Then shall heav’n’s pates be open soon.Remember Raul what thou hast done,For the epistles thou didst compile,Though now thou sittest up above,Thou persecuted Christ awhile.Woman he said, thou art not ripht,That which l did, I did not know jBut thou did sin with all thy might,Although the preachers did thee show,Saint Paul, she said, it is not so,I did not know as well as ye,But 1 will to my Saviour go,Who will his favour show to me ;You think you are of flyting free,Because you were wrapt up above.But yet it was Christ’s ^raCe to thee,and matchlessness of his dear love,1 hep, Paul she says let Peter come,If he be lying let him rise,To him l will confess my sin.and let him quickly bring the keys. o/.Too long I stand, he’ll let me in,Fcr why I cannot longer tarry,Then shall ye all be quit of din,For I must speak with good saint Mary.The^ood apostle discontent.Right su idenly he turned back,For he did very much repent,To hear the carlm proudly crack,Paul says good brother now arise,and make an end of all this din,17And if be so you have the keys,Open and let the carlin in ;I The apostle Paul arose at last,and to the gate with speed he he hies,Carlin quoth he knock not so fast,You cumber Mary with your cries.Peter she Said let Christ arise,and grant me mercy in my need;i For why, ] ne'er denied him thrice,as the ugh t hyself hast done indeed,Thou carling bold what's that to thee ?II got remission for my sin ;I It cost many sad tears to me.Before I entered here within.7t will not be thy muckle din.Will cause heaven gatts opened he.Thou must be purified of sin ;and of all sins must be mafde free.Saint Peter then its nought to youThat you were rid of your fears,It was Christ’s pracious look 1 trowThai made ye wipe those bitter tears,The door of mercy is not closed,/ may get grace as well aa ye, ! *7t is nut so as ye supposedI will be in, in spite of thee.But wicked wife it is too late,Thou shouldest have mourn’d uponearth,Kepentance now is out of date :/t should have been before thy death;ISThou mightest then have turned wrathTo mercy then and mercy great,But now the Lord is very loth,and all thy crys not worth a jot.Ah ! Peter then what shall I do?He will not hear me as I hear,Shall I despair of mercy too !No, no, 1,11 trust in mercy dear:and if I perish here I’ll stay,and never go from heaven bright;I’ll ever hope and always pray,Tntil I get my Saviour’s sight.I think indeed you now are right,Jf you had faith you would win in ;Importune then with all your might.Faith is the feet wherewith you come.It is the hands will hold him fastBut, weak iaith never may presume ;'Twill let you sink and be aghast.Stongly believe, or your undone.But good Saint Peter, lei me be.Had you such faith did it abound ?When you did walk upon the sea.Were ye not likely to be drown’d ?Had not our Saviour helped thee,Who came and took thee by the hand :So can my Lord do unto me,and bring me to the promised land,Is ray faith weak Yea he is stillThe same and ever shall remain ;His mercies last and his good will,D*19To brin# me to his flock again ;He will me help and me relieve*and will increase my faith also,If weakly I can but believe,For from this place I’ll never go.But Peter said how can that be 3How dar‘st thou look him in the face ?Such horrid sinners like to thee,Can have no courage to have grace ;Here none comes in but they that’sstout,and suffer’d have for the good cause?Like unto thee are keeped cut.For thou hast kroken all Moses4 laws.Peter she said, 1 do appeal.From Moses and from thee also,With him and you I‘ll not prevail,But to my Saviour I will g-o ;Indeed of old you were right stout,When ysu did cut off Malchus’ ear ;But alter that you went about.And a poor maid then did you fear.Wherefore Saint Peter do forbear,A comforter indee 1 your not;Let me alone, 1 do not fear.Take home the wissel of your groat;Was it your own or Paul’s good swordWhen that your courage was so keen.You were right stout upon my word,Then you wpuld fain at fishing been ;For ere the crowing of the cock,/20m 1 • t »You did deny your master thrice.For all your stoutness turned a block,Now flyte no more if ye be wise.Yet at the last the Lord arose,Environed with angels bright.And to the wife in haste he goes,Desir’d her to pass out of sight,0 Lord quoth she, cause me do rightBut not according to my sin,Have you not promised day and night,When sinners knocks to let them in ?He said thou wrests the scriptureswrong.The night is come thou spent the dayIn whoredom thou hast lived long,And do repent thou didst delay;Still my commandments thou abus’dyfnd vice committed busily,Since now my mercy thou refused,Go down to hell eternally,O Lord, my soul doth testify,That 1 have spent my life in vain ;Jh! make a wandering sheep of me,y/nd bring me to thy flock again,y’nink’st thou there is no count to1 Jnot',’to I >«8iw adj enioriOf all these gifts in thee was planted,1 gave thee beauty ‘bove the lave,^4 pregnant wit thou never wanted.

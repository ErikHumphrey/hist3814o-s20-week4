Almighty and ever living God, who did snfier thinei|| -only son to be tempted hy the devil, in the wildreness,after he had fasted forty days and forty nights; and as;! thou hast been pleased at this time to defend nie from his| snares and subtilty, to rule my heart so that I was en-;; nbled to withstand all his temptations. I return lueehumble and hearty thanks for the same, for which I hopei I shall find rest at the last day ; and give thanks to myblessed Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, Amen.His master said I pray where have you run,That you no sooner unto school do come.You did not use to stay so long from me,Tell me the reason, pray, now instantly.BTIip reason that I horn the school did stay,When from my father’s house I took my way,I met the devil in the shape of a man,. Diesscd in black, who unto me did run.£He asked me whither I was going so soon,I made him an answer, no where but to school,The fittest place for such a youth as I,J’at wit'll ray reasoning he would not comply.He fain would have me go unto a ffir,Saying it was better than to come here,Which I refused, and for it him reprov’d,haying such things are what I never lov’d.Then finding that he could not me entice,Out of his pocket he pulled in a trice,A purse of gold, which he offered unto me,If I rohis advice would but agree.But all his wicked snares they were in vain,I told him a just God in heaven did reign,Whom I should serve as long as I had life,And all such vain discourse I’d banish quite.I told him what cur Saviour dear,Had suffered for us sinful mortals here,All for to save the precious souls of men,I said you’d have me crucify my Lord again.By advising me to shun God’s heavenly grace,You’d have me run a sinful wicked race,As other children in this world have done,» And daily do, but there as last will come.iA. reckoning da’/j which for it they must pay.So now this vain dhcourte forbear I pray;Then I said, sir,-though I’m but a youth,You’ll find what I have told you is the truth.But still persisted that it v'as the be:t.To follow worldly pleasures while here on earth,I little thinking who it was so nigh,Till at last his cloven feet I did espy.At which I was not daunted in the least.But did begin to upbraid him to his face ;I said, you old deceiver of mankind,Begone from me, no prey you here will find.For all your subtle snares I do defy,Your shining gold will not make me comply,I prize my soul, into a better state,Than you can pu-chase, for my Saviour’s sake.Which words being said he gave me a grim look,And in a flash of fire forsook the fields,He being vanished I fell down to pray.Unto the Lord. When being done I came away.His master when he heard what he had said,Cried out there is but few in this sad age,That ever will the conduct have to shun,The snares of Satan as you have done.8fc youths who are around, pray warning tak^ IAnd like this child all wickedness forsake,Serve God, likewise obey your parents dear.Then you the snares of Satan need not fear.Blesssed be thou, Almighty and everlasting God, who, hast redeemed us, and given us grace to withstand themany snares and temptations of the devil. We humblybeseech thee, to keep us from all evil thoughts and vaindesire'S, so that whatsoever we do may contribute to thyhonour and glory, and \ve, thy servants may be henceforthdefended by thy mighty power, from all assaults of our \enemies, and this we beg for the sake of Jesus Christ,Amen.FIXI

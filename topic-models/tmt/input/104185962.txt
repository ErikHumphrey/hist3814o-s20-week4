THEKing’s Daughter;TOOETIlEIi WITHCATHERINE JOHNSTONE.GLASGOW.PHIN1KD FOR THE JiOOKSELLERS,77.THE KING’S DAUGHTER.It was a lord and a gentle maidSat in a greenwood bower.And thus the brave Sir Alfred saidTo the greenwood’s fairest flower:—“I have loved thee well, sweet Rosalie,—With thee I could live and die ;But thou art a maid of low degree,And of princely race am I.• '** ‘ •“ I have loved thee well, sweet Rosalie,I have loved a year and a day ;But a different fate is in store for me,And I must no longer stay.“ Thou art a cottage maiden, love,And know not thy own pedigree ;And I must marry the king’s daughter,For she is betrothed to me.”There was a smile on Rosalie’s lip,But a tear in her blue eye shone ;The smile was all for her lover’s fate.The tear perchance for her own.3And down fell her ringlets of chestnut hair,Down in a shower of gold ;And she hid her face in her lover’s arms.With feelings best left untold.Then slowly rose she in her bower,With something of pride and scorn.And she look’d like a tall and dewy flowerThat lifts up its head to the morn.She flung her golden ring’ets aside,And a deep blush crimson’d her cheek,—“ Heaven bless thee, Alfred, and thy young brine,Heaven give you the joy you seek!“ Thou wert not born for a cottage, love.Nor yet for a maiden of low degree ;Thou wilt find thy mate in the king’s daughter—Forget and forgive thy Rosalie.”Sir Alfred has flung him upon his steed,But he rides at a laggard pace ;Of the road he is travelling he takes no heed,And a deadly paleness is on his face.Sir Alfred has come to the king’s palace,And slowly Sir Alfred has lighted down ;Ho sigh’d when he thought of the king’s daughter—He sigh’d when he thought of her father’s crown.“ Oh! that my home were the greenwood bower,Under the shelter of the greenwood tree !Oh! that my strength had been all my dower.All my possessions Rosalie ! ”Sir Alfred has entered the royal hall'Midst a thousand nobles in rich array ;But he who was once more gay than all,Has never, 1 ween, one word to say.The king sat high on his royal throne,Though his hairs were grey, his arm was strong,“ Good cousin,” he said, in a jocund tone,“ Is it thou or thy steed that has stay’d so long?" But it boots not now—Bring forth the bride !Thou hast never yet my daughter seen ;A woeful fate it is thine to bide,Fcr her hair is red and her eyes are green!The bride came forth in a costly veil,And nought of her face could Alfred see ;But his cheek grew yet more deadly pale.And he fell down faltering upon his knee :“ Pardon! pardon! my liege, my king!And let me speak while I yet am free ;But were she fair as the flowers of spring,To your daughter I never can husband be.”Lightning flash’d from the king’s fierce eye,And thunder spoke in his angry tone,—“ Then the death of a traitor thou shalt die.And thy marriage peal shall bo torture’s moan ! ”“ I never fear’d to die, Sir King,But my plighted faith I fear to break;I never fear’d the grave's deep rest,But the pangs of conscience I fear to wake.”5Out then spoke the king’s daughter,And haughtily spoke she,—“ If Sir Alfred is vow’d to another love.He shall never be claim’d by me ;—If Sir Alfred is vow’d to another love,Why, let the knight go free ;Let him give his hand to his other love.There are hundreds as good as he! ”With a careless touch she threw back her veil.As if it by chance might be ;And who do you think was the king’s daughter?—His own—his long-loved Rosalie!First he stood like a marble stone,And she like a lily sweet,Then a sunny smile o’er his features shone.And then he was at her feet.CATHERINE JOHNSTONE.There was a lass as I heard say,Lived low doun in a glen ;Her name was Catherine Johnstone,Weel known to many men.Doun came the laird o’ Lamington,Doun frae the south countrie ;And he is for this bonnie lass,Her bridegroom for to be.6He’s ask’d her father and mother,The chief of a* her kin';And then he ask’d the bonnie lass,And did her favour win.Doun came an English gentleman,Doun from the English border ;He is for this bonnie lass,To keep his house in order.He ask’d her father and mother,As I do hear them saj ;But he never ask’d the lass herseF,Till on her wedding day.But she has wrote a long letter,And seal’d it with her hand:And sent it to lord Lamington,To let him understand.The first line o’ the letter lie read,He was baith glad and fain.But or he read the letter o’er,He was baith pale and wan.Then he has sent a messenger,And out through all his land ;And four-and-twenty armed men,Were all at his command.But he has left his merry men all;Left them on the lee ;And he’s awa’ to the wedding house.To see what he could see.7But when he came to the wedding house.As I do understand ;There were four and twenty belted knights,Sat at a table round.They rose all to honour him,For he was of high renown ;They rose all for to welcome him,And bade him to sit down.O meikle was the good red wine,In silver cups did flow ;But aye she drank to Lamington,For with him would she go.0 meikle was the good red wine,In silver cups gaed round ;At length they began to whisper words,None could them understand.“ O came ye here for sport, young man.Or came ye here for play ?Or came ye for our boiinie bride,On this her wedding day?”“ I came not here for sport,” he said,“ Neither did 1 for play ;But for one word o’ your bonnie bride.I’ll mount and go away.”They set her maids behind her,To hear what they would say ;But the first question lie ask’d at her,Was always answered nay ;8The next question he ask’d at her.Was “ Mount and come away?”It’s up the Couden bank,And doun the Couden brae ;And aye she made the trumpet sound,It’s a weel won play.O meikle was the blood was shed.Upon the Couden brae ;And aye she made the trumpet sound.It’s a’ fair play.Come a’ ye English gentlemen,That is of England born jComo na doun to Scotland,For fear ye get the scorn.They’ll feed ye up wi’ flattering words,And that’s foul play ;And they’ll dress you frogs instead of fish.Just on your wedding day

ALine from you would be very ac¬ceptable. \Vhen you do write, letme have a particular Account of the Seced¬ing Brethren, viz. Meffieurs Ershines, &c.how it goes with them, what Pr©grefs theymake. 1—  We of Nc-ue-Tork,, havebeen lately favoured with a fliort Vifit from thatexcellent young Evangelift, the Reverend andfamous Mr. George Whitefield, in his Voyage toGeorgia. Afl'oon as he arrived here, he appliedhimielf to the Parlon of the Engl ip Church,( as his Manner is) for the Uie of his Church,which was denied him: Application was aliomade to the Dutch, for their large Church,which being alio denied him, he went out andpreached in the Fields, to a very large Auditoryof all Profeiftons, Je-zvs and Gentiles, fome ofW'hich, viz. the Rakes of the Town, came (asthey afterwards told) with W hi dies in their Poc¬kets, onPurpoie to mock and difturb him: But,behold the Power of the Word, when backed byth: Spirit, quickly catch’d them, and made themchange their Mind, fo as ever afterwards theywere coniiant and devout Hearers of him. Be¬ing denied the other Churches, and the Weatherbemg*excrffive cold, we offered him our Church,which he was plealed to accept of, and leftu redwhichthat Evening to above fifteen hundred People,and lb he continued to preach and lecture everyDay, while he flayed in the Place, which wasbut four Days. 1 can freely lay, I never heardMan 1'peak like him, his Matter and Do£lrineentirely Apoftolick 5 chiefly infilling upon, andprefling home, the ablolutely neceflary funda¬mental Points and Duties of Chriftianity, iuchas, Regeneration, Repentance, Faith in the LordJeius, denying of ourfelves, and all Dependenceon our own Righteoulhefs, and depending onlyon the Righteoufnefs of Chrift for Juftification,£5?t. He is no Party-man j but makes it his con-llant Bufinels to efpoufe, and gain Souls to theLord Jefus Chrifl: in a Gofpel-way, much likethe Reverend Meflieurs Er ski lies in their Sonnetsand Sermons, with whom he told me he keeps aCorrefpondence, and whole Works he heartilyrecommends.—7-J/y dear Friend, I would fainhope theie are the Beginnii gs of glorious Times.I cannot but think they are the Dawmngs of ahappy reviving Day to the formal, drowly, droop¬ing Churches of Chrift throughout the World thisDav.

IX.T Now let my lelf down, according to my Pro-mile, and your Permiffion, to do that bythe Hand of a Friend, which I was not able todo with my own, and which I had not Time totouch upon in my Jaft Letter 5 I mean, to givefome Account of the State of Religion Abroad,according to the Account I have got from CountZinzimlorff in a Letter, which I received fromhim about the Middle of December laft.   You may remember, that I told you formerly, thatthis holy Man had laid afide his lecular Employ¬ments and Dignities, and devoted himfelf to thePaftoral Care of a Church, confillinp chiefly of aconfiderable Number of pious< Moravians, whohad fled from their native Country on Account ofPeriecution, and by his Encouragement fixedthemfelves at Hermit/X It is fotnething moreth in a Twelve. Month, perhaps, near two Yearsfince, by the Severity of the King of "Poland, un¬der the InfHgation of the Yefuits, they were dri¬ven from thence, and the Count obliged to partwith his Eftate there. Bur, God has been pleal-led, as in mi^ny former Inftances, to over-rule thisPeriecution for the Good of his Church. Forw hereas, before they had lent out their Miffiona-ries into leveral Parts of the.World ; and where¬as 1 think ( I told y ou ) fomc or other of themcontinually Night and Day prayed tor their Suc-ceis, and the Propagation of the Gofpel in theW orld ; lo they looked upon this Providence as aC ill to abound more and more in this good Work.They have indeed fixed their Head quarters at aPI>;c called Hernaag, near Frankfort on theRhineRhine Foot, from whence they have fent, and ar6fending many more into various Parts of theWorld $ and the Accounts, which, their Doftorand honoured Paftor lends me of their part Suc-cefs and future Scheme, are as follow. He tellsme, that he is intending a Journey into Switzer¬land, which (as I am informed in a Letter fromthe pious Mr. T'horold) he has iince performed,and I am ready to imagine, he is ftill tne-re. Hetells me, that ‘Bern, Bafil, Stein, Malhaujenyand Scaffhaufen, have all of them received theGofpel in its Power and Purity, from the Mora¬vian Brethren, who, wherever they come, are at¬tempting a Work of Reformation, and a Revivalof Religion amongft Proteftants as well as Papifts.And indeed the languide State of many of theForeign Churches leems greatly to need luch At¬tempts. The Count adds, That Geneva itlelfisimpreft with their Labours 5 tho’ be fays, it hasbeen for a long Time fo taken up with ‘Philofo-fhy, as hardly to be able (to bear the Reproachof the Crols : He adds, that the Churcnes inEcthonia and Swenia flourilh $ and that thebarbarous Inhabitants of that Province do Svenpant after Chrift. Greenland relbunds with theGolpel, and leveral of the idolatrous Inhabi¬tants are baptized. But the Count adds, that hecannot approve of the Methods taken by fome oftheir Brethren there, who lean to be lb intent onfpreading Philolbphical Knowledge there, ,thathe fears, the Gofpel of Chrift fuffers Ibme Detri¬ment by it. The moll furprifing Article of allis, that their Miflionaries to the Cape of goodJ/ope meet with Ibme Encouragement, and thatthirty Hottentots have given up their Names toChrift, and no lefii than a thoufand Negroes inthe I {land of St. Thomas, who have been weltinftru&ed into that Religion, into which theywere baptifed, and have embraced it as a Matter offree and reaibnable Choice. Their Miffionaries toGeorgia,Cttrolina,cPehfilvania,t\\eCoaft.ofj8a_r-hary in [Africa, and that of Surinam in the We(lIndies, ate as yet efcpe&ing the Fruit of their La¬bours. And Fifteen, who are now at Virginia,having, for fome Time, employed themlelves inlearmnp the various Languages of the Indian •I\ inons, are preparing to let out on a Progrels a-mongft them, for the blefled Purpofe of carryingtht Lews of Salvation to them. There arelomea Ceylon in the V, f-Indies 5 but the Count had.rec: md.no Letter from them, when he wrote tome. Le teals me alio, That Lapland, Ainfcovy,WaUaehia, and Conftantinople, are all vifited byfome of the Brethren, who preach among them,( . tar as 1 can learn ) without Reftraint, but,whh what Succels he does not mention, excepting-onl>, tha', by their Meat s, an hundred Turkijj)Prifoners (taken, I iuppoie, by the Ruffians inthe late War) have embraced Chriftianity. Theonly News that he had lately received from Ge¬noa was, That a converted Ncgrce, living there,.was endeavouring to ere£f Schools in the neigh¬bouring Parts, with a View to the Propagationof Chriftian Knowledge. The Brethren, w^howere lent to preach in the Northern Parts of Po¬land, have been for fome Time confined there, but.are now returned again, and are very follicitous tofind out fome. Way'to prolecute that good W ork,which has been interrupted by the Perfecution oftheir Enemies. The Count informed me, thatthey intend quickly to vifit other Parts of thepaji Indies, the Savages of New-Tork, and^thejlTagi of ‘Terfia: He concludes with telling me,That Churches, on their reformed Plan, are erec¬ted in LuJ'atia, Saxony, ‘Brandenburg, Brunf-nvick, Jlljatia, Swabia, Franconia, Wirtenberg,the ‘Palatinate, feveral imperial Cities, Holland,and the other States on the Rhine. What follows,is merely perional, but expreffive of great Ten-dernels and Humility : And the whole doles withthole emphatical Words, which I before tranfcrib-ed, but which I do not think much to repeat ;Farewell in Chrifi our common Lord, 'our cruci¬fied, wounded, only healing Ranfom, by whomwe are redeemed from the Pit of everlafting LJe-firuBion, e§ho is to me thedearefi of all Objeffs.I think, any Thing I could add, after this reviv¬ing and aftonifhing Account of the Work of Godupon, and by theie his faithful Servants, wouldbe but flat and infipid.P.

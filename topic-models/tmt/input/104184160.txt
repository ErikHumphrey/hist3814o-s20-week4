THEHISTORYOFWill and Jean.PART I.Wha was ance like Willie Gairlace—Wha, in neighbouring town or farm ?Beauty’s bloom shone in his fair face,Deadly strength was in his arm !Wha wi’ Will could rin or wrestle,Through the sledge or toss the bar ?Hap what would he stood a castle,Or for safety or for war.Warm his heart, and mild as manfu’,With the bauld he bauld could be;But to friends who had their handfu’,Purse and service aye were free.When he first say Jeanie Miller,Wha wi’ Jeannie could compare ?Thousands had mair braws and siller,But were any half sae fair.4Soft her smile raise like May morning,Glinting owre Denmait’s* brow ;Sweet! wi’ opening charms adorningStirling’s lovely plains below.Kind and gentle was her nature ;At ilka place she bore the bell;Sic a bloom, and shape, and stature—But her look nae tongue can tell!Such was Jean when first, mawing,Spied her on a thrawart beast;Flew like fire, and just w’hen fa’ing,Kepp’d her on his manly breast.Light he bore her, pale as ashes,’Cross the meadow, fragrant, green,Placed her on the new-mawn rashes,Watching sad her opening een.Such was Will, when poor Jean, fainting,Drapped into a lover’s arms;Wakened to his soft lamenting,Sighed, and blushed a thousand charms.Soon they lo’ed and soon were buckled;Nane took time to think and rue :Youth and worth and beauty coupled—Love had never less to do.Three short years flew by fu’ canty, fJean and Will thought them but ane;Ilka day brought joy and plenty,Ilka year a dainty wean.Will wrought sair, but aye wi’'pleasure,PJean, the hale day spun and sang—Will and weans, her constant treasure,Blest wi’ them nae day seemed lang.*One of the Ochil Hills, near Stirline:. t Happily.5'Neat her house, and, Oh !

”Starting, wi’ remorse distracted,Crushed wi’ griefs increasing load,Up he banged; and, sair afflicted,Sad and silent took the road.Sometimes briskly, sometimes flaggin’,Sometimes helpit, Will got forth ;On a cart, or in a waggon,Hirplin’ aye towards the north.Tired ae e’enin’, stepping hooly,Pondering on his thrawart fate,In the bonny month o’ July,Willie, heedless, tint his gate.Soft the southlin breeze was blawin’,Sweetly sughed the green aik wood;Loud the din o’ streams fast fa’ing,Strak the ear wi’ thundering thud.Ewes and lambs on brae ran bleeting,Linties chirped on ilka tree;Frae the west, the sun, near setting,Flamed on Roslin’s towers* sae hie.Roslin Castle.19Roslin’s towers, and braes sae bonnie,Craigs and water, woods and glen—Roslin’s banks, unpeered by ony,Save the Muses’ Hawthornden !

and sad and manyAre the ills poor mortals share ;Yet, though hame nor bed ye ha’e na,Yield na, soldier, to despair.What’s this life, sae wae and wearie,If hope’s bright’ning beams should fail ?See—though night comes dark and eerie,Yon sma’ cot-light cheers the dale.There, though wealth and waste ne’er roit,Humbler joys their comforts shed—Labour, health, content, and quiet;Mourner, there ye’ll find a bed.Wife, ’tis true, wi’ bairnies smiling,There, alas ! ye needna seek—Yet there bairns, ilk wae beguiling,Paint wi’ smiles a mothers cheek :A’ her earthly pride and pleasureLeft to cheer her widowed lot;A’ her worldly wealth and treasureTo adore her lonely cot.Cheer, then, soldier ! ’midst afflictionBright’ning joys will often shine;Virtue aye claims Heaven’s protection—Trust to Providence divine ! ”PART VI.Sweet as Rosebank’s woods and river,Cool when summer’s sunbeams dart,Came ilk word, and cooled the feverThat lang burned at Willie’s heart.21£Silent he stepped on puir fellow!Listening to his guide before,Owre green knowe and flowery hallow,Till they reached the cot-house door.Laigh it was, yet sweet though humble,Decked wi’ honeysuckle round ;Clear below, Esk’s waters rumble,Deep glens murmuring back the sound.Melville’s towers,* sae white and stately,Dim by gloamin’ glint to view ;Through Lasswade’s dark woods keek sweetlySkies sae red, and lift sae blue.Entering now, in transport mingleHither fond and happy wean,Smiling round a canty ingle,Bleazin’ on a clean hearth-stane.“ Soldier, welcome !

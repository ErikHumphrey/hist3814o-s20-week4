His Px-ophecies have beenmore credited than any that were ever recordedin the Scots Chronicle, as they have been well at¬tested, what of them is past, and what they alludeto, in this present certury and period, and of hisdark sayings yet to come.He told many mystical prophecies anent all theKings of Europe, and what fell out according tohis prediction, in this ancient kingdom of Scotlandwhat is past, present, and to come.This brief account is taken from the Record ofCryle, near which place he was born and broughtup.His father was said to be Laird of Balcomie andthe records of that family is extant in the Rolls,for assisting at several councils for the honour of.Scotland. And Sir Thomas Rhymer’s propheciesand sayings are still held in estimation.\lie lived in the reign of Alexander III. Kingol Scotland, in the year one thousand two hundredand forty-eight, much regarded, and knighted bythat king that same year.1 he first of his prophecies ever taken to he faith¬fully observed, was, that there should be a storm ona certain day, that would surprise all Scotland..\ow, some gentlemen being with him that daythey began to joke him, and said Sir Thomas, youare now mistaken, and we shall stay and see yourmistake, as we have heard so much of your prophe¬cies. He told them to stay an hour longer, andthey would see and believe. And in less time thanan hour, an express arrived to Sir Thomas fromEdinburgh, of thl death of Margaret, Queen toAlexander III. who died that day. Upon receiv¬ing the news, Sir Thomas told them that this wasthe storm, and it would give rise to greater com¬motions in Scotland.After the death of Queen Margaret, the Kingmarried Isabel, daughter to the Earl of Driux;and Sir Thomas told within a few months of anearthquake at Kinghorn, that would make Scotlandtremble. An express accordingly came to Clyde jto Sir Thomas, that the King had fallen from hishorse at Kinghorn, and broke hia neck. After thedeath of Alexander, he left no heirs except a grand- |child, Margaret, daughter to the King of Norway,who also soon died; but a short time before herdeath, she was betrothed to Edward, King of Eng¬land. After this there were great commotionsanent the succession to the crown of Scotland,which occasioned great blood-shed, particularly be¬twixt Bruce and Baliol, which you have recordedin the Scottish Histories.The pride of Spain, and the deceitful conduct ofthe French, as also concerning the Dutch, is allforetold.—Likewise the Scots battles at Torwood,Bothwelbridge, Malpiackie, Killycrankie, Sheriff-muir. Proud Preston, near Gladamuir, Falkirk,Culloden, and the Camps in Moray-shire, and onthe Windmill brae at Aberdeen, by General Coup,and at Dunbar.In forty-five eighty-two and three,Sir Thomas’ Works doth certify.-■ 11 ^ ! -THEPROPHECIESOFThomas the Rhymer*As to his prophetical sayings, they are hard to beunderstood, because they are pointed out by theCoat of Arms which appertain to so many differentkingdoms and persons. Yet we may observe howlie has pointed out plainly, many things which havecome to pass in our days; such as the extirpation ofthe noble race of the Stewarts, the Revolutionof Sheriffmuir, where he says,That three Ships and a Shield,That day shall keep the field;And be the Antelop’s build.These three ships and a shield, are in the Dukeof Argyle’s arms.And even every particular of the rebellion in1745 and 1746. When pointing at it, he says,A Chieftain unchosen,Shall choose forth himself,And the realm as his own.When speaking of King Charles, he calls himc A sly Fox-bird who would turn to Christ withthe,wyles of tods and foxes,’ meaning his swearingof the covenants.When speaking of the battle of Prestonpans, inthe year 1745, he names the very two neighbour-/i ng villages to the spot of ground whereon it vvu«."ought, viz, Coyleford-green, and Seton, saying.| Between Seton and the sea, sorrow should hewrought by the light of the moon.—hich act.ireally ■ came to pass that morning the battle otiPrestonpans was fought. But how the Lioir wasthurt at this time, and not perceived, is yet a mys.|tery. Some are of opinion, that it was by takenaway the power or superiority from the chiefs ofthe Highland Clans, so that they cannot raise menin such a short time as formerly.These are a few observations on things alreadyl come to pass ; and as what is yet to come, there is(some remark will yet happen, when the time drawsij nigh ; such as, ‘ When Tarbet’s Craigs are tumbledunto the sea. And the next season or summerthereafter, great sorrow and bloodshed happen tothis realm, the chief thereof especially, such as bar¬ling on sleds, and chopping off heads.’ d his 1 ar-bet stands near the root of the river Clyde; hutwhether its being tumbled into the sea shall hap¬pen by an earthquake, thunder, or by the hands otmen, is a mystery unknownThere is also mention made of a Lord with alucken or double hand, which certainly is of^ royali blood, and will breed great stir and confusion inBritain. This man is alive at this very presentage, and of the Stewarts’ race, now in Italy-.There is plainly pointed out, that in his time, a•great battle should be seen in Fife,Where saddled horses should be seen,Ty’d into the trees green.Not only in Fife, but the four chief rivers ot therealm, there should be a battle on each of them,I that should make the rivers run with blood, viz: —Tweed, Clyde, Forth, and Tay8of all, a bloody desperate battle in Norfluunber and, on the river Tyne. Also great ha.vock and slaughter about the broad walls of Ber iwiek. All these things are yet to come to pass, 'v"e" the first :>PP^ai-s, the rest will soon foblow after.When Hkmp is come and also gone.-Scotland and England shall be one.Henry.VIII.'Edward.VI.Mary,Philip, Elzabeth.of Spain.Q.

After¬wards, to the same purpose, these, and manyother strange things were foretold by Tho¬mas Learmant, vulgarly called Thomas Rhymer,■jmi wmr i9because he spoke all his prophetical sayings inrhyme and so darkly that they could not be under¬stood until they came to pass.But of all the prophets that ever were in Scot¬land, none of them attained to such credit, becausemany of his predictions referred to our own country,and were accomplished in the last and presentcentury.THOMAS THE RHYMER’SJPR OPHECSES,■ 'j - ,jl ' : ■ • - r AIN VERSE.1 SCOTLAND be sad now and lament,For honours thou hast lost,But yet rejoice, in better times.Which will pay the cost.•2 Tho’ unto thraldom you should be,Brought by your enemies;You shall have freedom from them all.And enjoy your liberties.The grave of the most noble prince,To all is great regret,The subject to law, who both leaveThe kingdom and estate.4 O anguish great! where every kindAnd ages doth lament;Whom bitter death has ta’en away.Shall Scotland sore repent.Lately a lamb of rich increase,A nation stout and true.Has lost their former dear estate.Which they did hold of due.» By hard conflict, and by the chanceOf noble fortune’s force.Thy hap and thy prosperityMay turn into worse.Tho’ wont to won, may be subdued.And come in under yoke ;Stranges may reign, and you destroy,What likes him by sword’s stroke.B A foreign foe whom neither thy force.Nor manners do approve.Woe is to thee, Vy guile and slightWill only win above.9' This mighty nation was to.fore.Invincible and stout,Will yeild slowly to destiny,Great pity is but doubt.10 In former age the Scots renownDid flourish goodly gay !But yet alas ! will be overcomeWith a great dark decay.11Then mark and see what is the causeOf this so wond rous fall!Contempt of faith, falsehood, deceit,The wrath of God withal.1— Unsatiable greed of worldly gain,Oppression, cries of the poor ;A perpetual and slanderous race.No justice put in ure.1113 The haughty pride of mighty men,Of former vice chief cause,The nutriture of wickedness,An unjust match of laws.14 Therefore this cause the prophetsOf long time did presage ;And now has happen’d every pointInto your present age.15 Since fate is so, now Scotland learnIn patience to abide,Slanders, great fears, and sudden plagues,And great dolours beside.16 For out of thee shall people rise,With divers happiness ;And yet a pen can scarcely write,Thy hurt, skaith, and distress,17 And yet beware thou not distrust,Altho’ o’erwhelm’d with grief,Thy stroke is not perpetual,For thou shall find relief.18 I do suppose, altho’ too late,Old prophecies shall hold,Hope thou in God’s goodness evermore,And mercies manifold.19 For thou that now a patient is,And seemeth to be bound ;At liberty shall free be set,And with empire be crown’d.20 From high above shall grace come down.And thy state, Scotland, be,In latter ends, more prosperousThan former age shall see.iJL1221 Old prophecies foretell to thee,A warlike heir he’s born,ho shall recover new your right,Advance this kingdom's horn.22 Then shall fair Scotland be advanc'dAbove her enemies power;Her cruel foes shall be dispers’d.And scatter d from her bower.23 Fair Scotia’s enemies may invade,But not escape a plague’;With sword, and thrist, and tears, and nestWith fears, and such like ague.

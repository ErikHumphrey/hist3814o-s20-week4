Being market out by those monsters ofimpiety as their prey, I was cajoled on board theship by them, where I was no sooner got, thanthey conducted me between the decks to someothers they had kidnapped in the same manner.At that time, I had no sense of the fate that wasdestined for me, and spent the time in childish4amlisements with my fellow-sufferers hi'the i&teet--age, being never suffered to go upon deck whilstthe vessel lay in the harbour. nniJahdO'•c In about a mottth’s time the ship set1 sail forAmerica. I cannot forget that, whert we-arrivedon the coast we were destined for, a hard galetffwind sprung up from the S. E. and, to the cap¬tain's great surprise (he not thinking he was nearland, although having been 11 weeks on the pass¬age), about twelve o’clock at night, the shipstruck on a sand bank off Cape May, near theCapes of Delaware, and, to the great terror atidaffright of the ship’s companyi in a short timewas almost full of water. The boat was thenhoisted out, into which the captain and his fel¬low villians, the crew, got with some difficulty,leaving me and my deluded companions to perish,as they then naturally concluded inevitable deathto be our fate. Often, in my distresses andmiseries since, have I wished that such had beenthe'consequence, when in a state of innocence !But Providence thought proper to resenvb mefor future trials of its goodness. Thus abandonedand deserted, without the least prospect of relief,but threatened every moment with death, dirthese Villians leave us. The cries, the shrieks-,and tears of a parcel of infants, had ho effect on,or caused the least remorse in the breasts of thesemerciless wretches. Scarce can I say to which!*5to tfive.'the;pfefereiie£S. whetiu'r to socl) as these,who, have had-the opportmuty of knowing theChristian religion t or to, the savages herein afterdieseribed, wl»o pfofane not the gospel, or boastof humanity; and if they act in a pipre brutal and.butcherly manner, yet it is to their enemies, fordhe sake; of plunder and the rewards offered themilbr their prmciplesaJ’e, alike^+the love of .sordidgain i)tang both their motives. The ship being-on: aJand.i^ank, which did not give way to lether deeper, M’e lay in the.same deplorable condi¬tion until morning, when, though w& saw tV‘landrof Cape May, at about a miles distance,;^eknew not what would ba^wir fate.;The wind at iengtli . abated, and the captain,miwiMing to lose all hei- cargo, about.ten o’clock,Sent some of his erevv in aToat to the ship’s sid^*to bring us on shore, whei^ Wie, lay in a sort of acamp,-nuide of the saiisjof (the vessel, and suphother.- thing* as we could get, - The .provisionslastedns : until we were .taken in by a vessel boundto Philadelphia,,lying on this island, as well, ps1 ■ean-irecolloef, near three, weeks.

faithless, she’s no the less fair,And the thought of her beauty but feeds my despair^With painful remembrance my bosom is full,And weary of life is the Harper of Mull.As slumbering I lay by the dark mountain stream,My lovely young Rosie appeared in my dream;I thought her still kind and I ne’er was sae blest.As in fancy I clasped the dear nymph to my breast:Thou false fleeting vision, too soon

broom sae yellow,I loan’d me ’neath the milkwhite thorn,On natures mossy pillow ;Around my seat the flow’rs were strew’d,That frae the wildwood I had pu’d.To weave mysel’ a simmer snood,To pleasure my dear fellowI twin’d the woodbine round the rose,Its richer hues to mellow,Green sprigs of fragrant birk I choseTo busk the sedge sae yellow.The craw-flow’r blue, and meadow pink,I wove in primrose braided link.But little, little did I think,I should have wove the willow.My bonnie lad was forced afar,Toss’d on the raging billow,Perhaps he’s fa’n in bludy war,Or wrecked on rocky shallow;Yet, aye I hope for his return,As round our wonted haunts I mourn,And aften by the woodland burn,I pu’ the weeping willow.MOLLY, MY DEAR.The harvest is o’er, and the lads are so funny.Their hearts lined with love and their pockets withmoney ;From morning till night, 'tis “ My jewel, my honey,“ Ooh, go to the North with me, Molly, my dear 1 ”19Youeg Dennot holds on with Ids swooi LotL-oiatioa^And swears

me love songs of the Lakes of Killarney,In worth from my Dermot he’s twenty miles journey.My heart bids me tell him I’ll ne’er be his dear.”ELLEN MORE.The sun had kissed green Erin's waves.The dark blue mountains towered between,Mild evening’s dews refreshed the leaves.The moon, unclouded, rose serene:When Ellen wandered forth unseen,All lone her sorrows to deplore;False was her lover, false her friend.And false was hope to Ellen More.Young Henry was fair Ellen’s love,Young Emma to her heart was dear,Nor weal nor woe did Ellen prove,But Emma ever seemed to share:Yet envious still, she spread the wileThat sullied Ellen’s virtues o’er;Her faithless Henry spnmed the while,His fair, his faithful Ellen More./29She wandered down Loch-Mary side,Where oft at evening hour she stoleTo meet her love with secret pride;Now deepest anguish wrung her soul.O'ercome with grief she sought the steep,Where Yarrow falls with sullen roar;Oh! Pity, veil thy eyes and weep,A bleeding corpse lies Ellen More.The sun may shine on Yarrow braes,And woo the mountain flowers to bloom.But never can his golden raysAwake the flower in yonder tomb.There oft young Henry strays forlorn,When moonlight gilds the abbey tower;There oft from eve till breezy mom.He weeps his faithful Ellen More.COGGIE, THOU HEALS ME.Dorotht sits i’ the cauld ingle neuk.Her red rosy neb’s like a labster tae;Wi’ girning, her mou’s like the gab o’ the fleuk,Wi’ smokin’, her teeth’s like the jet o’ the slae. |And aye she sings weels me, aye she sings weels mfCoggie, thou heals me, coggie, thou heals me,Aye my best friend, when there’s ony thing ails me,Ne’er shall we part till the day that I die.Dorothy ance was a weel tocher’d lass,Had charms like her uei’bours, an’ lovers anew,But she spited them sae, wi’ her pride and her sauce,They left her for thirty lang summers to rue.Then aye s%e sang waes me, aye she sang waes me,0 i’ll turn crazy, 0 I’ll turn crazy,Naething in a’ the wide world can ease me,De’il take the wooers—0 what shall I do.>rothy, doaon’d wi’ living her lane,Pu’d at her rock, wi’ the tear in her e’e,ue thought on the braw merry days that were gane,A.nd cafl a wee coggie for company,ow aye she sings weels me, aye she sings weels me,iggie thou heals me, coggie thou heals me,ye my best friend, when there's ony thing ails me,rer shall we part, till the day that I die.MY MARY.Mr Mary is a bonnie lassie,Sweet as dewy mom,When fancy tunes her rural reed,Beside the upland thorn.She lives ahint yon sunny knowe,Where flowers in wild profusion grow.Whore spreading birks and hazels throwTheir shadows o’er the burn.Tis no the streamlet skirted wood,Wi’ a’ its leafy bow’rs,That gars me wait in solitudeAmong the wild sprung flow’rs;But aft I cast a langing e’e,Down frae the bank out-owre the lea,There haply I my lass may see,As through the broom she scours.Yestreen 1 met my bonny lassieComing frae the town,We raptur’d sunk in ither’s armsAnd prest the breckans down;The paitrick sung his e’ening note,The rye-craik rispt his clam’rous throat,While there the heav nly vow I got,That erl’d her my own.KITTY TYRELL.Tfs breeKe of the night fans the dark mountain'sbreast,Amd the light bounding deer have all sunk to theirrest;The big sullen ■waves lash the loch’s rockj shore,And the lone drowsy fisherman nods o’er his oar;Tho’ pathless the moor, and tho’ starless the skies,The star of my heart is my Kitty’s bright eyes;And joyful I hie over glen, brake, and fell,In secret to meet my sweet Kitty Tyrell.Ah! long we have loved in her father’s despite,And oft we have met at the dead hour of night,When hard-hearted Vigilance, sunk in repose,Gave Love one sweet hour its fVmd tale to disclose.These moments of transport, to me, oh! how dear!And the fate that would part us, alas, how severe!Altho’ the rude storm rise with merciless swell,This night I shall meet my sweet Kitty Tyrell.‘ Ah! turn, hapless youth, see the dark cloud ofdeath.Comes rolling in gloom o’er the wil 1 haunted heath;Deep groans the scathed oak on the glen’s cliffy brow,Vnd the sound of the torrent seems heavy with woe.”Away, foolish seer, with thy fancies so wild.Go tell thy weak dreams to some credulous child,hove guides my light steps < Oro’ the lone dreary delLAnd I fly to the arms of my sweet Kitty Tyrell.MINE AIN DEAR SOMEBODY.When gloaming treads the heels of day.And birds sit oouring on the spray,Alaug the flowery hedge I strayTo meet mine ain dear somebody23The scented brier, the fragrant bean.The clover bloom, the dewy green,V charm me, as I rove at e’en,To meet mine ain dear somebodyLet warriors prize the hero’s name,Let mad ambition tower for fame,I’m happier in my lowly hams,Obscurely blest with somebodyHEART IS SAIR WI’ HEAVY CARBLMy heart is sair with heavy care,To think on Friendship’s flcldo smile,It blinks a wee, with kindly e’e,When world’s thrift runs w cl the while;But, let Misfortune’s tempests low’r,It soon turns cold, it soon turns sour,It looks sae high and scornfullyIt winna ken a poor man’s door.I ance had siller in my purse,I dealt it out right frank and free.And hop’d, should Fortune change her course.That they would do the same for me.But, weak in wit, 1 little thoughtThat Friendship’s smiles were sold and bought.Till ance 1 saw, like April snatv,Fltey wan’d awa’ when I had uonuht.It’s no to see my thread-baro coat-It’ 's no to see my coggie teem,ft’s e© to wair my hindmost groat,That gars me fret, and gars me gloom.But ’tss to see the scornful prideThat honest Poortith aft maun bid©Frae selfish slaves, and sordid knaves,Wha stp.it with Fortune on their side.HBut let it gang, what de’il care I,With eident thrift I’ll toil for mair,I’ll half my mite with Misery,But Sent a ane of them shall share.With soul unbent, I’ll stand the stour,And while they’re flutt’ring past my door,I’ll sing with glee, and let them seeAn honest heart can ne’er be poor.TUG LASSIE O’ MERRY EIGHTEENMr father wad ha’e me to marry the miller,My mither wad ha’e me to marry the laird,But brawly I ken it’s the love o’ the siller,That brightens their fancy to ony regard;The miller is crookit, the miller is crabbit,The laird, tho’ he’s wealthy, he’s Ijart and lean,lie’s auld, an’ he’s cauld, an’ he’s bliu’, an’ he’s baldAn’ he’s no for a lassie o’ merry eighteen.■But 0 there’s a laddie woo tells me he lo’es me.An’ him I lo’e dearly, aye, dearly as life,Tho’ father an’ mither should scold an’ abuse me,Nac ither shall ever gel me for a wife;Although he can boast na o’ land nor yet siller,lie’s worth to match w’’ a duchess or queen,For his heart is sae warm, an’ sae stately his form,An’ then, like mysel’ he’s just merry eighteen.

Crawford Bookseller*' 182/;.ROMAN CATHOLICCRUELTIES,A T a time when the Papists of Britain are m::k-itig vigorous and unwearied endeavours toprocure for themselves equal rights and privi¬leges with their heretical neighbours; it is re¬quisite that the latter should know the true char¬acter of the former t their conduct in past timestowards persons of their opinion at home andabroad; pad the probable use which would bemade of liberty by men, whose principles oncestimulated their forefathers, to perpetrate suchhorrid cruelties on their fellow creatures, underthe pretence of defending a religion, the authorof which, the Bible says, “ came to preach gladtidings to the meek, to bind up ttxe broken heart¬ed, to proclaim liberty 10 the captive, ami theopening of the prison to those that were bound.”How opposite to all these characteristics of ge¬nuine Christianity has been the conduct of Pap¬ists, tite pages ot this pamphlet will show.It is not for the purpose of heaping odium up¬on the persons of Papists now living, that thesebloody deeds are recited, but, to shew the neces¬sary tendency of their vhigious intolerance andbigotry. It is vatu, that persons calling them¬selves the friends of 'freedom asaefri that the in¬tolerant principfes of Papists .have changed, asthey have become t?hlightened. Pbpery is everthe same—or it is no longer the Roman Catholicreligion j—it cannot change without being at va-3riance with its oxni principles ;—for it maintainsits Popes infallible, and its faith unchanged, fromthe institution of Christianity to the present age.If Papists were bloody, cruel and deceitful, for¬merly—they say they never change—consequent¬ly, if they had power, their oath to extirpateheretics by all means, compels them to use therack, the scaffold, and the gibbet, again to spreaddesolation and blood over our now happy land.In one word, if the Pope and his conclave haveimbibed the tolerant spirit of tiie age, why areJesuits again tolerated and patronized ; and thecells of the Inquisition again yawning wide theirmurderous jaws, to swallow all that is noble andintellectual, and pious, in the degraded land ofSpain.The following pages have been compiled froma larger work, and gives a brief but faithful ac¬count, of a few of the Persecutions endured bvthe Churches of Christ, in different ages of theworld.I A Brief uvd true Account of the Cruelties and Persecutionscommitted by the Papists, upon the Waldensks andAlbigenbes. and other Protestants in Piedmont Suva//,and the Valtoline, from the year 1160, to the year 1CS6.( "yy hen, by the just judgment of the Almighty,“all the world wondered after the beast;’'rand the kings and princes of Christendom, estab-lilifhed the authority of the Pope and Church offiRome, appointing to slaughter and destructionu such as denied the horrid blashemies and errors(maintained by them: it occasioned many good,Christians to detest their superstitions, as un¬known to the Apostles and the primitive churchAnd the first we hear of, was one Berengarius,who boldly and faithfully published the true reli¬gion contained in the Scripture, and discoveredthe falseness of the Romish. He lived about thetime of William the Conqueror coming into Eng¬land, about which time his followers being takennotice of, as dissenting from many of the com¬mon received opinions of those times, they werebranded with the odious name of heretics.About twenty years after this, one Peter Bruiswas a famous preacher among them, and taughtthem publickly at Fholouse in havoy. In a shorttime after, they were grown to so great a multi¬tude, that the Popes of Rome were resolved, ifpossible, by any means, to extirpate and destroythem. To which end, they at first incited sev¬eral of the most learned of the r party to writeagainst them, and warned clivers princes, to havea care of them, and to banish them out of theirterritories.The first then that flung away the spititualkeys, and began valiantly 10 brandish the bloodysword of persecution against them, was PopeAlexander the 3rd, who began to hack, hew, andmurder the poor Waldens,es; so named, fromPeter Walgo, or Wildo, of Lyons in France,who appeared very courageous in opposing themany corruptions of the Romish Ctiurch:—as,holy oil—consecrated images—Popes’ indulgen¬ces—candles—merits-—auricular confession—thesupremacy of the Pope—fake miracles—Purga¬tory—praying for the dead—prayers to saints—extreme unction—and many other fopperies of5the Popish communion. This persecution ofWaldo and his followers, (who were increased toa very great number,) began in France in theyear 106.0. Waldo being compelled to fly intothe mountains of France, among the savage in-hubirants, to whom lie taught his doctrine; oth¬ers fled into Picardy, from whence they werecalled Picards; several into Funders and Adsatiatand thereby, for the safety of their own lives,they spread their doctrine into all places.King Philip of France, being incited by therclesiastics, raised arms against them, and destroy¬ed 300 gentlemen’s houses; and likewise wastedto,, ns. And those that fled to Flanders escapedlittle better: for they were persecuted, and manyof them for their religion put to death. Thebishops of Mayence and btrasburgh raised greatpersecution?, against those who fled timber, therebeing thirty-five citizens of Mayencc burned inone fire, and eighteen in another, who suffereddeath with great constancy. And at Strafburgh,at the instance of the bishop, fourscore were like¬wise burned for professing the same truth; andyet by the exhortations, constancy and patienceof these martyrs, there weie such multitudes whoentertained their doctrines, that in a few yearsafter, in the county of Passau and in Bohemia,there were above fourscore thousand persons thatmade profession of the same faith. Some of themlikewise fled into England for shelter, but weremore barbarously and cruelly put to death at Ox¬ford, by the Papists there, than over any Chus.tians were before that time, for maiters'of reli¬gion. Ihree years after, Pope Alexander the3rd, made a decree in the Council of Pours, in6France, that thesii Gospellers, and all their fa¬vourers, should be excommunicated; and thatnone of them should buy or sell, according as itwas foretold, in Revel xiii 17.One Giovanni, with his wife and child, werethrown down from a very high rock, the motherholding the child in her arms; and three daysafter they were found dead, but the child wasalive, and clasped so fist in the mother's arms,that they could hardly get it out. They took an¬other at the same place, and put out his eyes, ex¬posed him some time as a miseraDle spectacle;and he beintt yet alive, they flayed off his skin,and hung it in the windows of four principalhouses in Lucerne, after they had divided it intofou» pieces. They took out the brains of DanielGarden, and fryin : them in a pan, eat them uplike cannibals ; and' then cut open his breast also,that they might eat his heart, but were frightedby seme Protestant troops that were marchingthat war. They buiied four women between80 and 90 years old alive; they cut divers topieces, and gave their flesh to dog«. In anotherp1ace, having taken eleven Protestants, they heat¬ed ?. furnace, and forced them to throw one an¬other into it, till they came to the last mat:,whom they threw in themse'ves.They stabbed some vt ith poisoned knives in thelegs and feet, and so left them in torment tillthey died. One Gros, a minister's son, beingtaken by them, they cut off his flesh in smallgoblets while he was alive, and in the presenceof Ids wife and children, whom they murderedlikewise before his eyes. A woman with sevenchildren were ail barbarously murdered in their7beds. One Dank! R.unbout, because be reFusrdto say Jesu Maria, or prry to the Virgin Mary,they first cut off one finger, then another, tillthey had cut them all ciY. then they cut off Inshands and arms, till after this manner he wascruelly mangled to death. Others they shut upbetween two stone walls, and starved them todeath. And to conclude, there was no mannerof death, no kind of cruelty or torment, thatthese first born of hell could invent or devise, b itwere executed with the utmost severity upon thepoor miserable Protestants; and it aould be al¬most endless tw give a particular account of allthat were murdered, drowned, burned, shot,starved, smothered,, knocked on the head, andcut in pieces, by these barbarous Papists.ihese horrid and inhuman piacdces made therest of the Protestants fly to their arms, in thenatural defence of uiemsclves and their families,against the rage and fury of lions, tygers, andbears, in the shape of men. But those that wereso brisk at massacring and murdering such as didnot resist them, wrere mere cowards at fighting,and the Protestants prevailed against them withsmall numbers, and defended themselves againsttheir cruelty.But at last, by the mediation of the Switzers,Hollanders, and other Protestant Princes, andespecially the English, who contributed abovethiity thousand pounds to the relief of their wantsand miseries, the breach was made up ; but yetso made, that the poor remaining Protestants liveunder the tyrany of their Popish task-masters;being forbid ali manner of traffic, wronged oftheir estates aed goods, their ministers banished.8their virgins ravished, the women affronted, themen beaten and abused, and the vallies are be¬come the dungeons in which they are kept asslaves, and secured by strong forts and garrisonsof Papists; so that they are even dying whilethey live, and have cause to cry oat,—“Howlong, O Lord, holy and true, dost thou not judgeand avenge our blood," Rev. vt. 10.The Persecutions and Cruelties of the Papists upon the Fro-leslantsat Bohemia, Gi:kman y, Pox.AND^nrf Lithuania.r|,HE Persecutions of the Papists against (heBohemians began veiy early, even about 907years aLer the death of our blessed Saviour Pope Hddebrand (otherwise called Hellbrand,)was the fust that fed upon them, and afterwardsPope Celestine; and persecution continued uponthem for many years. John Huss, an 1 Jerome(d Prague, were burned in defence of the gos-pel, at Constance, noCwiihstamling they had thepublic faith cd the empire of Get many given themfor their security.In the year 1421, one Pichel, a chief magi¬strate of the city of Limeritis, having taken 24r f the chief citizens, and among them his son-in-l.iw, put them in an high tower, arid being therealmost famished, they were at last brought out,and condemned to be Irowned, their wives, chil¬dren, and friends, following them to executionwith cries and tears: yea, the magistrate’s owndaughter came with prayers and tears to her fa¬ther j beseeching him to spare her husband ; buthe, like a hard hearted wietch, said, ‘Cannot9you have a bc^er husband than this ?’ To whom,seeing his cruelty, she answered, ‘ You shallnever marry me to any but this.’ And so goingalong with them, when she saw her husbandthrown into the river, she leapt in after him, andembracing him, endeavoured to save his life; butbeing unable to do it, they both perished togeth¬erand the next day she was found with himfast in her arms, and they were both buried inone grave.Some Protestants were thrust into dungeonsand vaults full of snakes, toads, and ether filthyvermin: others were put into places full of ironspikes, so that they could neither sit nor stand ;they put gags into the mouths of some, and thenthrust their host or wafer cake down their throats.The city of Lesna, was one of the most an¬cient and flourishing «ities in all the kingdom ofPoland, which was wholly laid in ashes, beingthree whole days in flames before it was consum¬ed ; in which there perished many hundred Pio-testants. Here they pulled off the noses of some,and put out the eyes of others. They cut off thehands of a pious matron of Lesna, and then mur¬dered three of her children before her face. Another woman having her hands and feet cutoff, and her tongue cut out, they sowed up in asack, and left her for two days, in which she liv¬ed, makmg a most miserable lamentation.In the Lower Poland, one Mr. Samuel Cardus,a minister, they used with extreme cruelties, firstputting out his eyes, and leading him about as amiserable spectacle; then they pulled off his fing¬ers with pincers, and poured melted lead downhis throat; and while he was yet half alive, they10put hb neck between two folding doors, and soviolently severed his head from his body.7 he Persecutions and Cruelties of the Papists upon the Pro¬testants in France. With an account of the bloody Mas¬sacre in Paris.Jn the year 1524, one John Clark, set up a billon the church door, against the Pope’s par¬dons, and cahed him Antichrist ; for which be-ing apprehended, he was ordered to be whippedseveral days, and then burned in the forehead;his mother, a religious woman, standing by, en¬couraging h'in, saying, with a loud voice, *' Blessed be Christ, and welcome be these marks forhis sake.” ^fter this he went to Metz, and thereluting some images without the city, which thepeople used to worship once a-year; the eveningbefore, John Clark abhorring their idolatry, wentand brake down all their idols ; the next morning,when the clergy and people came to their wor¬ship, they found their images lying ali broken onthe ground, upon which there began a great tu¬mult, and John Clark was suspected and taken;who presently confessed the fact, and gave reas¬ons for hit. so doing, for which he was condemn-td to a most cruel death; his rignt hand was cutoff, then his nose was violently pulled off, andafter that his arms and breasts, with sharp pin¬cers, all which he sustained with admirable pa¬tience, uttering all the while the words of the11.5th Psalm. Lastly, he was thrown into thefire, and burnt to ashes.11A horrid massacre was committed on S^. FW-tbolomew’s dav, being the 24th of August, 1571,wfa’ch was the Sabbath day, and is made famousfor ever, by the effusion of so much precious in¬nocent blood, as no age nor time can parallel,for there were at this time in Paris, threescorethousand men, with pistols, poinards, swords,knives, and such other bloody instruments, whoran up and down, swearing and blaspheming thesacred majesty of God, cruelly massacring allthey met, so that the streets were covered withmangled bodies, and the gates and doors defiledwith blood ; the lords and gentlemen were inhu¬manly murdered, some in their beds, others onthe tops of their houses, and in all other placeswhere they were found ; and such a multitude ofdead bodies were thrown into the river Seine,that the water was dyed red with their blood.In the hellish assembly wherein this bloodymassacre was concluded on, it was there debated,whether the King of Navarre, and Prince ofConde, should not be destroyed with the rest ?the Duke of Guise pleaded for it, but otherswere against it, and argued how abominable irwould be to destroy two young princes of theblood, in the flower of their age, and one of themin the embraces of his young bride, and the king’sown sister; and therefore it was concluded, thatthey should be threatened violently with death,and all manner of torments, if they would notturn Papists.In this butcherly massacre at Paris, there wereabout four thousand houses robbed and plundered,and above five hundred barons, knights and gen¬tlemen, who were chief officers in the war; with12abundance of nolle young gentlemen, ladies andgentlewomen, inhumanly murdered, who littleexpected such ab’oady fate; for they came fromall parts to rejoice, in honour of the marriage ofthe King of Navarre v and instead of jollity andpleasures, they here met with an untimely deathfrom bloody and cowardly Papists, who murderlike devils, but dare not fight like men. In thatnight, and the two next days, there was slain inPans above ten thousand persons of both sexes,and all ranks and ages, the bloody Papists nocsparing the children in the cradle ; insomuch, thatthe streets, market-place, and rivers, were dyedwith oloori.I he king and his confidents fearing that thismassacre would net end the quarrel, but ratherstir up the Protestants in other places to standupen their owrn defence ; he therefore sends mes¬sengers by post to all parts of the kingdom, oftenshifting horses for more speed, with express com¬mands to the aovernors cf ail other townsand cities in France, to follow the example ofParis, and to destroy and kill all the Protes¬tants which were amongst them.As soon as the command was published, andthat the K.n'r’s letters came, the Papists fell withail im ginable fury upon dii the Protestants atIVleaux, Troys, Orleans, and other places, mur¬dering them without pity or compassion.'The Pope, when he first beam the news of themassacre, appointed a day of public thanksgivingto God, u here Te Deum was sung for joy in thechurch of St Lcuis. He likewise published aBull of pardons snd extraordinary* indulgence, tosuch as should pray for the heavenly assistance- 13to the kii>g and kingdom of France, for rootingout of heretics.At a to« n c Fed Sanray in France, in the year1593, one Marga'et Pieron was by her maid ac¬cused to the Jesuits for net going to Mass, andfor keeping a hible in her house, who complain¬ing thereof to tl e Judges: they ftnt for her, andsaid, Margaret, are you net willing to return hometo your house, and there enjoy your husband andchildren i Yes, said she. if it may stand withthe good will of God. t’hen, said they, if thouwilt do but a small matter thou shait be set atliberty. If, said she, it be not contrary to God’sglory, and my own salvation, you shall hear whatI will say to it. No such thing, said they, forail that we require is <* this, that a scaffold be¬ing set up in tt.e chiet ^art of the town, you shallthere crave pardon for offending the law, and afire being mace you shall burn your bible in itwithout speaking a won!. I pray you, my mas¬ters, said she, tell me is my bibie a good both orno? Yes, said they, we confess it is, only toplease the Jesuits we would have thee throw itin the fire; imagine it to be but paper, and thenyou may burn it, and tou may buy another atany time, and thereby you may secure ycur life.They spent two hrurs in persuading her that shemight commit a less evil to do a greater good.—■bhe conragiously answered them, that by the helpof God she would never do it. Will not thepeople say, said she, this Y a wretched womanindeed, that burns the bib.e, wherein all the ar¬ticles of the Christian religion are contained ? Iwill certainly burn my brdy rather than I willburn my bible. Upon this she was committed1*tfi prison, and fed only with bread and water,and her friends forbid to come to her, but con¬tinuing stedfast in the truth, she was thereuponcondemned to be set upon a scaffold, to have thebible burnt before her face, herself to he strangled,and her body to be dragged through the streetsto a dunghill ; which sentence she willingly andcheerfully underwenhIn the year 1550, one Faninus of Ferrara, inItaly, being by the grace of God, and reading ofgood books, converted to the gospel, and beganto instruct others privately therein; but this com¬ing to the ears of some of the Pope’s blood¬hounds, they seized him ani committed him toprison, where, by the earnest importunities of hiswife, children, and friend . he was persuaded todeny the truth, and was Hereupon released outof prison. He had not been long at liberty, tillhe was extremely troubled in mind, for prefer¬ring the love of his relations and friends beforethe service of Jesus Christ, neither could he byany means be free from these tortures till he hadfully resolved to venture his life for the gospel.Being thus inflamed with holy zeal, he wentabout the country teaching and instructing thepeople wherever he came. Whereupon he wasapprehended and cast into prison, and was con¬demned to be burnt, but he told his judges, thathis time was nor yet come, and so it happened,for he was removed Ferrara, where he con¬tinued in prison for two years, and afterwardseighteen months in another prison, and was againcondemned by the Pope’s Inquisitors, out still insdeath was one way or other prevented.His wife and sister came to him in prison, and15f.weeping ] itifuily, intreated him to remembeT andconsider his poor lami' y. To whom he ans vered,’That his Lord and master had commanded himmot to deny the truth for his family’s sake, and'that it was too much that for their sakes he hadtonce fallen already ; and therefore desired them■rot to solicit him any more in that matter, forhe knew his end drew near, and therefore he com¬manded them to the Lord. In a short time after,the Pope sent word Faninus should he burned,at which he verv much rejoiced, and thanked the(messenger. Being still offered life if he wouldrecant, and thereby prevent the misery of his(wife and children ■ he said, he would leave themI to a careful and sufficient Overseer, and beingasked who that was, he answered, even the LordJesus Christ, a faithful keeper of all that are com-[tnitted to him. Ashe was going to execution,one that saw him so merry and cheerful, askedhim what the reason of it was, since Jesus Christ| before his death swate water and Wood? lowhom he answered, that Chri«t sustained all thesorrow's and conflicts with he’d and death, whichwere due to vs, that by his sufferings we mightbe free from the sorrow and fear of them ail.—At the place of execution, after having earnestlypraved to God, he \vent paMently to the stake,and was first strangled, and then burned.The Persecutions find Cruellies of the Papists upon theProtestants in Sccti.and and, Iuklavd.As most kingdoms in Europe felt the rage andfury of Romish cruelty and persecution, soScotland, though in the frozen north, was not16insensible thereof; for in the year 157^, Mr.Patrick Hamilton, of an ancient and honourablefamily, and called Abbot of Fern, left Scotlandand went into Germany, where converting withLuiher and Melancthon, he greatly increased ingodly knowledge and learning, and returninghome he publicly preached concerning faith amigood works, and against the superstitions andidolatry of the Papists.This so enraged James Beaton, Archbishop ofSt. Andrews, that in the absence of the King,Mr. Hamilton was seized upon by the Bishop’sofficers, and carried to the castle, and the nextday he was brought forth to judgment, and con¬demned to be burned for the testimony of God.The articles charged against him, were aboutPilgrimage, Purgatory, Praying 10 Saints, andfor the Dead.'Nfttr dinner the fire was prepared, which somethought wa; only to terrify him, but it pleasedGod to strengthen him against the fear of death,and so he was tied to the stake. Giving his gar¬ments to his servant, and saying thus to him;These will not profit in the fire, they will profitthee; after this thou canst receive no benefit byme, except the example of my death, which Ipray thee to remember ; for though it be bitterto the flesh, and fearful before men, yet it is theentrance into eternal life, which none shall pos¬sess who deny Jesus Christ before this wickedgeneration. And the fire being kindled, he criedwith a load voice, Lord Jesus receive my spirit.How long shall darkness overwhelm this realm?And how long wilt thou suffer the tyranny offci these men ? A friar troubling him by crying out,17Turn thou heretic, call upon our lady, say SalveRegina, ike. He replied, Depart from me, andtrouble me not, thou messenger of Satan : andspeaking to one Campbell, the chief among them,he said, Wicked man, thou knowest the contrary,and hast confessed the contrary to me; I appealthee before the Tribunal Seat of Jesus Christ;after which words he resigned up his spirit toGod; and within a few days after the>friar diedin a freney and desperation.The Archbishop of St. Andrews likewise cal¬led before him two gentlemen, David Straton,and Mr. Kerman Gomlay. Mr. .Straton beingaccused for heresy was much ttoublcd at it, andthereupon frequented the company of leligiousmen; and heating that text read. He that deni-eth me before men, or is ashamed of me in thiswicked generation, 1 will deny him before myFather 'ind his Holy Angels; he stedfgstly liftedup his eyes and hands to heaven, and burst forthinto these words, O Lord I have been wicked,and justly mayest thou withdraw thy grace fromirK-, but Lord, for thy meicy sake, let me neverdeny thy truth for fear of death or corpora! pain.Being afterwards together with Mr. Normanbrought to judgment in Holy-Rood House, wherethe king h'mseif was present, they were bothcondemned to the fire, and in the afternoon werefirst hanged, and then burned, which they cheer¬fully suffered.There was likewise one Dean Thomas Foret,who used to } reach to his parishioners everyLord’s day, out cf the F.pistles and Gospels, asthey came in order, for which being complainedof to the Bishop of Duukeldon. he reproved him18for it, teliing him that it was too much to preachevery Sunday, since the people might think theyought to do so likewise ; and said the Bishop, Isit not enough for you when you find a goodEpistle and Gospel, to set forth and preach theliberty of the Holy Church, and let the rest alone.D can Thomas replied, that he hid read their, allover, and knew no bad ones among them ; bu*,said he, when your lordship shews me any suchI will pass them by The Bishop answered, Ithank God I never knew what the Old and NewTestament was; but go your ways and repent ofthese fancies ere it be too late. Tire Dean an¬swered, My cause is good and just in the pre¬sence of God, and therefore I care not what fol¬lows thereupon, and so went away, but he wasshortly after sent for before Cardinal Beaton, bywhom he was condemned and burned for an he¬retic.The year after, Jerome Russel, and AlexanderKennedy, who was ndf above eighteen years old,were brought before the Archbiohop and his as¬sociates, who railed upon them, and called themheretics. Jerome Russel replied, This is yourhour and power of darkness, now sit ye as judges,and we are wrongful!)' accused, but the day willcome, wherein our innocency will appear, andye shall see your own blindness to your everlast¬ing confusion ; go forward amt fulfil the measureof your iniquity. A while after they were sen¬tenced to die, and as they went to execution,Jerome comforted Kennedy, saying, Brother,fear not, greater is he that is in us than he thatis in the world ; the pain we are to suffer is short,and shall be light, but our joy and consolation19fLall never have an end ; let us therefore strive toenter into our Master and Saviour's joy, by thesame straight way which he hath taken before us;death cannot hurt us, for it is destroyed by himfor whose sake we now suffer. And in this man¬ner they joyfully gave up their souls to Ged inthe flaming fire.In the year 1543, Cardinal Beaton'coming toEdinburgh, caused several religious persons to bebrought before him, and when he could provenothing else against them, he caused fo«r men tobe hanged upon suspicion that ttrey had eatena goose upon a Friday. And a woman, with achild sucking at her breast, was drowned for re¬fusing to pray to the Virgin Mary. Many otherswere likewise banished, and imprisoned fer thegospel; and among the rest John Rogers, aleariivd and godly minister, whom he caused tobe murdered in prison, and then thrown over thewall, giving it out, that by attempting to makehis.escape he broke his neck.In the year 1546, Mr. George Wishart, &famous minister, was sent for to appear beforeCoTdinal Beaton, and the oilier Bishops at St.Andrews; where a Priest was ordered to cursehim, who Called him runnagnte, traitor, thief,&c. Honoured Mr. V\rh,hart gave them an ac¬count of his iaith and doctrine, but they not be¬ing able to answer h’m, immediately condemnedhim to be burned ; and presently a fire v.'as pre¬pared over against the casile, and velvet cushionswere laid in the c istle windows for the Cardinaland the test of the Prelates to see him auffer;and ior tear he should be rescued by his friends,'all the castle guns were mounted against the place20of his execntion, by the Cardinal’s order; thenwith a rope about his neck, and a chain about hismiddle, he was fastened to the stake, and hav¬ing earnestly praved, and exhorted the people,and forgiven his enemies and persecutors, he saidthus: 1 beseech you, biethren, exhort your pre¬lates to learn the Word of God, that they maybe ashamed to do evil, and learn to do good, orelse there shall come upon them the wrath ofGod, which they shall not eschew. Then thehangman upon his knees said, Sir, I pray forgiveme, for I am not the cause ot your death. Mr.Wishart called him to him, and kissing hischeek, said, Lo, heie is a token that I forgivethee, my heart do thine office ; and so he wastied to the stake, and the fire kindled.The captain ef the castle came to him and hidhim be of <n>od courage; to whom Mr. Wishartsaid, This fire torments my body, but no whitabates my spirits; then looking towards the Car¬dinal, he said, He who in such state, from thathigh place, feeds his eyes with my torments,within few days shall be hanged out at the samewindow, with as much shame and ignominy ashe there leans with pride: then his breath beingstopt with the flames he gave up the ghost.This prophecy was fulfilled in a short timeafter ; for the people being generally discontentedat the cruelty used against Mr. Wishart, severalpersons conspired against him, a*id killed him inthe castle, and the provost raising the town, cameto the castle gates, crying, What have you donewith my Lord Cardinal i* Where is lie!) Towhom they answered from within, Return to yourhouses, for he hath received Lis reward, and will21trouble the world no more. But they cried, Wewill never depart till we see tiim. Then was hehanged out at that very window to satisfy themhe was dead, and so the people departed.Shortly after, one Adam Waiiace was burnedlikewise j and Henry Forest suffered the samecruel death, upon account of heresy. OneWalter Mill was accused for heresy, and beingbid to recant, he said, I am corn, and not chaff,I will not recant the truth and being thereuponcondemned to the fire, and all things made readyto that purpose, they commanded him to go tothe stake. No, said he, by the hws of God kam lorbii;den to lay hands on myself, thereforedo you put me in the fire, and you shall see myresolufion. Having then made his prayer untoGcd, he spake thus to the people; Although Ihave been a great sinner, yet it is not for that,but for God’s truth, contained in his Word ofthe Old and New lestaments, that 1 now suff r;and God, out of Ins abundant mercv, doth hon¬our me »o far, as to make me among other of hisservants, seal his truth with my blood. After hehad thus spoke, he was tied to the st.ke, and thefire being kindled, he quiet y slept in rhe Lord ;and was the last person that died for the P;otes-tant religion in Scotland.In the year oi our Lord, there brakefoith a most horrid and bloody rebellion and mas¬sacre, co emitted by the Irish Papists on the Eng¬lish, m Ireland ; a nation, famous for the birihof many worthy persons-, especially, that learnedand religious person, James Usher, late Arch¬bishop of Armagh, and Primate of Ireland ; who,amongst many other gifts and graces, was endued22v/ith a spirit of prophecy; from which, amongother things, he foretold the bloody rebellion,forty years before it came to pass, which predic¬tion proved exactly true.The Jesuits, Priests and Friars were the chiefinstigators to this horrid massacre, by continualincensing and stirring up the Popish gentry andcommomlty. The clergy, more to engage thedeluded Papists to murder the Protestants, everywhere loudly declaimed. That they were here¬tics, and not fir to be suffered any longer amongthem ; that it was no more sin to kill one ofthem, than to kill a dog; and that it was an un¬pardonable sin to relieve or protect them.All things being in readiness, they proceeded’to the execution of this damnable contrivance;but their proceeding therein was various : someof the Irish only stripping the Enudish Protestants,and turning them out of doors naked in frost andenow ; others, cruelly murdering, man, woman,and child, without the least compassion. ThePopish Priests gave the sacrament to divers of theIrish, upon condition that they should not spareany Protestant; saying, ‘ i hat it did them a greatdeal of good, to wash their hands in their blood.’The Priests excommunicated ail that should re¬lieve or harbour any Protestant. Yea, the Monksand Friars, with tears in their eyes, exhortedthem to destroy them utterly, and not to leavethe memorial of a Protestant under heaven.L'he day before th s horrid massacre began,the Priests gave the people a dismission at mass,to go out and take possession of all their lands.They further told them, that they might lawfullystrip, rob, and despoil them of all their property,r23the Protestants being worse than dogs; that thekilling of such was meritorious, and an excellentpreservative against the pains of Purgatory.At the comtvencement of this horrid rebellion,several Irish gentlemen pretended great kindnessto some of their Protestant neighbours and per¬suaded them to put their good? and cattle intotheir hands, in order to secure them from therage of the rabble ; because of former familiarity,the Protestants gave them inventories of all theyhad •, nay, they digged up some of their bestthings which they had hidden in the ground, andput them into the Papists’ hands; by this meansthey gained vast quantities of goods, and like truePapists cheated them out of them all.In one place there were no less than tw cnty-two widows, who were first robbed, and thenstripped statk nakr>d; they covered themselveswith str^w in a house, but the bloody Papiststhrew in burning straw among them, on purposeto burn them together.In the castle of ibsgol above an hunched andtwenty men, women, and children, were burnedtogether. Another castle was delivered to one ofthe Popish commanders, upon condition theirlives should be ^ved. hut as soon as he enteredhe cruedy murdered and destroyed them all with¬out mercy. And at Portendown Bridge a thou¬sand men. women, and children, were drownedin the river.In Queen’s county an Englishman, his wife,five children, and a maid, were all hanged to¬gether, and then cut down, and put into a hole;the youngest child, though it was hanged, wasnot quite dead when it was put in, but put up its24hand ^nd cried, Mammy, mammy, and yet the»eviilains without mercy buried it alive.They stripped a Scotchman, and knocked himdown for dead, but he afterwards recovering, wentinto the town naked, whereupon they hewed hima’ti to pieces. They also ripped up-his wife’sbelly, so that the child dropped out. They like¬wise hanged up divers other women with child,and ripping them up, gave the infants to be de¬voured by dogs and swine.In one piace they burned two English Bibles,and said it was heli fire they burned. A Papistwould have persuaded a man and his wife to havejoined with them in the massacre ■, but they pro¬tested, That rather than they would forsake theirreligion, they would die upon the sword’s point;whereupon they were both cruelly murdered.These barbarous villains caused some childrento carry their aged parents to the rivtr, and drounthem: some wares were forced to help to hangtheir husbands •, and in one to wn they caused ayoung man to murder his own tathei, and thenhanged him up In another place ihey forced awoman to kill h.-r husband, then earned the sonto kill Lis mother, and then immediately hangedthe sonBy these, and all manner of cruelties whichhell itself Could invent, the Irish and EnglishPapists murdered and destroyed, in a few months,near three hundred thousand Protestants, as it iscommer.ly computed, without any manner of pro¬vocation, but only because they were Protestants;whose deaths the Divine vengeance recompensedupon the chief murderers, many thousands perish¬ing by the sword and the plague.FINIS.

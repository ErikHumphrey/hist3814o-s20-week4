but since it is thus.My money once more I will put in my purse.And, as I’m her father, I solemnly swear,i’ll keep both vny money and Tib the grey mare.The money soon vanished out of his sight.And so did young Katie, his joy and delight.And he, like a blockhead, turned out of doorsForbidding him ever to come any more.A' oung Rodger began his locks for to tear,And wish he had never stood for the grey marc.But five days thereafter, or little above,He chanc’d to meet with young Katie his love,He said lovely creature, do you not know me ?If I’m not mistaken, I’ve seen you, said she,Or one in your likeness, with long yellow hairWho came a-courting my father’s grey mare !No, no, it was you that a-courting I came.As sure as your beautiful Katie by name.I know, says she, you need not deny’t,For the truth of the matter was very well try’t.And unto my father you sctemnly sware,That you’d not wed me without the grey mare.I must needs acknowledge I would had both.That whiles for pleasure we might have rode,4Not thinking that he would have any dispute.In giving his daughter the grey mare to boot,Before he had lost such a dutiful son.But now I am sorry for what I have done.I'm not sorry, says Kate, I value you not,There is plenty of men in the world to get.Surely the man must be at his last prayer,Who’d marry a wife for the sake of a mare,The price thereof it was not very great;Now fare you well Roger, go mourn for Kate.O LET ME IN THIS AE NIGHT.0 LASSIE, art thou sleeping yet ?Or art thou wauken I would wit ?For love has bound me hand and fit,And I wad fain be in jo.O let me in this ae night.This ae ae ae night,For pity’s sake, this ae night;O wad ye let me in jo.Out o’er the moss, out o’er the muir1 came, this dark and dreary hour,And here I stand without the door.Amid the pouring storm, jo.O let me, &c.Thou hear’st the winter wind and weet,Nae star blinks thro’ the driving sleet,Tak pity on my weary feet,And shield me frae the rain, jo.O let me, &c.The bitter blast that round me blaws,Unheeded howls, unheeded fa’sThe cauldness o’ my feet’s the causeO’ a’ my grief an’ pain, jo.0 let me, &c.HER ANSWER.O TELL nae me of wind and rain,Upbraid na me wi’ cauld disdain,, Gae back the gate you cam again,| I winna let you in, jo.I tell you now' this ae night,This ae ae ae night;And ance for a’ this ae night;1 wdnna let you in, jo.The snellest blast, at mirkest hours,That round the pathless wand’rer pours,Is nought to what poor she endures,That’s trusted faithless man, jo.I tell you now, &c.6The sweetest flower that deck'd the mead,Now trodden like the vilest weed :Let simple maids the lesson read,The weird may be her ain, jo.I tell you now, &c.The bird that charm’d his summer day,Is now the cruel fowler’s prey ;Let witless, trusting woman say,How aft her fate’s the same, jo.I tell you, now, &c.CLUTHA’S BONNIE LASSIE.HAVE ye seen in the calm dewy morning.The red-breast wild warbling sac clear ;Or the low-dwelling snow-breasted gowan,Surcharg’d wi’ mild e’ening’s soft tear :O, then ye hae seen my dear lassie,The lassie I lo’e best of a’;But far frae.the hame o’ my lassieI’m mony a lang mile awa’.Her hair is the wing o’ the blackbird,Her eye is the eye o’ the dove,Her lips are the ripe-bluohing rose-bud.Her bosom’s the palace of love.fjno' green be thy banks, 0 sweet Clutha !(Thy beauties ne’er charm me ava;irgive me, ye maids o’ sweet Clutha,j My heart is wi’ her that’s awa’.j love, thou’rt a dear fleeting pleasure !I The sweetest we. mortals here know,tut soon is thy heav’n, bright beaming,1 O’ercast wi’ the darkness of woe.as the moon, on the oft-changing ocean,i Delights the lone mariner’s eye,•pill red rush the storms of the desart,And dark bllows tumble on high,MARTS DEPARTED SHADE.THOU Ung’rmg star, with less’nihg ray,Thou lov’st to greet the early morn,Again thou usher’st in the dayMy Mary from my soul was torn.O Mary, dear departed shade !Where is thy place of blissful rest ?Seest thou thy lover lowly laid ?Hear’st thou the groans that rend his breast ?That sacred hour can I forget ?Can I forget the hallow’d grove ?8Where, by the winding Ayr, we metTo live one day of parting love.Eternity cannot effaceThose records dear of transports past;Thy image at our last embrace,Ah, little thought we ’twas our last.Ayr gurgling kiss’d its pebbl’d shore,O’erhung with wild woods thick’ning green \The fragrant birch and hawthorn hoar,Twin’d am’rous round the raptur’d scene.The flowers sprang wanton to be prest,The birds sang love on every spray,Till too, too soon the glowing westProclaim’d the speed of winged day.Still o’er these scenes my mem’ry wakes,And fondly broods with miser-care ;Time but th' impression stronger makes,As streams their channels deeper wear :My Mary, dear departed shade,Where is thy place of blissful rest ?Seest thou thy lover lowly laid ?Hear’st thou the groans that rend his breast tFINIS.

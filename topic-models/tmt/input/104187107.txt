ERIN.There came to the beach a poor exile of Erin,The dew on his thin robe was heavy and chill,For his country he sigh’d, when at twilight repairinTo wander alone by the wind-beaten hill.But the day-star attracted his eyes’ sad devotion.For it rose on his own native isle of the ocean,Where once in the flow of his youthful emotion,He sung the bold anthem of Erin go bragh.O sad is my fate, said the heart-broken stranger,The wild deer and wolf to a covert can flee ;But I have no refuge from famine and danger,A home and a country remains not for me.Ah, never again in the green shady bowers,Where my forefathers liv’d, shall I spend the swe.hours,Or cover my harp with the wild-woven flowers,And strike the sweet numbers of Erin go bragh.But yet all its fond recollections suppressing,One dying wish my fond bosom shall draw,Erin, an exile bequeaths thee his blessing,Land of my forefathers—Erin go bragh.Buried and cold, when my heart stills its motion.Green be thy fields, sweetest isle of the ocean.And thy harp-striking bards sing aloud with devotionErin mavourneen, Erin go bragh.3JIM CROW’S TRIP TO GREENWICH.It was de oder Sunday morning,1 put on my dandy coat;And went down to GreenwichOn board de great steam-boat.Wheel about, &c.We hab folks of eb’ry nation.All languages dey peak ;From de Yankee, Swiss, Garman,Down to ancient Dutch Greek.Wheel about, &c.One gemman ax de Captain’Fore de fastenings were clare.How much furder is it, Captain,Now, before well be there.Wheel about, &c.Dare was a Frenchman told de Captain,He want git out on de Railroad,’Kase he really was afeart de boatWould tumble overboard.Wheel about, &c.But a very cunning chap on board,Know’d eb’ry ting, it seem ;Undertook to tell a ladyHow de Ingine mov’d by steam.Wheel about, &c.4He says, first you see dis ere tingThat’s going up and down ;Well den, you see dem cart wheelsTurning round and round.Wheel about, &c.Well den, you see dem oder tings,Look like a pair ob tongs,Dey hits against dese oder tings.And shoves do boat along.Wheel about, &c.And when dey want to steer de boat,And bring her round in time,Dare’s a ting looks like a cellar door,Swinging on behind.Wheel about, &c.MY HITHER MEN’T MY AULD BREEKSEy mither men’t my auld breeks,And oh but they were duddy.She sent me to get shod the mare,At Robin Tamson’s smiddy.The smiddy stands beside the burnThat wimples through the clachan ;And there’s no a time that I gang by,But what I fa’ a laughing.CHORUS.With my fal de dal de didot,Lai de do a daddy, o,Fol de do a daddy, o.«*Robin Tamson was a wealthy carl,And had a bonny dochter,He would not let her take a man,Though mony a anc had sought her.And what think ye o’ my exploit,The time the mare was shoeingI stepped up unto the lass.And briskly fell a-wooing.And aye she e’ed my auld breeksThe time that we were crackin’,Says I, my lass, ne’er mind the clouts,I have new anes for the making.But gin that ye take my advice.And leave the carle your father,Ye’se get my breeks to keep in trim,Mysel’ and a’ thegither.Your offer’s fair, I’m very sure,I really think I’ll take it;Quo’ I, my lad, get out the mare,We’ll baith get on the back o’t.For gin I wait thy father’s time,I’d wait till I was fifty,But now I’ll marry in my prime,And make a wife so thrifty.Robin Tamson was an angry manFor the losing o’ his daughter,And throughout the hale country side he ran,And far and near he sought her.And when he came to our fire-end.And got us baith thegither,6Quo’ I my lad I’ve taen your bairn,And you may take my mither.Auld Robin girn’t, and shook bis neive,Good sooth, quo’ he, you’re merry ;I think I’ll tak’ you at your word,And end this hurry burry.Now Robin and our auld guidwifeHave drawn their legs thegither.And I’ve ta’en Robin Tamson’s pet.And Robin’s got my mither.LASH TO THE HELM.In storms when clouds obscure the sky,And thunders roll, and lightnings fly ;In midst of all these dire alarms,I think my Sally in my arms.The troubled main.The wind and rainMy ardent passion prove ;Lash’d to the helm.Should seas overwhelm,I’d think then on thee, my love.When rocks appear on every side.And art is vain the ship to guide,In varied shapes when death appears,The thoughts of thee my bosom cheers.Lash to the helm,Should seas overwhelm,I’d think on thee, my love.7But should the gracious powers be kind.Dispel the gloom, and still the wind,And waft me to thy arms once more,Safe to my long lost native shore ;And then with theeI’d happy be,And think on nought but love.BRAES O’ BIRXIEBOUZLE.Will ye gang wi’ me, lassie,To the braes o’ Birniebouzle ?Baith the earth and sea, lassie,Will I rob to fend ye.I’ll hunt the otter and the brook,The hart, the hare, the heather-cock ;And pu’ the limpet aff the rock,To fatten and to fend ye.If ye gang wi’ me, lassie,To the braes o’ Birnicbouzle,Till the day ye die, lassie.Ye shall ay ha’e plenty ;The peats I’ll carry in a skull,The cod and ling wi’ lines I’ll pull.An’ reave the eggs o’ mony a gull,To make you dishes dainty,Sae cheery will ye be, lassie,I’ the braes o’ Birniebouzle ;Donald Gunn and me, lassie, .Ever will attend ye.8Though \v< hae neither milk nor meal,Nor lamb, nor mutton, beef, nor veal,We’ll fang the porpy and the seal,And that’s the way to fend ye.And ye shall gang sae braw, lassie,At the kirk o’ Birniebouzle,Wi’ littet brogues, an’ a’, lassie,Wow, but ye’ll be vaunty.And ye shall wear, when ye arc wed,The kirtle and the Highland plaid,And sleep upon a heather bed,•Sae cosie and sae canty.*/If ye shall marry me, laddie.At the kirk o’ Birniebouzle,My chiefest aim shall be, laddie,Ever to content ye.I’ll bait the line, and bear the pail,And row the boat, and spread the sail.And dad the clotters wi’ a flail,To mak’ our ’taties dainty.Then come awa wi’ me, lassie,To the braes o’ Birniebouzle,And since ye are sae free, lassie,Ye never shall repent ye.For ye shall hae baitli tups and ewes,And gaits, and swine, and slots, and cowsAnd be the lady o’ my house,And this may weel content ye.

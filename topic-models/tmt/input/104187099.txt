bonnie lassie,Gi’e her a kiss and let her gae.But if ye meet a dirty hussy,Fy gar rub her o'er with strae.Be sure ye diuna quat the gripOf ilka joy, when ye are young,Before old age your vitals nip,And lay you twa-fold o’er a rung.GSweet youth, a blythe and heartsome time,Then lads and lasses, while ’tis May,Gae pu’ the gowan in its prime,Before it wither and decay.Watch the soft minutes of delight,When Jenny speaks beneath her breath,And as she’s laying a’ the wyteOn you, as if she kept ony sketh.Haith, ye’re ill-bred, she’ll smiling say,Ye’ll worry me, ye greedy rook ;Syne from you she’ll rin away,And hide herself in some dark nook.Her laugh will lead you to the placeWhere lies the happiness ye want,And plainly tell ye to your face.Nineteen nae says are half a grant.Now to her heaving bosom cling,And sweetly toolie for a kiss ;Frae her fair finger whoop a ring.As token of a future bliss.These benisons, I’m very sure,Are of the gods’ indulgent grant;Then surely, carle, whisht, forbearTo plague us with your whining cant.BANKS OF ALLAN WATER.On the banks of Allan Water,When the sweet spring time did fall,Was the Miller’s lovely daughter,Fairest of them all.(For liis bride a soldier sought her.And a winning tongue had he :On the banks of Allan water,Xone so gay as she.On the banks of Allan water,When brown autumn spreads its store.There I saw the Miller’s daughter ;But she smil’d no more.For the summer grief had brought he",And her soldier false was he ;On the banks of Allan water,None so sad as she.On the banks of Allan water.When the winter snow fell fast.Still was seen the Miller’s daughter.Chilling blew the blast.But the Miller’s lovely daughter,Both from cold and care was free—On the banks of Allan water,There a corpse lay she!MY BOY TAMMY,Whare ha’e ye been a’ day, my boy Tammy?I’ve been by burn and flowery brae.Meadow green and mountain grey,Courting o’ this young thing, ,Just come frae her mammy.And whare gat ye that young thing, my boy Tammy ?1 gat her down in yonder howe.8Smiling on a broomy luiowe,Herding ae wee lamb and eweFor her poor mammy.What said ye to the bonny bairn, my boy Tammy ?I prais’d her een, sae lovely blue,Her dimpl’d cheek, and cherry mou’;I pree’d it aft, as ye may true!—She said, she’d tell her mammy.I held her to my beating heart, my young, my smilinglammie!I ha’e a house, it cost me dear,I’ve walth o’ plenishin’ and gear ;Ye’se get it a' war’t ten times mair,Gin ye will leave your mammy.The smile gaed aff her bonnie face—I maunna leavemy mammy ; ^She’s gi’en me meat, she’s gi’en me claise.She’s been my comfort a’ my days :My father’s death brought monie waes—I canna leave my mammy.We’ll tak’ her hame and mak’ her fain, my ain kindhearted lammie!We’ll gi’e her meat, we’ll gi’e her claise,We’ll be her comfort a’ her days,The wee thing gi’es her hand, and says—There! gang and ask my mammy.Has she been to the kirk wi’ thee, my boy Tammy ?She has been to the kirk wi’ me,And the tear was in her e’e,—But O! she’s but a young thing.Just come frae her mammy.

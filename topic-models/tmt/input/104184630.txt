I’ll do that thing,”And clapp’d his thumb upon her money !Jimlet eye—sausage-nose—Pat so sly, ogle throws.Leering, timing, fritt’ring ;Sweet Widow Leary *AH the sweet faces, &c.When Pat had thus his fortune made.He pressed the lips of Mrs Leary;And mounting straight a large cockadeTIn captain’s boots struts' Paddy Carey !He grateful prais'd her shape, her back,To others like a dromedary ;Her eyes, that seem’d their strings to crack.Were Cupid’s darts to Captain Carey !Nate and sweet—no alloy—all complete—love andj°y»Ranting, roaring, soft adoring,Dear Widow Leary;All the sweet faces at Lim’rick races.From Mullinavat to Magherafelt;At Paddy’s promotion sigh and melt;The sowls ail cry, as the groom struts by,“ Och ! cushlamacree, thou art l6st to me.The joily boy, the darling .boy!The lady’s toy, the widow's joy !f'4Long sword-girted, neat short-skirted, head crept,whisker-chopp’d, Captain Carey !O sweet Paddy!Beautiful Paddy!White-feathered, boot-leathered, Paddy Carey !Rlack-ey d Susan.All in the Downs the fleet was moor’d,w/u he streamers waving in the wind.When black ey’d Susan came on board ;Oh ! where shall I my true love find ?I ell me, ye jovial sailors, tell me true.Does my sweet William sail among your crew?William, then high upon the yard.Rock’d by the billows to and fro.Soon as her well-known voice he heard.He sigh’d, and cast his eyes below:he cord glides swiftly thro’ his glowing hands.And quick as lightning on the deck he stands.So the sweet lark, high pois'd in air.Shuts close his pinions on his breast.If chance his mate’s shrill cry he hear.And drops at once into her nest :The noblest captain in the British fleetMight envy William’s lips those kisses sweet.O Susan, Susan, lovely dear,My vows shall ever true remain ;Let me kiss off that falling tear.We pnly part to meet, again .-Change as ye list, ye winds, my heart shall beThe faithful compass, that still points to thee.Believe not what the landsmen say.Who tempt with doubts thy constant mind ;5They’ll tell thee, sailors, when away.In every port a mistress find !Yes, yes, believe them when they^tell thee so.For thou art present wheresoe’er I go.If to far India’s coast we sail.Thine eyes are seefi in diamonds bright.Thy breath is Afric’s spicy gale.Thy skin is ivory so white ;Thus ev’ry beauteous object that I view.Wakes in my soul some charm of lovely Sue.Tho’ battle calls me from thy arms.Let not my pretty Susan mourn ;Tho’ cannons roar, yet, safe from harm,William shall to his dear return:Love turns aside the balls that round me fly.Lest precious tears should drop from Susan’s eyeThe boatswain gave the dreadful word.The sails their swelling bosoms spread.No longer must she stay on board.They kiss'd, she sigh’d, he hung his head ;Her less’ning boat, unwilling, rojws to land.Adieu, she cries, and wav'd her lily hand.Midnight Bowl.Care, thou canker of all joys.Now the tyrant’s reign is o’er;Fill the merry bowl, my boys.Join in Bacchanalian roar.O’er the merry midnight bowl,O how happy we will be;Day was made for vulgar souls.Night, my boys, for you and me.6Seize the villian, plunge him in!See the hated miscreant dies !Mirth, with all thy train, come in ;Banish sorrow, tears, and sighs.O’er the merry, &c.Tullochgorum.Come, gie's a sang, the lady cried.And lay your disputes all aside ;W hat nonsense is't for folks to chideFor what’s been done before them.Let whig and tory all agree.Whig and tory,Whig and tory,Whig and tory all agreeTo drop their whigmegmorum.Let whig and tory all agreeTo spend the night wi’ mirth and glee.And cheerfu’ sing alang wi’ meThe reel of Tullochgorum.Tullochgorum’s my delight.It gars us a’ in ane unite.And ony sumph that keeps up spite.In conscience I abhor him :Blythe and merry we’s be a’,Blythe, &c.Blithe and merry we’s be a’.To make a cheerfu’ quorum ;Blithe and merry we’s be a’As lang as we hae breath to draw.And dance till we be like to fa’.The Reel of Tullochgorum.There needs nae be sae great a phraseWi’ bringing dull Italian lays ;I wadna gie our ain strathspeysFor hauf a bunder score o’m.7They’re dowff and dowie at the best,Dowff, Arc.They’re dowfF and dowie at the best,Wi’ a’ their variorum :They’re dowff and dowie at the best.Their allegros, and a’ the rest,^hey canna please a Highland taste.Compar’d wi’ Tullochgorum.Let warldly minds themselves oppress,Wi’ fear o’ want, and double cess.And silly sauls themselves distress,Wi’ keeping up decorum.Shall we sae sour and sulky sit.Sour, &c.Shall we sae sour and sulky sit.Like auld Philosophorum ?Shall we sae sour and sulky sit,Wi’ neither sense, nor mirth, nor wit.And canna rise to shake a fitTo the reel of Tullochgorum ?May choicest blessings still attendEach honest-hearted open friend.And calm and quiet be his end.Be a’ that’s gude before him !May peace ar^l plenty be his lot.Peace, &c.May peace and plenty be his lot.And dainties a great store o’m :May peace and plenty be his lot,Lnstain'd by ony vicious blot!And may he never want a groat.That’s fond of Tullochgorum.But for the discontented fool,Wha wants to be oppression’s tool.May envy gnaw his rotten soul.And blackest fiends devour him !8 ■May dole and sorrow be his chance,Dole, &c. »May dole and sorrow be his chance.And honest souls abhor him :May dole and sorrow be his chance.And a’ the ills that come frae France,Whae’er he be that winna danceThe reel o’ Tullochgoruna.W/ien ’tis Night.V\ hen ’tis night, and the mid-watch is come.And chilling mists hang o’er the darken’d main.Then sailors think of their far distant home.And of those friends they ne’er may see again.But when the fight’s begun.Each serving at his gun.Should any thought of them come o’er our mind.We think, but should the day be won.How ’twill cheerTheir hearts to hear.That their old companion he was one !Or, my lad, if you a mistress kindHave left on shore, some pretty girl and true,Who many a night doth listen, to the wind.And sighs to think how it may fare with youOh, when the fight’s begun.Each serving at his gun,Should any thought of her come o’er your mind>Think only should the day be won.How t’will cheer.Her heart to hear.That her own true sailor he was one.FINIS.

He was a considerable landed proprie-ror, who passed the greater pai't of hrs time onlis estate, and who, froth his knowledge of farm •ing, cattle-breeding, and the cultivation of the vine,(had been enabled not only to 'turn his property togood account, but to obtain great influence in thejutiween four and five o’clock, the siesta, orjafternoon nap, being over, our friends, rubbingtheir eyes, gradually made their appearance ; by(half past five, we were all assembled. The careta,which is merely a covered cart, and well suppliedwith mats and straw in place of springs, was or¬dered for the ladies, who set out to pay What theyiwere pleased to call “ gossiping country visits.”1. he gentlemen rode in another direction to see:he cattle selected for next day’s Matanza orslaughter. We were guided, by a cloud of dust,m the spot where the country people had collectedthe drove, and hemmed them into a corner. Themaster of the house, accompanied by the principalhorseman of his fat m, rode amongst the beasts, and(fixing Ids eye upon the fattest, pointed it out to theattendants, who soon separated it, by means ofitheir goads, From the rest. In this Way fifteenwere selected, and being surrounded by about aSouth America.4THE MONTHLY 'dozen Ijorsemen, were driven slowly towards tiehouse* and finally into an adjoining Corrai irinclosure.On our way homeward our host entertaineds,by making his people shew us the South AifiS-can method of catching cattle. The instru ’ntused is called in English a Lasso, from the Stil¬ish Lazo, which signifies slip-knot or noose, xlthe operation of using it is called Lassoing, .itconsists of a rope made of strips of untanned is,varying in length from fifteen to twenty yards, miis about as thick as the little finger, it has a n eeor running-knot at one end, the other extrelitpbeing fastened by an eye and button to a ringjiiastrong hide-belt or surcingle, bound tightly it rdthe horse. The coil is grasped by the horsem j sleft hand, while the noose, which is held in heright, trails along the ground, except when in in,and then it is whirled round the head with ih-siderable velocity, during which, by a peer a.turn of the wrist, it is made to assume a circmcform ; so that, when delivered from the hand, benoose preserves itself open till it falls over the bject at which it has been aimed.The unerring precision with which the las; asthrown is perfectly astonishing, and to one sosees it for the first time, has a very magical p-pearauce. Even when standing still it is by)means an easy thing to throw the lasso j but ledifficulty is vastly increased when it comes tc;xused on horseback and at a gallop, and when inaddition, the rider has to pass over uneven grociand to leap hedges and ditches in his course j etsuch is the dexterity of the guassos, or countrymen,that they are not only sure of catching the animalthey are in chase of, but can fix, or, as they term,it, place their lasso on any particular part theyplease : over the horns, round the neck, or thebody; or they can include all four legs, or two,. or any one of the four ; and the whole with such^ ease and certainty, that it is necessary to witnessfll the feat to have a just conception of the skill dis-. played ; which, like that of the savage Indian inthe use of his bow and arrow, can only be gainedby the practice of many years. It is, in fact, theearliest amusement of these people ; and I havei* often seen little boys just beginning to run about,>• actively employed in lassoing cats, and entanglingthe legs of every dog that was unfortunate enoughi to pass within reach : in due season they becamei very expert in their attacks on poultry ; and after¬wards in catching wild birds ; so that, by the timethey are mounted on horseback, which is always; at an early age, they begin to acquire that match-; less skill, from which no animal, of less speed thant a horse, has the slightest chance of escaping.Let us suppose that a wild bull is to be caught,and that two mounted horsemen, guassos as theyare called, undertake to kill him. As soon asthey discover him, they remove the coil of thelasso from behind them, and, grasping it in theleft hand, prepare the noose in the right, and dashoft at full gallop, each swinging his lasso roundhis head. Ihe first who comes within reach aimsat the bull s horns, and when he sees, which hedoes in an instant, that the lasso will take effect,s -T) THE MONTHLYhe stops his horse, and turns it half round, the bull {continuing his course, till the whole cord has runtout from the guasso’s hand. .The horse, mean- .1while, knowing, by experience, what is going tothappen, leans over, as much as he can, in rise op¬posite direction from the bull, and stands initrembling expectation of the violent tug which is-given by the hull when brought up by the lasso,*So great, indeed, is the jerk which takes place at:this moment, that were the horse not to lean over,he would certainly be overturned; but standing, |as he does, with his feet planted firmly on theground, he offers sufficient resistance to stop thebull as instantaneously as it had been shot, thoughat full speed. In sortie cases, this check is soabrupt and violent, that the ailimai is not onlydashed to the ground, but rolls along- at the full Istretch of the lasso ; while the horse, drawn side- ■■ways, ploughs up the earth with his feet fot'several yards. This, which takes so long todescribe, is the work of a few seconds ; duringwhich the horseman gallops past ; and before thebull has time to recover from the shock, places thenoose over his horns, and continues advancing tillit also is at full stretch. The bull, stiipified bythe fall, sometimes' lies motionless on the ground ;but the horseman soon rouses him up, by tugginghim to and fro. When on his legs, with a horse¬man on each side, he is like a ship moored withtwo cables ; and however unwilling he may be toaccompany the guassos, or however great hisstruggles, he is irresistibly dragged along bythem in whatever direction they please.If the intention be to kill the annual tor the sakei of the hide and tallow alone, as is often the ease,1 one of the guassos dismounts, and running in, cuts■ the bull’s hamstrings with a long knife, which he■ always wears in his girdle ; and, instantly after-t wards, despatches him, by a dexterous cut acioss; the back of the neck. The most surprising thingis, the manner in which the horse, after being leftby his rider, manages to preserve the lasso always1 tight; this would be less difficult if the bull w’ereto remain steady, but it sometimes happens, thathe makes violent struggles to disentangle himselffrom the lassos, rushing backwards and forewardsin a furious manner. The horse, however, withi) wonderful sagacity, alters his place, and prancesit about, as if conscious of what he is doing, so as to• resist every movement of the bull, and never al-' lowing the lasso to be relaxed for a moment.When a wild horse is to be taken, the lasso isalways placed round the two hind legs, and, as thei guasso rides a little on one side, the jerk pullsI the entangled horse’s feet laterally, so as to throwi him on his side, without endangering his knees orI his face. Before the horse can recover the shock,| the rider dismounts, and snatching his poncho orI cloak from his shoulders, wraps it round the pros¬trate animal’s head ; he then forces into his mouthi one of the powerful bits of the country, straps as saddle on his back, and, bestriding him, removes1 the poncho; upon which, the astonished horsesprings on his legs, and endeavours, by a thousandvain efforts, to disencumber himself of his newi master, who sits quite composedly on his back;and, by a discipline which never fails, ml ces thihorse to such complete obedience, that he is sooiitrained to lend his speed and strength in the cap.tore of his wild companions.During the recent wars in this country, thdlasso was used as a weapon of great power in thtibhands of the guassos, who make bold and usefultroops, and never fail to dismount cavalry, or t(th row down the horses of those who come withiitheir reach. There is a well-authenticated storyof a party of eight or ten of these men, who harnever seen a piece of artillery, till one was fired atthem in the streets of Buenos Ayres : they gallop-*ed fearlessly up to it, placed their lassos over thecannon, and, by their united strength, fairly over¬turned it. Another anecdote is related of them,which, though possible enough, does not rest onsuch good authority. A number of armed boatswere sent to effect a landing at a certain point onthe coast, guarded solely by these horsemen. Theparty in the boats, caring little for an enemy un¬provided with fire-arms, rowed confidently alongthe shore. The goassos, meanwhile, were watch¬ing their opportunity, and the moment the boatscame sufficiently near, dashed into the water, and,throwing their lassos round the necks of the offi¬cers, fairly dragged every one of them out oftheir boats.   Capt.

Betty Lanshaw, by which the account oi this year'naturally divides itself into three heads or portions^First, of the placing.—It was a great affair; for11 was put in by the patron, and the people knewft nothing whatsoever of me, and their hearts werei‘stirred into strife on the occasion, and they did allI that lay within the compass of their power to keepme out, insomuch, that there was obliged to be a!■ guard of soldiers to protect the presbytery; and it> was a thing that made my heart grieve when Iheard the drum beating and the fife playing as wewere going to the kirk. The people were reallymad and vicious, and flung dirt upon us as wepassed, and reviled us all, and held out the fingerof scorn at me ; but I endured it with a resignedt spirit, compassionating their wilfulness and blind-• ness. Poor old Mr Kilfuddy of the Braehill gotn such a clash of glar on the side of his face, that hisII eye was almost extinguished.When we g^t to the kirk door, it was found tobe nailed up, so as by no possibility to be opened.1 ihe serjeant of the soldiers wanted to break it, but' I was afraid that the heritors would grudge and! complain of the expence of a new door, and Isupplicated him to let it be as it was ; we were,therefore, obligated to go in by a window, and thecrowd followed us, in the most unreverent manner,making the Lord’s house like an inn on a fair-day,with their grievous yellyhooing. During the timeof the psalm and the sermon, they behaved them-10 THE MONTHLYselves better, but when the induction came ontheir clamour was dreadful ; and Thomas Thenthe weaver, a pious zealot in that time, he got upand protested, and said, “ Verily, verily, I sayv.nto you, he that entereth not by the door rnh? itusheepfold, but climbetli up some other way, the.same is a thief and a robber.’J And 1 thought Iwould have a hat’d rtfid sore time of it with suchian outstrer^dlous people. Mr Given, that was.■ftfren the minister of Lugton, was a jocose man, andwould have his joke even at a solemnity. Whenthe laying of the hands upon me was a-doing, hecould not get near enough to put on his, hot hestretched out his staff’ and touched my head, andsaid, to the great (diversion of the rest,—“Thiswill do well enough, timber to timber but it wasan unfriendly saying of Mr Given, considering thelime and place, and the temper of my people.After the ceremony, we then got out at thewbathw, mi§ it was a heavy day to me, but wewmt i0 jhe and there we had ah excellenttidjfgT, wbitih Mm W&Uk of the new inns of Ir*vibe at my rcijueM, at)d sent her chaise-iUWet m serve, for he was likewise her waiter, shehaving then but one chaise, arid that no oftencalled for.But, although my people received me in this un¬ruly manner, 1 was resolved to cultivate civilityamong them ; and therefore, the very next morn¬ing 1 began a round of visitations ; but oh, it wasa steep brae that 1 had to climb, and it needed astout heart.

Never, I am sure, did CharlieMalcolm gamble atter that night.I often wondered what brought Mrs Malcolmto our clachan, instead of going to a populous town,where she might have taken up a huxtry-shop, asshe was but of a silly constitution, the which wouldhave been better for he than spinning from morn¬ing to far in the night, as if she was in veritydrawing the thread of life. But it was, no doubt,from an honest pride to hide her poverty j forw hen her daughter Effie was ill with the measlesthe poor lassie was very ill—nobody thought shewould come through, and when she did get thethe turn, she was for many a day a heavy handful;-our session being rich, and nobody on it butcripple Tammy Daidles, that was in that timeknown through all the country side for begging ona horse, I thought it my duty to call upon MrsMalcolm, in a sympathizing way, and offer hersome assistance, but she refused it.^°» s'r> said she, “ I canna take help fromthe poor’s box, although it is very true that I amin great need ; for it might hereafter be cast upto my bairns, whom it may please Ciod to restoreto better circumstances when I am no to see’t;but I would fain borrow five pounds, and if, sir,you will write to Mr Maitland, that is now theLord Provost of Glasgow, and tell him thatMarion Shaw would be obliged to him for the lendof that soom, I think he will not fail to send it.”14 THE MONTHLYI wrote the letter that night to Provost Maitland,and hy the retouf of the post, I got dn answer, withtwenty pounds for Mrfe Malcolm,' salving, “ thatit was with sorrow he Iteard so small a trifie con Idbe servieeahle.” Wlreti 1 took the letter and themoney, which was in a bank-bill^ she said, “ thisis just like himdeiV5 She then told me, that MrM aitland had been a gentleman's son of the eastcountry, but driven out of his father’s house, whetsa laddie, by his step-mother ; and that he hadserved as a sei cant lad with her father, who wasthe Laird of \ illcogiej but ran through his estate,and left her, his oily daughter, in little better thanbdggary with hei- auntie, the mother of CaptainMalcolm, her husband that Was.

He then married arich lady, and in time grew, as he was, LordProvost of the city ; but his letter with the twentypounds to me, shewed that he had not forgottenhis first love. It was a short, but a well-writtenletter, in a fair hand of write, containing much ofthe true gentleman; and Mrs Malcolm said,“ Who knows but out of the regard he once hadfol- their mother, he may do something for myfive helpless orphans.”Thirdly, upon tile subject of taking my cousin,Miss Betty Lmtsliaw, for my first wife, I havelittle to say.

And as soonas the placing was well over, and the manSe in or¬der, I gaed to Ayr, where she was, and We wererpvietly married, and came home in a chaise, bring¬ing with us her little brother Andrew, that died inthe East Indies, and he lived and was brought unby os'. 1Now, this is all, I think, that happened in thatyear; worthy of being mentioned, except that atthe sacrament, when old Mr Kilfuddie waspreaching in the tent, it came on such a thmidfer-pl’ump, that there was not a single soul stayed inthe kirk-jaard to hear him ; for the which he Wasgreatly mortified, and never after came to ourpreachings. GaiLSECESSION CHURCH.1 tiK SECt-liBus are a numerous body of Scottish1 resbyteriaus, who first broke off' from the kirkestflhlishuEefit about the year 1733. The Secessionwas formed on the alleged ground of corruption,hotii in doctrine and government, in the Nationalk hnrch, and with a view to restore the genuineprinciples of Presbyterianism. In the salutarywm k of reform, the celebrated Ebfe/iezer and RalphLrskme took a leading part j and in 1745, the16 THE MONTHLYseceding ministers were become so numerous, thatthey disjoined themselves into three different pres¬byteries, under one synod. A disagreement havingtaken place among them relative to the Burgessoath, administered in several of the royal boroughsof Scotland, they have since been distinguished in ,to Burghers and Antiburghers, and meet indifferent synods.Both parties affirm, that the established kirk ofScotland still perseveres in a course of defectionfrom her professed principles, and consequentlythat the grounds of secession, which at first weresufficient to justify a separation from her com¬munion, have increased ; hence the Seceders aregaining in number and strength to the present day.Their form of worship is the same as in the estab¬lished kirk, and their discipline the same as used tobe universally practised in the kirk, but which isalmost generally disused. So that the churchgovernment of the Seceders is Presbyterian, andtenets strictly Cajvinistic.The Seceders hold no communion with other so¬cieties. The settlement of their ministers alwaysproceeds upon a popular election, and the candidateis ordained by the suffrages of a majority. Amongboth parties of the Seceders the Gospel is gene-, rally preached, and endeavours are used to committhe ministry only to serious and faithful men.Some ministers deliver three public discourses 01the Lord’s day, publicly catechise, and piivatelyvisit their congregations once a year, without re¬spect of persons. Private baptism is rejected as arelie of popery ; the Lord’s supper is administereconce or twice, anrl some four times, in a yeir, an 1care is taken to admit none to communion but suchas make a credible profession of Chiistianity.1 hey never accept of a sum of money as a com¬mutation for any oflence, as is done in the esta¬blished kirk, but every offender is subjected to pub¬lic admonition or exclusion. Yet notwithstanding-the strictness of their discipline, and their rigidadherence to the original principles of Presby¬terianism, it is apprehended that many of the pre¬sent generation ot Seceders fall considerably shortot their predecessors in knowledge, piety, andzeal, i he increase of both parties in the Secessionhas however been rapid and extensive ; they nowhave upwards ot two hundred congregations, andsome ot them consist ot lull a thousand members.In the yeai 1820 a union of these two bodieswas effected ; atid they are now designated “ I'heUnited Associate Synod.I" 1/99 a division took place in the Burgherbranch of the Secession, in reference to the 23rdchapter of the Confession of Faith, regarding thepower of the civil magistrate in religious matters.he party who considered this portion of their Stan¬dard as an infringement on liberty of conscience,were by far the most numerous, and were designated“ New Light Burghers ; whilst the other party," 0 af hered literally to the disputed requirement,were denominated “Old Light and assumed,as their distinctive appellation, the name of“ Original Burghers.”In 1806, a division also took place in thenti- urgher hi finch of the Secession, upon thei n r.same question ; and the two parties were also de¬signated by the same appellatives. They designa¬ted themselves the “Constitutional AssociatePresbytery and seem more strictly to considerthe binding obligation of the covenant ; and thatthe ordinary exercise of civil authority is necessaryto the better promoting of the interests of moralityand religion, and may warrantably be employedin settling, not only secular affairs, but also thepeace, order, and security of the church of Christ,in the permanent enjoyment of her own peculiarliberties and government.THE REFORMERS.What an inexhaustible subject, is the deformityof vice and the loveliness of virtue ! how incontes-tible, how convincing, are the proofs ! but, if mora¬lists were in earnest, they would find, that thesurest mode of amending others, is first to reformthemselves.Two citizens, who were neighbours, often in¬dulged themselves with a morning’s walk in thevicinity of the metropolis, before the hurryinghours of business came on. In one of these earlyperambulations, after ordinary conversation hadceased, one of them lamented the deluge of vice,which like an inundation, had overspread the wholeland ; that virtue was driven to the very confinesof these once-happy realms ; and that even charityherself was preparing to depart : yet, amongst thegeneral dearth of beneficence, he himself had aheart so very compassionate that it uniformly melt-XJWWiVtJ ./ed with sorrow at a tale of woe, and he longed fornothing more than opportunities to relieve thedistresses of his feuow creatures.He had scarcely finished this fine harangue,when a good looking man in plain attire, approach¬ed them, humbly soliciting their attention to hismournful story ; he said that his house had been'burnt, and his stock in trade completely destroyed,at the same time producing vouchers for (the truthof his assertions, from persons of the most umloubt-ed credibility.rhe citizen who had not spoken declared hisinability to relieve the unfortunate petitioner ; butobserved to his friend, that h<»re was a fine oppor¬tunity of displaying his favourite virtue. The be¬neficent man, however, declared that pity, was allhe could then afford, and he never carried moneyabout him.1 he'other on'the departure of the poor mendi¬cant, began to upbraid his friend : telling him heshould have relieved the man himself, had he not;been withheld from delicate motives, not wishing'to deprive him of his darling pleasure, and again*charity, being a virtue to which he had never pre*.tended. “ Now,” added he, to his abashed com*pauion, “ yon have clearly demonstrated that be¬nevolence is your characteristic, valor is mine! Ilook with reverence on the’annals of former times,which furnish us with so many' instances* of admi¬rable intrepidity ; and sadly regret the want ofmagnanimity in our days, yet, notwithstanding thisalmost general defection, I think I may withoutvamty, boast of as much personal courage as any\THE MONTHLYman breathing ; and only require a proper occasionof eliciting proofs of it.”They had by this time strolled into the fields at,a considerable distance from any houses, when anarmed robber rushed suddenly from behind ahedge, and with imprecations, threatened themwith instant death, unless they immediately de¬livered their money“ Now,” says the charitable man, “ now myfriend, exert yourself andsaye our livesand property.”But the threats of the footpad, so intimidatedthe worthy moralists, that they very quietly de¬livered their purses.The valiant person, was now ironically upbraid¬ed by his companion, who positively declared, thatif he had rendered the least assistance, he wouldundoubtedly have secured the thief and given himup to justice.“ You could not certainly have expected me,”said he “ to rush on with chivalric spirit to theattack, for I have naturally a very dtlicate senseof clanger, and require evident odds in my favour,if ever I came to an encounter, for valor is notmy forte, but and a truce to recrimination; letus from henceforth cease to upbraid each other,for we have proved evidently enough, that thoughcharity and bravery are terms we understand per¬fectly well, we nevertheless willingly leave thepractice to other men.vREPUBLICAN SIMPLICITY OF LIFE.During the American war of 1799) a Britishofficer was sent with a flag from George town toSCRAP BOOK. 21settle with Marion, the American general, con¬cerning an exchange of prisoners. When led intoMarion’s presence, and the bandage taken from hiseyes, the British officer, instead of the imposingdignity he expected to behold, was astonished tosee a little sallow man, clad in a thread-bare home-spun suit, surmounted by a few sun-burnt, half-naked militia men, roasting potatoes in the ashes,with their black firelocks, and coarse unseemlypowder horns, lying beside them on logs. Havingrecovered a little from his surprise, the officer pre¬sented a letter to General Marion, and the exchangewas adjusted to their mutual satisfaction. Theofficer took up his hat to retire, “ pray Sir,” saidMarion, “ give me the pleasure of your companyto dinner, it is now about our time.” The Britishofficer glancing his eyes to the fire-place, saw no¬thing to flatter his hopes ; but could not, consistentwith good manners, decline the invitation. Thegeneral called to one of his men to produce thedinner—Tom, (as the general named the fellowwho held the capacity of cook and waiter,) with apine-stick fork, liberated a quantity of sweet pota¬toes from the embers and ashes, pinching each toassure himself they were well done ; having madethem clean, as he supposed, partly by blowing onthem with his breath, and partly by rubbing themwith the sleeve of his cotton shirt; he took a largepiece of bark, and piled some of the best potatoesbefoie the British officer. The British officer wasa well-bred man, and pretended to eat of this rus¬tic fare ; but before they parted General Marioninspired him with heartfelt respect, “ Sir,” said he,^2 THE MONTHLY“ I feel perhaps, as AgesHaus felt, when the Per¬sians were astonished at the rude simplicity of hisg'arb, but I am in love.

Eat stale bread—mutton and beef in preference Topork or veal—light puddings of flour or rice ; gruel or milk may beeaten with impunity. Abstain fram all add drinks, such as staleib er,porter or cyder ; and instead, drink fresh mild beer, or very weak ginand water. If these arc beyond your means, take ginger tea ; neverdrink bad water, or cold water, when you are heated by exercise. Donot get drunk, for cholera has-seized the drunkard first in all countriesin which it has prevailed, i?e temperate in all things and fear not.Avoid, if y'*u can, too great exertion and f'a'igite—shun the sight airand the heavy dues which fall afier hot days—do not bailie in cold w’a-ter. or take violent dose;, of physic, llemove all offensive dung-heapsthat may be near your house, as well as decaying vegetables—clear outor cover over all drains, gutters, or cesspools—lime wash jour house—keep open your windows, except at night—be clearily in your persons,ami keep your children so—pay no unnecessary visits to sick persons.Those who liave had bad health and weak bowels should wear a broadflannel belt. If you have even a slight bowel complaint, send at oncefar your medical attendant; if you live in the country, and must waitsome time before he can arrive, take thirty or forty drops of laudanum,a little magnesia, and half a glass of brandy or gin, mixed all together.SCRAP COOK.aSComforts of Transportation—Aa little is kii-'Tn in this countrj’onfbe subject, we give an extract explanatory of. the “ comforts” avjoyedby convicts in Van Diemen’s I-sTiu and New South vl’alea ;—Comfort 1st—As soon as kc lands he is packed cff-CO, or 70, t>r W©miles in the inferior, or he is placed in the prisoner’s harraaks—ofwhich-it would be only necessary for any H-on, Member to see the in¬side to convince him it was no joke—in either of which cases, if he hasbrought any trifles with him, he is sure to be relieved of them beforef!;e following day. If he does not lose his Government .cl^tliing, Jtemay consider himself fortunate ; should he, .however, do so, the follow¬ing .morning he may safely calculate upon—Comfort "2nd in the shape of fifty lashes, or ten day’s work on ihutread-mill-, or in the chain-gang.Comfort flrd.—If he be assigned to a.master in the town, and hap¬pens to take a glass of grog after his long voyage, it is a great chance ifhe lodge not in the watch-house for the night, and take ‘ fitly’ beforebreakfast in the morning by way of ‘ comfort.’Comfort 4th Travelling througn a wild forest without knowing hisway, and surrounded perhaps by the hostile aborigines, who, so sure asthey meet would kill him.Comfort oth—-Should he lose his way, and escape starvation in thebush, probably a sound flogging for not having arrived sooner at hismaster’s house-Comfort Gth Perpetual wo:k and no pay ; in many cases hardlabour, hard living, hard words, and ha:d usage.We have hitherto spoken only of the reception met with by a well-disposed prisoner—one who wishes to reform. If he be in any way re¬fractory, let the good people of England thoroughly understand that heis sure of a most adequate reward. A short answer, when spoken toby his master or overseer, or a common soldier, or even a qonvict con-! stable, is a crime punishable by flogging ; getting tipsey places him inl the stocks; missing muster may get him flogged, or into the chainI gang, where be works m irons on the roads, hliould he commit anyI second offence, Macquarie Harbour, Poit Siscquarie. Norfolk Island,or Moreton Bay is his fate; where every rigidity of discipline nay,s sometimes even cruelty—is exercised. The hardest of labour, and butone meal a-day, of tire coarsest feed, is the lot of a man who goes to a1 penal settlement. To these places it does not take felony to send aprisoner ; many have been removed there for very trivial offences. The,j gallant colonel, who wishes for places of horror and terror as recepta-• cles for criminals, need not go fdr a-field ; we can supply him with suchplaces as would s'atisfy the most insatiate appetite for torturing and; punishing. When men commit murder on purpose to be hanged, in(preference to bearin g the terrors of these places of secondary exile, itf cannot be expectad that they are in the enjoyment of much ‘ comfort.’This is no opposition tirade ; nor is the statement made for ouricolonial readers-: the facts are too well known here to require descrip¬tion. It is a true picture, intended for the eye of our numerous| English readers.” v24 THE MONTHLYA Remarkable Anecdote Lord Craven lived in London when thelast great plague raged. His house was in that part of the town calledCraven Buildings. ' On that sad calamity growing epidemic, his Lord-ship, to avoid the danger, resolved to retire to his seat in the country.His coach and six were accordingly at the door, the baggage put up,and all things in readiness for the journey. As he was walking through'his hall with his hat on, his cane under his arm, and putting on hisigloves, in order to step into his carriage, he overheard his negro (whoserved him as postilion) say to another servant, “ I suppose, by myLord’s quitting London to avoid the plague, that his god lives in thecountry, aud not in town.” The poor negro said this in the simplicityof his heart, as really believing a plurality of gods. The speech, however, struck Lord Craven very sensibly, and made him pause—” MyGod (thought he) lives everywhere, and can preserve me in town, awell as in the country ; I’ll e’en stay where I am. The ignorance othat negro has preached a useful sermon to me—Lord, pardon that ur.belief, and that distrust of thy providence, which made me think arunning away from thy hand.” He immediately ordered the horses t.be taken from the coach, and the luggage to be brought in. He coutinucd in London, was remarkably useful among his sick neighbonrsand never caught the infection.Caledonian Estimation of Money A Scotch pedestrian, attacheby three highwaymen, defended himself with great courage and obst;nacy, but was at last overpowered, and his pockets rifled. The rotbers expected, from the extraordinary resistance they had experiencedto~ lay their hands on some rich booty ; but were not a little surpriseto discover, that the whole treasure which the sturdy Caledonian habeen defending at the hazard of his life, consisted of no more thancrooked sixpence “ The duce is in him,” said one of the roguet• if he had possessed eighteen-pence, I suppose he would have killethe whole of us.GARDEN WORK IN SEPTEMBER.Plant strawberries and box-edgings.

Finding, how-t ever, that the devouring element was rapidly: spreading, and that volumes of smoke were: issuing from all the four hatchways, Captain(Cobb, with ability and decision of characterthat seemed to increase with the imminence\ of the danger, resorted to the only alternativemow left him, of ordering the lower ports tot be opened, for the free admission of the watery-I element.These instructions were speedily executedby the united efforts of the troops and seamen}r but not before some of the sick soldiers, andone woman, and several children, unablej to ga}n the upper deck, had perished.

One younglady who had resolutely refused to fjuit herfather, whose sense of duty kept him at hispost, was near falling a sacrifice to her filialdevotion, not haying been picked up untilshe had' sunk five or six times. Anotherindividual, who was reduced to the frightfulalternative of losing his wife or his children,hastily decided in favour of his duty to theformer™ His wife was accordingly saved,but his four children, alas ! were left to perish.A fine young fellow, a soldier, who hadneither wife nor child of his own, but whoevinced the greatest solicitude for the safetyof those of others, insisted on having threechildren lashed to him. with whom he plung¬ed into the waters : not beihg able to reachthe boat, he was again drawn into the ship13witli his charge, but Hot before two of thechildren bad expired. One man fell down thehatchway into the flamed, alid another hadhis back so completely broken as to hav6lbeen obser+ed quite doubled fallen overboard.These numerous spectacles of individual lossand suffering were not confined to the en¬trance upon the perilous voyage between thetwo ships. One man whd fell between theboat and the brig, had his head literallycrushed io pieces ; and some others were lostin their attempts to ascend the side of theCambria.Seeing that the tardy means employed forthe escape of all tlie women and children,necessarily consumed a great deal of timethat might be partly devoted to the generalpreservation, orders were given that alongwith the females, each of the boats shouldalso admit a certain portion of the' soldiers;several of whom, in their impatience to takeadvantage of this permission, flung them-'selves overboard, and sunk in their ill-judgedand premature efforts for deliverance.One poor fellow of this number, a Veryrespectable man had actually reached the boat,and was raising his hand to lay hold on thegunnel, when the bow of the boat, by asudden pitch, struck him on the head and heinstantly went down.There was a peculiarity attending this man’scase that deserves notice. His wife to whomhe was warmly attached, not having been of7Lima on) •vurmbfiMlq •/iiogito ntmn.uojber of women jljo accompany,(thej^gime.nt abroad, respited iu her anxiety,to fpUqvy her liusbaud, to defeat his arangq-njqnts, an^ accordingly repaired with the de-,taphnaeut to Gravesend where she ingeniotti$)j.Y!managed, by eluding the vigilance, (ji' thf 'sentries, to get on hoard, and Jo conceal henTi^elf for several days ; . gad, although she wasdiscovered, and sent ashore at, Deal,, she co«-triyed a second tinie with trqe pggdseverari,ce, t«.get between decks,contrived to secret herself until the inorningiof the fatal disaster. aii’dfllflOr .Vi4dV> VtH’iousways on seljtt-preservation, one of the sailors,jwho had taken his post with many othersoyer the maga?^no, awaiting wfth great pati¬ence fiiq dreaded explosion,.at,last cried out,a|S,tfdp ill hqmo.tn; that, his expectations werelikely to be. disappointed, “Well, if she won’tblow up, i ll see if 1 can't get out of her;"and instantly jumping up, he made the bestof his way to one of the boats, which I under¬stand he readied in safety. hua...^pught, to^gto^that.three ;out of the sixboats wy originsIIy Pfisse5sed, were eitluercon)p}etely orjswgniped jn; .the ■ courseof tbp day, ony iof tjieni withmen ii it, some,of wluun were seen boating jn the water fora moment before they disappeared}, artd t.t issuspected tUgf one or (if those who, wentdpWin^ipnsjt have funk .tjnder the..Weight ofthyiy spoils, t.he‘sjujie.(nd>vidu.de having.beoaseen eageidy jilundering the cuddy cabins.As the daj? was rapidly drawing toclose,«0a^jUp e WggJHi^iiiB^Wt,9g4rpiextending,.

Butstill less can I pmirtray the alternate picturesof awful joy, and yf wild distraction, exhibit¬ed by the sulfereis, (for both parties for themoment seemed equally to suffer,) as theterrible truth was communicated, that theyi and their children were indeed left husband*J[ess and fatherless; or as the objects fromwhom they hail feared they wei;e fyr eversevered, rushed suddenly into their arms.Bof these fpelings of delight, whatevermay have been their intensity, were speedilychastened, and the attention of all arrested,by the last tremendous spectacle of destruction.After the arrival of the last boat, the flames,which had spread along the upper deck andpoop, ascended with the rapidity of lightningto. the masts, apd rigging, forming one generalpunflagration, that illumined the heavens toan immense distance and was strongly reflect¬ed on several objects on board the brig. At! last about half-past one o’clock in the morn¬ing, the devouring element having communi¬cated with the magazine, the long threatenedexplosion was seen, and the blazing fragmentsof the once magnificent Kent were instantlyhurried like so many rockets, high into the air.Shortly afterwards the brig, which had beengradually making sail, was running at the rateof nine or ten miles an hour towards the near¬est pert.featapias possiWe lostj'a’ftef.iillVPalirVbfetn^ Itit‘Tfi6' cBiirae Af ihitriorniiifr all! jirepftred, 'vith j'iyflil liea'rt^to l epla’ce our fedt on the sliores (if OlHiffli'-'i <K’moq i »«•* e*wnriRThe latTies, always flesWnedf til fphriVanguard, \Vere the first to dlsemhal'Tt.The sailors and sdnliers, cold "Wet and ftlymost naked! rtniiikly followed1; /ffie wholeforming, in their haggard looks, and the end¬less vafiefiy dftneif ‘t A‘fi( ‘Jnaettibf&pat onde’ias rnelan'ehdly aylfl grotesqud' ;fti it1 ispossible to cdneeiye.

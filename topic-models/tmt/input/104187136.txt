ye soon can put down,The coal-scuttle isn’t more black than your frownj|In vain at your feet I am dying all day,You’re deaf as a sauce-pan to all I can say.O Judy, &c.THE BLOOM IS ON THE RYE.My pretty Jane, my pretty Jane!Ah ! never, never look so shy,But meet me, meet me in the evening,While the bloom is on the rye.5The spriug is waning fast, my love,The corn is in the earThe summer nights are coming, love,The moon shines bright and clear.Then pretty Jane, my dearest Jane!Ah! never, never look so shy,But meet me, meet me in the evening,While the bloom is on the rye.But name the day, the wedding day,And I will buy the ring ;The lads and maids in favours white,And village bells—the village bells shall ring.The spring is waning fast, my love,The corn is in the ear,The summer nights are coming, love,The moon shines bright and clear.Then pretty Jane, my dearest Jane!Ah! never, never look so shy,But meet me, meet me in the evening,While the bloom is on the rye.THE LILY OF FRANCE.et the lily of Franco in luxuriance wave.Let the shamrock of Erin its beauty maintain,et the rose of fair England still wave its perfume,But the thistle of Scotland will dearest remain.To Scotia her thistle, her broad waving thistle,The evergreen thistle will dearest remain.’TVas the badge that our fathers triumphantly woreWhen they follow’d their sovereigns to vanquish riDane ;The emblem in battle our Wallace aye bore,Then the thistle of Scotland must dearest remaii |To Scotia her thistle, &c.It blooms on our mountains, it blooms in the vale,It blooms in the winter, in snow, and in rain ;The type of her sons when rude seasons assail—To Scotia her thistle will dearest remain.To Scotia her thistle, &c.THE LIGHT OF OTHER DAYS.The light of other days is faded.And all their glory’s past,For grief with heavy wing hath shadedThe hopes too bright to last;The world which morning’s mantle clouded.Shines forth with purer rays ;But the heart ne’er feels, in sorrow shrouded,The light of other days.But the heart ne’er feels, in sorrow shrouded.The light of other days.The leaf, which autumn tempests wither,The birds, which then take wing,When winter’s winds are past, come hitherTo welcome back the spring ;7The very ivy on the ruin,Its gloomful life displays ;But the heart alone sees no renewingThe light of other days.But the heart alone sees no renewingThe light of other days.RORY O’MORE.foung Rory O’More courted Kathleen Bawn,le was bold as a hawk, and she, soft as the dawn,le wish’d in his heart pretty Kathleen to please,l.nd he thought the best way to do that was to teaze ;‘Now, Rory be aisy,” sweet Kathleen would cry,leproof on her lip, but a smile in her eye,rVith your tricks I don’t know, in troth, what I’m11 about,i'aith, you’ve teaz’d till I’ve put on my cloak insideout;‘Oh !

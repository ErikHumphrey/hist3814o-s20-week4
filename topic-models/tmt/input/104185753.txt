The friends andgood neighbours went alang wi’John to the kirk,where Maggy chanced to< meet him, and was mar-12thegither, and came hame in a crowd ; and at every*change-house they chanced to pass by, ProvidenceStopt by their proceeding with full stoups, bottles,and glasses, drinking their healths, wishing themjoy, ten girls and a boy. Jockey seeing so manywishing well to his health, coupt up what he had gotfor to augment his health, and gar him live long,which afterwards couped him up, and proved himdetrimental to the same.So hame they came to the dinner, where his mi¬lker presenting to them a piping liet haggis, madeof the creesh of the tdack bonl horned ewe, boiled13in the meikle pot, mixt with beer meal, onions, spiceand mint. This haggis being supt warm, the foamjing swats and spice in the liquor set John’s belly a-bizzing like a working fat. His mither cried tospence him, and bed him with the bride. Pale andt ghostly was his face, and closed were baithhiseen.Ah I cries Lis mither, a dismal day indeed , hisbridal and his burial may be in ae day. Some cuistwater jn his face and jag’d him wi the needle, tillbroken wmrds. Mither, mither ! cries Jockey, warj am I now ? Whar are you now, my bairn, saygI his mither, ye are bedet, and I’ll bring the bride to' you. Beded, says Jockey, and is my bridal donei else ? Ay is’f, said his mither, and here is the bridet says Jockey. I’ll no lie wi’ an unco woman indeed,i come to lie down beside ye, man.

Thehumslieugbs were very great, until auld uncle Rab- fby came in to redd them ; and a sturdy auld fellowhe was ; he stood Lively with a stiff’rumple, and bystrength of bis arms rave them aye sunder, flingingthe taen east and the titber west, till they stood a’round about like,as many for-foughten cocks andno ane durst steeranother for him.

O then he gaed wud, andlooked as waeful like as he had been tod-lorie; come frae worrying lambs, with his bloody mouth.’ With that he gets an auld flail and rives awa they supple, then drives them a’ to the back of the door^,but nane wan out; then wi’chirting and clapping oj hands down comes the clay hallen4 and the henbawkf, wi’ Rab Reid the fiddler, who had crept up besideI the hens, for the preservation of his fiddle.Ben comes the bride, when she got on her coat,oj clappet Rabby on the shouther, and bade him sparetf. their lives, for their was blood enough shed in ae4night, quoth she ; and that my beard can witness| quoth he. So they all came in obedience to uncleRabby’ for his supple made their pows baith saftand sair that night; but daft Maggy Simpson satdby the fife and picked banes a‘ the time of the bat-jlllfe.

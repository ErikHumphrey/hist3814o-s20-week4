crown.Moft of the Forts were in their hands,Stirling, Bothwel, and Dunbar^And nothing could redeem the land,but hot and bloody war.Our nobleKng was {fill defeat,and to the woods banifh'd;Till fortune’s wheel turn’d up her fpake,and s wonted courage rais'd.But the defperadoes of the landunto their king have flown.And vow'd to die thro’ fweet revenge,than bear the Engli& frown.8The king’s bold brother E l ward Bruce,in Gadoway d:d refid^.Affift l by the brave Douglass,whatever did betide.The forts and caftlet they retook,made many Engiifli dree,Rutherglen's ftout Peel they did reduceand after took Dundee.Bold Moubray Stirling Cattle kept,(a place of noted fame)And when the Scots laid fiege therehe would not yield the fame.At laftatreafv did conclude,for twelv* mouths and a day,If Edward did net him relieve,he then fbould march away.Thus peace proclaim’d on ev'ry fide,both did *hc r freedom ufe ;And Moubray did to London ride,and told the king the news.And is the Scots

kneel’d unto the cnjcifix,before one bow was bent.The Engliih hoil perceiving this,they thought they fainting were.But loon convinc’d by arrows keen,there was no fainting there.The firft charge on the left began,with Eighfh horfr oa flight,Where hundreds tumbled in the ditch,to Scots a pkafant fight,9Then Murray fiercely on them fet,and did no mercy ftiewr,While men and horfe ftuck in the mir?3and

were near undone,they had too much ado.Till Murray had his battle done,and came to their relcue.The battle new in general was,and (preading o’er tke land,Frefh Englifli troops ftili maiching CQ,by their fierce king's command.When on the top of Gillies-craig,appeared in their fight,A crowd like twenty thouiand men,which were no men ol might.10But wives and old decripped men,foinedaffiis and

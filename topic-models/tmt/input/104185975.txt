oh dear ! the queer little comical soul,Ever will laud the hands that applaudThe lad with the carroty poll.LAY OF THE MILL:OK THE PLEASURES OF THE PAY-SIGHT.Hey, the merry pay-night.Ho, the merry pay-night ;’Tis fun to see how we agree,Upon the merry pay-night;|That night we clear the lawin score,And then again begin the splore ;Whilst, drunk as lords, we sit and roarUpon the merry pay night !Hey, the merry, &c.Then Johnny plays his monkey tricks.An’ knocks the timmer things tae sticks;An’ wife an’ weans a’ get their lichs,Upon the merry pay-night !Hey the merry, &c.7Oar neighbours, when they hear the din.Then helter-skelter they come in ;An’ teeth-an’ nail we a’ beginUpon the merry pay night :Hey, the merry, 8rc.The Police are a meddling pack.They’ll no let neighbours hae their crack :But pounce at aince upon their backUpon the merry pay-night !Hey, the merry, &c.Then aff they march ns in a raw,Wi’ police-bracelets on each paw :An’ wow but we are unco brawUpon the merry pay-night !Hey, the merry, 8zc.But Monday settles a’ disputes—Then we maun pawn our bits o’ cloutsTo pay our fines, for bloody snoutsWe got upon the pay-night !Hoy, the merry, &c.THE SOVEREIGN BANK.A Ploughman down in Somersetshire,Who’d saved up ten pound-notes, I’m told.Hearing how bankers fail’d, did swearHe’d have his notes all changed for gold.He got his purse, but was so cross,’Cause Ids son smiled, he wopped the younker,Then went, and begg’d the farmer’s horse,Ami on he gallop’d to the banker.3He soon got to the banker's shop.And there he said—“ Tho’ they he old.You know these notes again, so, cup,Change them for soverines of gold.”When they’d paid him ten pounds in cash.He vas so pleased at the bright show.He said, “ I hope ’twont make you smash.But rharity ’gins at home, you know.”Quite pleased, he to the inn did spankTo treat him with a mug of yale ;When some one said, the Sovereign BankHad fail’d—or it was like to fail!When he heard this, he in a crackReturn’d to bank with might and main.And said, “ Cup take your soverines back.And just give me my notes again.”When he’d his notes> he did beginTo blow them up, and said, “ You crew !You thought to take a poor man in.But, dang it!

Hole.Not caring for her damn’d prat,Resolving to retaliate,Whatever next should he my fate,And soon I’d make her head roll.Then who came in hut Billy Wright,And we like fools began to fight.We broke the glass put out the light,And we soon found out the Coal Hole.Who to my surprise next came in,Was a gay young coxcomb tali and slim,And round his hat he’d a gay gold rim.And in his hand a long pole.Says he my lad I charge you this,Put on your clothes and quit the place.Or damn me If I ever ceaseTill 1 march you to the Coal Hole.Not caring for this cowardly prince.Or as little for his consequence,I bade him stand in his own defenceOr soon Td make his head roll.Then he went out as quick as thought,The watchman I suppose he sought,For he more than half a dozen brought,And they marched me to the Coal HoleWhen I went there surprised to view,A number of the female crew,Some dressed in black and some in blur;'The sight to me seemed cpiite droll.15Says they my lad don’t he afraid.Nor any way seem the least dismay’dFor almost every spree young hlade.Sometimes comes to the Coal Hole.But since I’m free I’ll no more fight,Nor any way stop out late at night;For to tell the truth I’ve ne’er been right,Since I got such a curs’d roll.Black were my eyes and scrathed my lace,Besides it’s brought me to disgrace.And makes poor Jack for to curse the place,Which people call the Coal Hole.THE LIFE OF A SOLDIER.When I was an infant, gossips would say,I when older, would be a soldier,Rattles and toys I threw them away;Unless a gun or a sabre.I a yo linker, up I grew.Saw one day a grand review:Colours flying, set me a dying.To embark in a life so new.CHORUS.Roll drums merrily march away,Soldiers glory, lives in story.His laurels are green, when his locks they are gray.Then huzza for the life of a soldier.Listed—to battle I marched along,Courting danger fear a stranger,Tire cannon beat time to tire trumpets song.Which made m.v heart a hero’s:16Charge our gallant leader cry.On like Lyons then we fly;Blood and thunder, foes knocked under.Then huzza for a victory.Then who so merry as we in a campBattle over live in cover.Care and his cronies are forced to tramp.And all is social pleasure.Then we laugh we quaff we sing,Time goes gaily on the wing;Smiles of beauty, sweeting duty,Then each private is a king.SAINT PATRICK WAS A GENTLEMAN.Saint Patrick was a gentleman,And came of decent people ;In Dublin town he built a church.And he put upon’t a steeple;His father was O’Callaghan,His mother was O’Brady ;His Aunt was an O'Saugnessy,And his uncle an O’Grady.Then success to bold St Patrick’s fist.He was a saint so clever;He gave the snakes and toads a twistAnd banished them for ever.There’s no a mile in Ireland’s isle.Where the durty varment musters.Where’er he put bis dear fore footHe murder’d them in clusters.17The toads went hop, the frogs went lop.Slap dash Into the water.And the bastes commited suicideTo save themselves from slaughter.Then success, &c.Nine hundred thousand vipers blueHe charm’d with sweet discourses,And din’d on them at KillalooIn soups and second courses;When blind-worms crawling in the grassDisgusted all the nation.He gave them a rise, and open’d their eyesTo a sense of their situation.Then success, Szc.No wonder that our Irish boysShould be so free and frisky.It was St Patrick taught them firstThe joys of tippling whisky ;No wonder that the Saint himselfTo taste it should be willing,T'or his mother kept a whisky shop.In the town of Enniskillen.Then success, &c.The Wicklow hills are very high,So’s the hill of Howth, sir.But there’s a hill much higher still.Aye, higher than them both, sir;’Twas on the top of this high hillSt Patrick preach’d the sarmint.He drove the frogs into the bogs,And bother’d all the varmint.Then success, &c.St Patrick ha$ a great regardFor those who'came before him,He knev< the Kang of France would needA paddy to restore him ;The French went skipping thro’ the hogs.There hearts crammed full of treason,We’ll send them Paddy WellingtonTo druh them to their reason.Then success, Ac.THE COBBLER AND GOOSE.A Cobbler lived at york,A merry man was he;His wife took needle-work,A good kind soul was sheEasy as an old shoeThey pass’d their lives together;And of a piece, ’tis true,lake sole and upper leather. *(Spoken.) They were a happy couple, workedhard, and never grumbled at the times or at eachother,—that’s a rare thing in our days,—while shenimbly employed her needle, lie hammered away atthe lapstone, and sungRan ! tan ! tan !The cobbler bought a goose,And fatted it quite high;Somehow the bird got looseThe day it was to die.Here “ Pegs,” bawl’d out the wife,“ Run after the goose to win her.”10Goosey she ran for her life,And the cobbler for his dinner.(Spoken.) Away he went, and the boys afterdrn, calling out “Now, cobbler! now, goose;wo to one upon Pegs,” Egad! he almost caught■er once, when his foot slipped, and headlong he' /ent into a sty among a litter of pigs, and onlyraved his bacon by leaving the flaps of his jacket inhe old sow’s grinders; but Pegs wasn’t to beabashed ; be followed her through bush and brier,ijjogs, quagmires, over houses, trees, hedges, ditches,fclds, cats, dogs, cocks, hens, cows, bulls, and pigs,it last he knocked down the stall of an old woman,ho sold hot apple dumplings, which made a rareoramble for the boys—and what could they do, butinS ,r.Ran, &c.By the river, he seized her rump.But she got loose with a scream:And he fell in the water plump.While goosey cross’d the stream.So finding the chase no use.He went home in a shiver;Told wifey he had lost the goose.But got a fine duck—in the river.(Spohm') “Oh! wife, wife,” he cried,” i’vejd rny morning’s wet; the goose has gone a gandor-nting.

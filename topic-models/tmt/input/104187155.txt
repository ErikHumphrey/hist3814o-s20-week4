I.'The Banishment of the Lady Bellifant, who wa*i delivered of two fine Sons at a Birth, viz. Vai-I entine awl Orson, in a wood.It is recorded that Pepin, King of France, hada fair sister called Bellifant, who was married toAlexander, Emperor of Greece, and hy him carriedto his capital city, Constantinople; from whence,after having lived with great virtue, she was banishedthrough the means of a false traitorous accusationof the arch-priest, whom she had severely reprimand¬ed for his imprudence in making love to her ; andthough at that time she was great with child, yetwas she compelled to leave her husband’s empire tothe great regret of Ids people, being attended onlywith a ’squire, named Blandiman, who had servedIher as a faithful servant in her brother Pepin’s courtBiflrttcebJ Teiriositn uniob ,usm * icd bliw « osi Now, after great fatigue and travel, she arrivedin the forest of Orleans, where finding her pains4come quick upon her, she dismissed the ’squire toseek her a midwife, and sat down under a great tree,expecting his arrival: but ere ho returned, she wasdelivered of two lovely children ; one of which wasconveyed away by a she-bear, which she being de¬sirous to retrieve, pursued bn her hands and knees,leaving the other to the protection of heaven. Butsee what happened ere she returned again from herfruitless pursuit. King Pepin being a hunting inthe forest, came to the tree where she left the'otherinfant: so causing it to be taken up, he ordered oneof his ’squires to put it to a nurse, who, when hegrew up, called his name Valentine. Blandiman atlength came back, and instead of finding his mis¬tress, found her brother, the king of France, at thetree, to whom he declared all that happened ; andhow his sister was banished, through the false sug¬gestions of the accursed arch-priest; which, whenking Pepin heard he was greatly enraged againstthe lady Bellifant, saying, the emperor had beentoo favourable to her, in not killing her. And soleaving Blandiman, he returned with his nobles to¬wards Paris; but the lady Bellifant. after havinglong followed the bear to no purpose, returned to¬wards the place where she laid the other babe down :but great was her sorrow, when Blandiman told herhe had seen her brother Pepin, but as to the child,he could tell nothing of it: and having comfortedher all he could for the loss of both her children,they w-ent to the sea-side, took shipping, and arriv¬ed at the castle of the giant Ferragus, in Portugal.Now all this while the bear did nourish the in¬fant among her young ones, who at length grew upto a wild hairy man, doing mischief to all thatpassed through the forest, insomuch thari he wasdreaded by the inhabitants of the adjacent towns5and villages, where we will leave him; and shallreturn to the arch-priest, who went on in doingmischief till he was impeached by a merchant, whoaccused him of having wrongfully blamed the em¬press ; whereupon they were appointed to fight at acertain time and place which was fixed by the em¬peror, in which the merchant got the better, andmade the priest confess his treason, which when theemperor heard, he was exceedingly sorrowful forhaving banished so good a consort; and wrote lettersto his brother the king of France, who read themwith great pleasure, seeing they brought the tidingsof his sister Bellifant’s innocence.CHAP. II.Valentine conquers his brother Orson, the icild man,in the forest of Orleans.Now was Valentine grown a lusty young man,and by the king greatly respected, who had asmuch care taken of him as if he had been his ownchild, commanding him to be instructed in the usoof arms, in which he became so expert, that veryfew knights in the whole court could talk with him ;which made Haufry and Henry, the king’s two bas¬tard sons, exceedingly envy him, but chiefly for thegreat affection the king bore to him. Now, at thisjuncture there were great complaints made againstthe wild man, from whom no knight had escapedwith life that had encountered with him ; thereforethe king offered a reward of one thousand marks toany person that would bring him alive or dead;which grand offer no knight was so bold as toaccept, all greatly fearing the mighty force of thewild man. Haufry and Henry desired king Pepinto send Valentine, thereby to get rid of this so6powerful a rival in the king’s favour; but hismajesty perceiving their malice, was exceedinglyangry with them, telling them at the same time,that he had rather lose the best baron in his king¬dom, than the ingenuous foundling youth Valentine.However, Valentine, to shew that he did notfear to undertake this dangerous enterprize, desiredpermission of his majesty to depart towards theforest, resolving either to conquer the- wild man, orto leave his dead carcass to be devoured by wildbeasts, with which the wood partly abounded. Ac¬cordingly having furnished himself with a very goodhorse and arms, after a day’s travel he arrived atthe forest: it being in the evening, he tied his horseto a spreading tree, and got up therein, and sleptthere that night for his greater security.Next movning early, he beheld the wild mantraversing die forest in search of prey, and atlength came to the tree where Valentine’s horsestood, which he wondered at, He began to scratchand claw, insomuch that the horse kicked at himwith great fury. The wild man feeling the painthat the kicks caused him to sutt'er, he was about totear him to pieces ; which Valentine seeing fromthe tree, made signs to him, that he would comeand fight him. So leaping down, and drawing hissword, he struck at him with great courage ; butthe wild man avoiding the stroke, caught hold ofhim by the arm, and threw him down upon theground : and then taking the shield, which Valen¬tine had dropped in the fall, he beheld it rightstrangely, in regard of the divers colours thereonemblazoned.Valentine being sore bruised, got up at last; thencame running towards his brother, thinking to smitehim with the sword ; but Orson gave back, and run-i ning to the tree, he tore it up by the roots, and thenSflew eagerly at Valentine, and Valentine at him;till at length being tired, and sore wounded, they: parted by consent to breathe: in which time, Val-ii entine looking earnestly at the wild man, made signs,that, if he would submit, be would give him allthings necessary for a rational creature.Orson, understanding that he meant his good,kneeled down, and stretched out his hands in ahumhl / posture, which greatly rejoiced Valentine,who hpund the wild man, and led him at thehorse’s tail without any resistance, carrying him toParis, to the great astonishment of the people, andpresented him to king Pepin, who greatly applaud¬ed and admired his vast courage and fortitude ; andValentine got the wild man baptized, and calledhim Orson, from his being found in a wood. Dur¬ing his stay there, Orson, with his actions, verymuch amused the whole court: but that was notlong, by reason that the duke of Aquitain had sentletters, importing, that whosoever should overthrowthe green knight, pagan champion, he should havehis daughter Fezon in marriage; from which pro¬position, Valentine took his journey to that province,attended only by his brother Orson; by which hecame to the knowledge of his parents, which youwill hereafter hear.CHAP. III.Orson and the green Knight fight, <i'c.After much travel, Valentine and Orson arrivedat the Duke of Savary’s palace in Aquitian ; andmaking known the reason which brought themthither, viz. to fight the green Knight, for the loveof the fair lady Fezon, they were kindly receivedby the duke, and presented to the lady ; to whom'Valentine spoke in the following manner. Fain .creature, king Pepin hath sent me hither with thefibravest knight in the realm, to encounter the greenknight, who, though he be dumb and naked, isfendued with such puissance and valour, that notKnight under the sun is able to wield a swordiagainst him. During which speech, the lady view--ed Orson narrowly, and he her; but supper come-ing in, interrupted them, and they all sat downto eat.Whilst they were in the midst of their feasting,the green knight entered to see the lady Fezon,according to his custom, saying, Valiant duke ofAquitian, have you any more knights to cope witlime for your fair daughter ? To whom the dukeanswered, Yes: I have now seventeen: and then icarried him into the hall, and shewed him all theknights; among whom sat Valentine and Orson.And. when he had seen them, he said to them,Lords, eat and be merry, for to-morrow will be yourlast; which Orson understanding he was greatlyincensed at him, and suddenly rising from thetable, he caught him in his arms, and swinginghim round, threw him with great force against theadjacent wall; which made the green knight lie aconsiderable time, as though he were dead, whichvery much surprised and diverted the whole com¬pany.Next day several knights were to encounter thegreen knight, but he overthrew and slew them all;till at length Orson, being armed in Valentine’sarmour, he went to the green knight’s pavilion, andhaving desired him, they began the most desperatecombat that ever was heard of. The green knightstruck such a great stroke at him, that cut off thetop of his helmet, and half his shield, sorely wound¬ed him: but this only served to enrage the valiantOrson, who coming up to him on foot, took hold ofhim; and pulling him from off his horse, gotastride of him, and was just going to kill him, butwas prevented by the sudden arrival of Valentine,to whom the green knight spake, desiring him tospare his life ; which Valentine did on the follow¬ing conditions: first, to turn Christian ; secondly,to go to Paris, and tell king Pepin, that byValentine and Orson he was overthrown in singlecombat.Having thus promised, they led him prisoner tothe city of Aquitain, where the duke received themwith great joy and triumph, and offered the ladyFezon in marriage to Orson, as his just reward.! But he by signs gave them to understand, that hewould not marry her, until his brother had won thelady Clerimond, the said green knight's sister,whom he had given to Valentine ; nor till theyhad talked to the enchanted head of brass, knewhis parents, and had gotten the use of his tongue ;which when the lady Fezon heard she was verysoiTOwful, because she loved Orson exceedingly,resolving never to have any other person for herhusband, but he who conquered the green knight.CHAP. IV.Valentine and Orson go in sear.■It of the Lady Cle-rimond, who had the Brazen Head in keeping.Now Valentine and Orson having taken leave ofthe Duke of Aquitain, and his fair daughter Fezon,prepared for their departure, and having got everything necessary, they proceeded on their journey,Ifin search of the lady Clerimond, the green knight’s10sistei, who had the keeping of the magical head ofbrass: and after many days’ travel, came to an is¬land upon which there was a tower of burnishedbrass ; to which they directed their march, andarrived at the gates, they were told it was kept byClerimond, sister to the giant Ferragus, and thegreen knight; and having demanded entrance,were refused it by the sentinel who guarded theposts ; which provoked Valentine to that degree,he ran against him with such fury, that he felledhim to the ground.The lady Clerimond beheld the combat, and see¬ing them to be brave and hardy knight’s, she receiv¬ed them very courteously ; to whom Valentinehaving pretended tokens to the green knight, toldher, that he came there for the love of her, and todiscourse with the all-knowing head concerning hisparents. So a banquet being prepared, they re¬freshed themselves plenteously : and after they hadso done, the lady taking them by the hand, ledthem into the chamber of rarities, where the headwas placed between four pillars of pure jasper.As soon as they entered, the head made the follow¬ing speech.Thou famous Knight, of royal extraction, artcalled Valentino the valiant, who of right ought tomarry the lady Clerimond, thou art son to theemperor of Greece, and the empress Bellifant, whois now in the castle of Ferragus, in Portugal, whereshe has resided these twenty years: King Pepin isthy' uncle, and the wild man thy brother; theempress Bellifant brought forth ye two in the forestof Orleans ; he was taken away by a ravenous bear,and thou wast taken up by thy uncle Pepin, whobrought thee up to man’s estate ; moreover, I like¬wise tell thee, that thy brother shall never, be able31}to speak, till thou cuttest a thread which growsunder his tongue.The head having thus ended his speech, Valentinetenderly embraced Orson, and immediately cut thethread that grew under his tongue, upon which hespake very distinctly, and related his manner ofliving in the wood. Then Valentine made the ladyClerimond turn Christian, and married her, atwhich the whole island was exceedingly rejoiced.But alas! all their joy was soon interrupted, as youshall hear.In this castle lived a dwarf, named Pacolet, whowas an enchanter, and had by his art contrived ahorse of wood, and in his forehead he fixed a pin,by turning of which, it would carry him throughthe air in a day to any part of the world. Thisenchanter, perceiving what was done in the castle,took his horse and rode to Portugal, and acquaintedthe giant Ferragus of his sister’s nuptials, and thatshe was turned to the Christian religion: whichwhen the giant heard, he was so enraged, that heswore by Mahomet that he would make her repenther transaction contrary to his pleasure. He di¬rectly got ready his fleet, and sailed towards thecastle of Clerimond; and when he arrived, heconcealed his malice from his sister and the twoKnights, telling them that he came to fetch theminto Portugal, the better to celebrate their marriage ;and that he would turn Christian at their arrivalat his castle. All which they believed, and soquickly embarked with him. When he got theminto the ship, he commanded them to be seized,and laden with irons; which so grieved his sisterClerimond, that she endeavoured to throw herselfinto the sea, but was prevented by her attendants.12CHAP. V.Pacolet comforts the two ladies, and by his artdelivers Valentine and Orson out of prison.When they were come to Portugal, he causedValentine and Orson to be put into a dungeon, andfed with bread and water only: but his sister heonly sharply rebuked, giving her the liberty of thecastle, where she met, as she was sorrowing, withthe empress Bellifant, who had lived twenty yearsin the castle of Ferragus ; she seeing her so full ofgrief, came to comfort her, enquiring the reason ; allwhich Clerimond told her, and that they were hertwo sons, Valentine and Orson, which she hadlearned from the brazen head, for which she madesuch lamentations. The empress hearing this, wasalmost struck dead with sorrow ; but Pacolet at thatinstant entering, gave them both much comfort, bypromissing to relieve Valentine and Orson thatnight, and to set them safe and out of danger ofbeing any more disturbed by the wicked PaganFerragus, which he accordingly effected in thismanner: in the dead of the night, when all thecastle was asleep, he went to the dungeon whereValentine and Orson lay bound, and touching thedoors with his magical wand, they flew open, anddiscovered the poor Knights in a very forlorn con¬dition ; but he coming to them, unloosed theirchains, and taking them by the hand, he led themto the apartment where Bellifant and Clerimondwerewho, when they saw them, were exceedinglyrejoiced: but Pacolet hindered them from discours¬ing long, by telling them they must depart ere theguards of Ferragus should awake, which would puta stop to his proceedings.13So Pacolet led them to the great gates of thescastle, which he unloosed, and then carried themito the sea-shore, where he had prepared a properIship to transport them wherever they should think^convenient; which, at Orson’s request, went toJAquitain, in order to marry Fezon, since now hehad got the use of his tongue, and found out his; parents.Next morning when Ferragus heard of their es-ucape, he was enraged to the last degree, got ready ameet and scoured the seas to take Valentine, butwas forced after a fruitless search, to return home tothis palace, whilst Valentine’s company arrived atlAqnitain, and not caring to discover themselves(to Duke Savoy, lodged themselves in private ; for[Orson knowing the inconstancy of the fair sex. hadi mind to try the lady Fezon before he married■ner ; therefore, taking the habit of a Knight-errant,mnd making Pacolet his page, he went to the DukeSavoy’s palace, and asked to be admitted into his[service ; to which the Duke answered, (not knowingOrson,) that he would accept of it very willingly,and would reward him liberally; he therefore>presented him with a purse of money, and withalnade him a champion of the court.Orson soon, by his courteous behaviour, got the• ove of every body, and was much respected by theady Fezon. who did not know him to be Orson,■ >ecause of his speech. Of these passages, Orson,ilt convenient times would acquaint Valentine,)Uerimond, and his mother Bellifant, who were;reatly rejoiced therewith ; but this joy was in-errupted by Ferragus’s proclaiming war against theii3uke of Aquitain.14e/U io eolas i£ CHAP. VII.Ferragus assembles a mighty army, and lays siegeto Aquitain ; to revenge himself of Valentine andOrion. * ,Ferragus, to be revenged of his sister Clerimondand the brave Knights, assembled all his men ofwar, and put to sea. At length arriving at Aquit¬ain, he laid siege to it, with a vast army of Saracens ;which when Duke Savoy saw, he resolved to givebattle next morning : and accordingly sallied forthwith all his forces, he himself being iu the front,and Ferragus also heading his men, when a mostbloody light ensued, which was maintained withgreat courage on both sides, for some time: theduke of Savoy being desirous of the victory, lieventured too far, and was taken prisoner; who byFerragus’s order was strongly bound, and conveyedto his tent.Now Orson was resolved to set him free, or losehis life in the attempt; and putting on the arms ofa dead Saracen, he called Pacolet: so both of themwent through the enemy’s army, without beingdiscovered, till they arrived at the tent where theduke was confined, the guards of which were castinto a deep sleep by Pacolet: which done, they tookoff the duke’s chains, and giving him a horse, herode back to the Christian army ; who, when theybeheld their Duke at liberty, cried out'—Long livethe Duke of Aquitain ! The Saracens were so soredismayed, that they fled in great confusion, whenthe Christians followed them, till night forced themto return into the city, but not till they had scarceleft Ferragus a thousand men, of all the numerousarmy he brought with him, against the Duke ofAquitain ; being obliged to return into Portugal,with the disgrace of being beat with a small armjof Christians.Soon after the victory, Valentine and Orson, the' empress Bellifant, and the ladies Clerimond andFezon, set out for Constantinople, tp see the emperorI their father ; so they took leave of the Duke ofj Savoy and all his nobles. After a long and tediousjourney, they arrived at Constantinople, and werereceived by the emperor with great solemnity, whotenderly embraced his sons, and begged pardon ofhis wife, the lady Bellifant, for having wrongfullybanished her through the wicked instigations of theArch-priest. The joy of King Pepin was no lessto see all these worthy personages met together.At length the emperor set out from Constantinople,after having taken leave of his wife Bellifant, andhis sons Valentine and Orson, to visit a strongcastle he had in Spain. Whilst he was absent,IhlUidiffer, brother to Ferragus, invaded the empire> with a great army, and at length besieged Con¬stantinople, in which city resided the empress,' Valentine and Orson, the Green Knight, and alli the ladies, besides a great number of noble warriors.Valentine seeing the deplorable condition theywere in, resolved to give Brandiffer battle, andi thereupon divided his army into ten battalions,commanded by himself, Orson, the Green Knight,and seven others of the most valiant commanders ;at the head of whom they all sallied out of the cityand began the fight with the Saracens, who stoodj drawn up in battalion, ready to receive them.Soon after, tidings came that a great fleet ofSaracens was entering the harbour, so Valentinethought it convenient to go thither, and opposetheir landing ; but it proved fatal, for this fleet wasthe emperor’s, his father; who being armed inSaracen’s arms, he by mistake ran him quitethrough the body with his spear. Orson, seeing hisfather slain, began to weep, and knowing Valentineby his armour, said to him, Alas ! brother Valentine,here is small comfort in this, for you have slain yourfather. Valentine hearing this, broke out in sucha grievous lamentation, that it grieved all hisfollowers to hear him. Alas! quoth he, what aninfamous deed have I done ! wdiat a wicked act haveI committed! I have spent my life in trouble, andnow have added murder to my other sins. Orsonseeing him thus lament, comforted him, and desiredhim to go with his army to the battle, for the Pagansin his absence had prevailed. And he desiring ahorse, mounted thereon ; and intending to lose hislife, rushed into the thickest of the battle, andmeeting a Pagan prince, ran his sword through hisbody, overthrowing all that opposed him, till hecame where the giant Brandiffer was making havockamong the chieftains: wTho when he saw him, en¬countered him so fiercely, that he fell to the ground,and Valentine giving him a stab in the groin, senthim to visit his false prophet Mahomet.The Pagans seeing their king lie dead, threwdown their arms and ran, the Christians pursuingthem with great slaughter-. At last the pursuitbeing over, they returned to Constantinople, whereOrson acquainted the empress of the death of hisfather, but would not discover by whom it wasdone : upon which it was concluded that Valentineand Orson should govern the empire by turns, to¬gether with their wives, ladies Fezon and Clerimond,whose brother, the Green Knight, was crownedking of the great mountains ; the people of whichwere greatly rejoiced in having for their king soillustrious a warrior.17In the mean time great troubles arose in France ;king Pepin being arrived there, and the twelve peersof France, from the strong castle where they hadbeen prisoners, Haufry and Henry began to plotthe death of the king and queen, and their youngson Charlemagne, whom the king made heir to thecrown and kingdom. To bring their devilish dosigns to pass, they invited the king and queen, andtheir son, to a rich banquet, but Charlemagne camenot. In the midst of the banquet, they filled a cupof deadly poison, and gave it to thp king, and theking drank to the queen, and the poison wroughtso in their bodies that they fell down dead at thetable. After that, Haufry and Henry seized on allthe strong castles and cities, but could not find theyoung prince Charlemagne, who was under hissister’s protection ; whereupon having aid from theking of England, she fought many battles success¬fully against Haufry and Henry, till they were•both slain ; and Charlemagne was crowned king,to the great joy of the whole kingdom, because heso eminently shewed forth his father’s virtue.CHAP. VIH.How Valentine, in a Pilgrim's habit, went to theIndian Court, by the name of a Doctor ; and ofhis curing a lady that was lunatic.Valentine being arrived at the city where theking of India kept his court, like a physician, tookup his lodgings at an inn in the town. His hostbegan to enquire of him, what he was, Valentinetold him that he was a physician that could cureall manner of diseases, and therefore desired him tolet his man go into the city, and post up some bills,that he might make known his art, whereby to get18something to defray his charges, which the hostconsented to. Valentine’s man having done as hewas ordered, some of the courtiers chanced to espythe bills, and reading in them that the doctor couldcure madness, declared it to the king. He sent di¬rectly for Valentine, and calling him aside, toldhim, that he had in the court a lady that was lu¬natic, for curing whom he should have a bountifulreward. Valentine attending to the king’s tale,told him, he would endeavour to restore the lady toher senses ; therefore, great sovereign ! cause a fireto be made in her chamber, and I will be with herto night, and use my skill. The king called one ofhis servants to guide Valentine to the lady’s cham¬ber, where he left him. The lady beholding him,began to throw things at him ; Valentine seeingher, said, Alas! dear lady, I am sorry to see you inthis condition; and if you will take some of mydrugs, it will bring you to your health again. Thelady looked with amaze on Valentine, seeing, byhis majestic appearance, that he seemed to be aperson of some noble family: and told him, shewould try his drug, and see if they would do herany service. Valentine prepared a dose of hismedicine and gave her, which made an effectualcure on her in a short time. The noise spreadabroad of this great performance ; but Valentine,after he got his reward from the king for curing thelady, did not choose to continue at his new employ¬ment but took farewell of the Indian court, andleft it.CHAP. IX.Valentine dies, and Orson turns hermit.Valentine being greatly troubled in mind for thedeath of his father, whom he had killed through; stake, resolved to take a pilgrimage to the holymlchre ; and calling his lady aside, he declaredi her his intention, and broke a ring in twain, andiirged her not to marry until she saw that piecethe ring again ; and said, if he did not bring itnself, he would send it when he died. After:ing leave of her, and giving the government ofe empire to his brother, he departed to the greatrrow of all, particularly liis mother Bellifant, ande fair Clerimond. Valentine after seven yearssence, returned, dressed like a poor palmer, beg-;;ng victuals at his own palace gates ; he at lengthew sick, and was like to die, and having calledr pen, ink and paper, after having put the halfng into the paper, he closed it up, and calmly laidimself down, and gave up the ghost.When Orson saw he was dead, he attempted toko the paper which he still held in his hand, butlie could not, until Clerimond came, and it thenIpened of its own accord. When she had lookedato the letter, and found the half ring, says she,ow for certain we have heard news of Valentine.Ipon reading the letter, great lamentations werelade, but especially by Clerimond. Alas, says shehave lost all my joy, my dearest lord: and toggravate my misery, that he should die so nearae and I be so insensible of it. Great preparationsrere made for his interment, which was performedtdth great magnificence at Constantinople, whereJlerimond remained a mournful widow to the endif her life.Orson after Valentine’s death, governed tne em-)ire with great wisdom and justice for seven years;jut perceiving the frail and inconstant state ofluman affairs, he gave the care of his empire, wifemd children, to the Green Knight; and then20turning hermit, he became a resident of the woodswhere, after having lived to a great age, this maj:nanimous and invincible hero surrenderedjiis bodto never-sparing death, and his soul to the immortsDeity, of whose divine attributes he had a finresemblance.Thus, Reader, you may see that none withstand,Though great in valour and of vast command,The mighty force of death's all-conquering hand.THE SOLDIER’S WIFE.,Walden was playing the flute in a slow and pensive strain, when the mournful cries of a child amthe complaining voice of a woman struck his ears.“ Oh! merciful God!” exclaimed the poor creature, “ hear with compassion the moans of m;unhappy babe!”Walden ceased to play, and looking over thhedge, he surveyed the child with compassion, athe woman lay on the grass to rest herself: Inasked her in a soft voice, why the poor infant cried“ He is hungry,” replied the woman, weepingbitterly, “ we have not had any tiling to eat sinciyesterday morning.”“ Gracious God! since yesterday morning ? waihere a few minutes, and I will return.”He flew away with incredible swiftness, and reappeared in a short time, with a bowl of milk anca small loaf, towards which the child stretched ouihis little arms, and the woman to whom he deliver¬ed them began to feed it.“ Sit down, my good woman, and eat of it your¬self,” Placing himself ou the grass beside it, hedipped a bit of the loaf in the milk, and patiently. assisted his little famished charge.The child looked up in his face, and smiled:Walden, pleased and affected at this intuitive markof gratitude, kissed its little forehead.“ What is your occupation V' he asked the woman,who was eating with avidity: “ you are I suppose,the mother of this little creature. Where do youlive?” ad vm -io orrr“ No, it is not my own,” replied she ; “ and II did not know his parents. I am the wife of a poor: soldier, my worthy sir, and I have travelled frombeyond Berlin a great way. My husband had been. away from me three years, and I wanted to see him. again—for I loved him dearly. My own two little■ children I left with their grandmother ; and I soldevery thing I did not absolutely want at home, thatI might carry him a little trifle of money. Ac¬cordingly, I set out, and got to the end of myjourney, just as my husband had marched with hiscorps, to drive a party of Austrians from some little( village ; so, when it was all over, and they haddone what they had been ordered, I ran to theplace to meet him.”Here the poor woman burst into tears. “ Andwhen I got there, he was dying of his wounds ; yethe knew me, and stretched out his hand, saying,‘Oh! Annette!—our children!’—These were hislast words :—I thought I should have died too ; butGod willed for the sake of our little ones and thisbabe, that I should live. In the same house wheremy poor husband expired, was the wife of an Au¬strian soldier, who died two days afterwards, andleft this babe, which nobody on earth seemed to careabout. Almost all the village had been burned down,and all the inhabitants had run away ; so that when22our soldiers marched 1 begged them to take the poorchild with them ; but then thay said to me—“Whatcould we do with it ?”—And that was very true ;but to let the child stay, and die with hunger, wasimpossible ; so I resolved to take it, let what wouldhappen ; and I set out, to return to my own home,with the young thing in mine arms. In my way Iwas weary enough ; but I never met with any bodythat took compassion on me or my burden, so Iwalked on ; but I fell sick, as you may see by mylooks, and spent the little money I had left, andthen I sold my clothes and every thing I couldspare—all went, except these poor rags: yet, still Ithought if I could but get home I should do verywell. I am used to bard work, and I could even dofor this little creature, who has nobody in the worldbut me to put a morsel of bread into its poor mouth;so I can’t bear to let it starve! ”As she said this, she pressed the child to herbosom, and her tears dropped upon it whilst sherepeated—“ If I was but able to work_or, I couldbut get enough to keep it till I reach my home !"“ Poor babe,” said Walden, “ poor, yet happycreature, who, in losing her who gave thee birth,found a second mother!—eyes that drop tears ofpity on thy lot, and a heart that loves thee!—No,thou shalt not from hard necessity be deserted!”Walden then wrote upon a leaf of his pocket-book the name of the woman, and that of thevillage where she informed him she lived with herfamily; and, giving her a small sum of money,promised that he would remit the same to her everyyear.The woman on beholding the gold in her hand,which had never contained so much before, ex¬claimed,—“Ob! tins is too much, worthy sir,”—23and being desired to keep it she added—“We shallnow be rich indeed!—my own little ones, and thieone, and their grandmother, we shall all be rich! ”“Good creature!” exclaimed Walden, with emo¬tion, “ you are rich indeed, in a heart to whichall other riches are dross! your humanity to thisorphan will be better rewarded; but, if this weremy last crown, you should have it.—Hasten away,or I may be tempted to take the child, to have thepleasure of bringing it up, that it may love me asit will you. ”On hearing this, the woman hastily pressed theinfant to her bosom, and giving Walden a farewellbenediction, pursued her journey with alacrity.—COMBAT BETWEEN THE HORSE ANDTHE LION,U\ ,A lliia bne ,onrfaoq arnss otlJ baviaeoiq HiJa anorlA Nobleman, in the early part of the reign ofLewis XY. having a very vicious horse, which noneof the grooms or servants would ride, (several ofthem having been thrown, and one killed,) askedleave to have him turned loose into a menagerie,against one of the largest lions. The king readilyconsented; and the animal on a certain day, wasconducted there. Soon after the arrival of thehorse, the door of the den was drawn up, and thelion with great state and majesty, marched slowlyto the mouth of it; when seeing his antagonist, heset up a tremendous roar. The horse immediatelystartled, and fell back. His ears were erected ; hismane raised ; his eyes sparkled ; and something likea general convulsion seemed to agitate his wholeframe. After the first emotion of fear had subsided,the horse retired into a corner of the menagerie,where having directed his heels towards the lion,and having reared his head back over his left should¬er. He watched with extreme eagerness the motionsof his enemy. The lion, who presently quitted hisden, sidled about for more than a minute, as ifmeditating the mode of attack; when having suf¬ficiently prepared himself for the combat, he madea sudden spring at the horse, which defended itselfby striking his adversary a most violent blow ontlic chest.The lion instantly retreated, groaned, and seemedfor several minutes inclined to give up the contest;when recovering from the painful effects of theblow, he returned again to the charge with unabatedviolence. The mode of preparation in this secondattack, was the same as the first. He sidled fromone side of the menagerie to the other for a con¬siderable time, seeking a favourable opportunity toseize upon his prey ; during all which time thehorse still preserved the same posture, and still kepthis head erected, and turned over his shoulder. Thelion, at length, gave a second spring with all thostrength and velocity he could exercise, when thehorse caught him with his hoof on the under jaw,which he fractured.Having sustained a second, and a more severerepulse than the former, the lion retreated to his denas well as he was able, apparently in the greatestagony, moaning all the way in a most lamentablemanner.What became of the lion afterwards I neverheard; but the horse was soon obliged to be shot,as no one ever dared to approach the ground wherehe w'^s kept.FINIS,

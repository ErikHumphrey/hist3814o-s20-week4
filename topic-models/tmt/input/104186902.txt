Tom nobly ranTo cheer his bride, his destin’d bride;But false report had brought to Nan,Six months before, that Tom had died.With grief she daily pin’d away,No remedy her life could save;And Tom return’d the very dayThey laid his Nancy b the grave.KATHERINE OGIE.As walking forth to view the plain.Upon a morning early,While May’s sweet scent did cheer my brain,From flowers which grew so rarely:I chanc’d to meet a pretty maid,She shin’d though it was foggie;I ask’d her name: Sweet Sir, she said,My name is Kath’rine Ogie.I stood awhile, and did admire,To see a nymph so stately;So brisk an air there did appear *In this dear maid so neatly.Such natural sweetness she display’d.Like lilies in a bogie;Diana’s self was ne’er array’dLike this same Kath’rine Ogie.Thou flower of females, Beauty’s queen,Who sees thee, sure must prize thee;Though thou art dress’d in robes but mean.Yet these cannot disguise thee:Thy handsome air, and graceful look.Excel a clownish rogie;Thou’rt match for laird, or lord, or duke,My charming Kath’rine Ogie.O were I but some shepherd swain,To feed my flock beside-thee,6At bughting-time to leave the plairi*,In milking to abide thee;I’d think myself a happier man,Wi’ Kate, my club, and doggie,Than he that hugs his thousands ten,Had I but Kath’rine Ogie.Then I’d despise the imperial throne.And statesmen’s dang’rous stations:£d he no king, I’d wear no crown,I’d smile at conquering nations;Might I caress, and still possessThis lass of whom I’m vogie;For these are toys, and still look less.Compar’d with Kath’rine Ogie.I fear the gods have not decreedFor me so fine a creature,Whose beauty rare makes her exceedAll other works of nature.Clouds of despair surround my love.That are both dark and foggie;Pity my case, ye powers above,I die for Kath’rine Ogie.YON BURN SIDE.We’ll meet beside the dusky glen, on yonburn side,Whar the hushes form a cozie den, on yon bftrnside'Tho‘ the broomy knowes be green,7Yet, there we may be seen.But we’ll meet—we’ll meet at e’en, down byyon burn side.I’ll lead thee to the birken bow’r, on yon burnside,Sae sweetly wove wi’ woodbine flow’r, on yonburn side,There the busy prying eyeNe’er disturbs the lover’s joy.While in ithers’ arms they lie, down by yonburn side.Awa’ ye rude unfeeling crew frae yon burn side,Those fairy scenes are no for you, by yon burnside;There fancy smoothes her themeBy the sweetly murm’ring stream,An« the rock-lodg‘d echoes skim, down by yonburn side.Now the planting taps are ting'd wi‘ gowd, onyon burn side.An* gloamin' draws her foggy shroud o'er yonburn side,Far frae the noisy scene,1*11 through the fields alane,There we'll meet, my ain dear Jean! down byyon burn side.8TKE ROSE-TREE.A Rose tree in full bearing,Had sweet flowers fair to see;One Rose beyond coaiparing,For beauty attracted me:Tho‘ eager once to win it,Lovely, blooming, fresh and gay,I find a canker in it.And now throw it far away.How fine this morning early,The sun shining clear and bright,So late I lov‘d you dearly,Tho’ lost now each fond delight.The clouds seem big with showers,Sunny beams no more are seen;Farewell ye happy hours.Your falsehood has chang‘d the sceneFINIS.

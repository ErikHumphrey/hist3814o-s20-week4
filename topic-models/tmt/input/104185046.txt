THEM adrid Shaver’sAIJVEMTURESIN THESPANISHINQUISITION'.OJFALKIRK:PRINTED FOR THE BOOKSELLERS.•\The Madrid Shaver.NICOLAS PEDROSA, a busy little being, whofollowed the trade of shaver, surgeon, and man-midwife in the town of Madrid, mounted his muleat the door of his shop in the Plazuela de losAffligidos, and pushed through the gate of SanBernardino, being called to a patient in a neigh¬bouring village of Foncarral, upon a pressing occa¬sion. Every body knows, that the ladies in Spain,in certain cases, do not give long warning to prac¬titioners of a certain description, and nobody knewit better than Nicolas, who was resolved not tolose an inch of his way, nor of his mule’s best speedby the way, if cudgelling could beat it out of her.It was plain to Nicolas’s conviction, as plain couldbe, that his road lay ■ straight forward to the lit¬tle convent in front; the mule was of opinion,that the turning on the left down the hill towardsthe Prade, was the road of all roads most fami¬liar and agreeable to herself, and accordingly be¬gan to dispute the point of topography with Ni¬colas, by fixing her forefeet resolutely in theground, dipping her head at the same time be¬tween them, and launching heels and crupperfuriously into "the air, in the way of argument.Little Pedrosa, who was armed at heel with onemassy silver spur, of stout though ancient work¬manship, resolutely applied the rusty rowel to3the shoulder of the beast, and at the same time,adroitly tucking his blue cap under his right arm,ancT flinging his skirt over his left shoulder en ca¬valier, began to lay about him with a stout ashensapling, upon the ears, pole, and cheeks, of therecreant mule. The fire now flashed from apair of Andalusian eyes, as black as charcoal, andnot less inflammable, and taking the segara fromhis mouth, with which he had v^'nly hoped tohave regaled his nostrils in a sharp winter’s even¬ing by the way, raised such a thundering troopof angels, saints, and martyrs, from Saint Mi¬chael, downwards, not forgetting his own name¬sake St. Nicolas de 1 olentino, by the way, thatif curses could have made the mule to go, thedispute would have been soon ended ; but not asaint could make her stir any other ways thanupwards and downwards at a stand. A smalltroop of mendicant friars were at this momentconducting the host to a dying man ‘ NicolasPedro<a,’ said an old friar, ‘ be patient with yourbeast, and spare your blasphemies; rememberBalaam.’—‘ Ah ! father,’ replied Pedrosa, ‘ Ba¬laam cudgelled bis beast till she spoke, so will Imine till she roars.’—‘ Fie, lie, prophane fellow,’cries another of the fraternity. ‘ Go about yourwork, friend,’ quoth Nicolas, ‘ and let me goabout mine; I warrant it is the more pressing ofthe two ; your patient is going out of the world,and mine is coming into it.’ ‘ Hear him,’ cries athird, ‘ hear the vile wretch how he blasphemes thebody of God.’ And then the troop passed slowlyon to the tinkling of the bell.A man must know nothing of a mule’s ears,4.who dors not know what a passion they have forthe tinkling of a bell; and no sooner had thejungling chords vibrated in the sympathetic or¬gans of Pedrosa’s beast, then bolting forwardwith a sudden spring, she ran roaring into thethrong of friars, trampling on some, and shoul¬dering others, at a prophane rate; when Nicolasavailing himself of the impetus, and perhaps notable to control it, broke away, and was out ofsight in a moment. ‘ All the devils in hell blowfire into thy tail, thou beast of Babylon, mutteredNicolas to himself, as he scampered along, neveronce looking behind him, or stopping to apologizefor the mischief he had done to the bare feet andshirtless ribs of the holy brotherhood.Whether Nicolas saved his distance, as like¬wise if he did, whether it was a male or a fe¬male Castilian he ushered into the w'orld, weshall not just now enquire, contented to awaithis return in the first of the .morning, next day,when he had no sooner dismounted at his shop,and delivered his mule to a sturdy Arragonesewench, than Don tgnacia de Santos Aparicio,Alguazil-mayor of the supreme and general In¬quisition, put an order into his hand, signed andsealed by the Inquisitor-general, for a convey¬ance of his body to the Casa, whose formidabledoor presents itself in the street adjoining to thesquare in which Nieoias’s brazen basin hung from,the emblem of his trade.The poor little fellow, trembling in every joint,and with a face as yellow as saffron, dropt a kneeto the alter which fronts the entrance, and cros¬sed himself most devotely: as soon as he had as-5cended the first flight of stairs, a porter habitedin black opened, the tremendous barricade, andNicolas, with horror, heard the grating of theheavy bolts that shut him in. He was ledthrough passages and vaults, and melancholycells, till he was delivered into the dnngeon,where he was finally left to his solitary medita¬tions. Hapless being ! what a scene of horror !Nicolas felt all the terrors of his condition, butbeing an Andalusi <n, and, like hi> countrymen,of a lively imagination, he began to turn over allthe resources of his invention for some happyfetch, if any such might occur, for helping himout of the dismal limbo he was in: he had notlong to seek tor the cause of his misfortune ; hisadventure with the barefooted friars was a readysolution of all difficulties of that nature, had therebeen any ; there was, however, another thing,which might have troubled a stouter heart thanNicolas’s—he was a Jew. 'Ihis, of a certain,would have been a staggering item in a poordevil's confession, but then it was a secret to allthe world but Nicolas, and Nicolas’s consciencedid not then urge him to reveal it. He now be¬gan to overhaul the inventory of his personalsabout him, and with some satisfaction countedthree little medals of the blessed Virgin, twoAgnus Deis, a Saint Nicolas de Tolentino, anda formidable string of beads, all pendant fromhis neck, and within his shirt; in his pockets hehad a paper of dried figs, a small bundle of se-gars, a case of lancets, squirt and forceps, andtwo old razors in a leathern envelope: these hehad delivered one by one to the algunzil, whofirst arrested him,—‘ and let them make the mostof them,’ said he to himself, ‘ they can neverprove an Israelite by a case of razors.’ Upon acloser rummage, however, he discovered in asecret pocket, a letter, which the Alguazil hadoverlooked, and which his patient Donna Leon¬ora de Casafonda had given him in charge to de¬liver as directed.—‘ *Vell, well,’ ciied he, ‘let itpass; there can be no mystery in this harmlessscrawl; a letter of advice to some friend or rela¬tion; I’ll not break the seal; let the fathers readit, if they like, ’twill prove the truth of my de¬position, and help out my excuse for the hurryof my errand, and the unfortunate adventure ofa damned refractory mule.’—And now no soonerhad the recollections of the wayward mule cros¬sed the brain of poor Nicolas Pedrosa, than hebegan to blast her at a furious rate. ' ‘ The scrat¬ches and the scab to boot confound thy scurvyhide,’ quoth he, ‘ thou ass-begotton bastard,whom Noah never let into his ark ! The ven¬geance take thee, fqr an uncreated barren beastof promiscuous generation ! What devil’s crot¬chet got into thy capricious noddle, that thoushouldst fall in love with that Nazaritish bell,and run bellowing like Lucifer into the midst ofthose barefooted vermine who were more malici¬ous and more greedy than the locusts of Egypt?Oh! that I had the art of Simon Magus to con¬jure thee into this dungeon in my stead; but Iwarrant thou art chewing thy barley straw with¬out any pity for thy wretched master, whom thyjade’s tricks have delivered bodily to the tormen¬tors, to be sport for these uncircumcised sons ofDagpn.’ And now die cell door opened, whena savage figure entered, carrying a'huge parcelof clanking fetters, with a collar of iron, whichlie put round the neck of poor Pedrosa, tellinghim, with a truly diabolical grin, whilst he wasrivelting it on, ‘ that it was a proper cravet forthe throat of a blasphemer.’—‘ Jesus Maria !’quoth Pedrosa, ‘is all this fallen upon me, foronly cudgelling a restive mule ?’ ‘ Aye,’ criedthe demon, ‘and this is only a tgste of what isto come,’ at the same time slipping the pincersfrom the screw he was forcing to the head, hecaught a piece of flesh in the forceps, and wrench¬ed it out of his cheek, laughing at poor Nicolas,whilst he roared out with the pain, telling him‘ it was a just rewaid for the torture he had puthim to a while ago, when he tugged out a toothtill he broke it in his jaw.’ ‘ Ah, for the loveof heaven,’ cried Pedrosa, ‘ have more p'ty onme; for the sake of Saint Nicolas de Tolentino,my holy patron, be not so unmerciful to a poorbarber-surgeon ; and I w ill shave your worship’sbeard for nothing as long as I have life.’ One ofthe messengers of the auditory now came in, andbade the fellow strike off the prisoner’s fetters,for that the holy fathers were in council, and de¬manded him for examination. ‘ This is some¬thing extraordinary,’ quoth the tormentor, ‘ Ishould not have expected it this twelvemonth tocome.’ Pedrosa’s fetters were struck off; somebrandy was applied to staunch the bleeding of hischeek; his hands and face were washed, and ashott jacket of coarse ticking thrown over him;and the messenger, with an assistant, taking him8each under an arm, led him into a spacious cham¬ber, where at the head of a long table sat his ex¬cellency the Inquisidor-geheral, with six of his as¬sessors, three on each side of the chair of state :the Alguazil-mayor, a secretary, and two notaries,with other officers of the holy council, were at¬tending in their places.The prisoner was placed behind a bar at thefoot of the table, between the messengers whobrought him irf; and having made his obesianceto the awful presence, in the most supplicatingmanner, he was called upon, according to theusual form of question, by one of the juniorjudges’, to declare his name, parantage, profes¬sion, age, place of abode, and to answer variousinterrogatories, of'the like trifling nature : his Ex-cel'eney the Inquisidor-general now opened hisreverend lips, and in a solemn tone of voice, thatpenetrated to the heart of the poor trembling pris¬oner, interrogated him as follows :Nicolas Pedros’, we have listened to the ac¬count you give of \ ourself your business, ami con-nectior s ; now tell us for what offence or offen¬ces, you arc here standing a prisoner before us;examine your heart, and speak the truthfrom your conscience without prevarication ordisguise.May it please your excellency, rep'ied Pedro¬sa, with all due submission to your holiness andthis reverend assembly, my most equitable judges,I conceive I stand here before you for no worsea crime than that of cudgelling a refractory mule,an animal'so restive in its naturej (under correc¬tion of your holiness be it spoken;) that although9I were blessed with the forbearance of holy Job(for like him too I am married, and my patiencehath been exercised by a wife,) yet could I notforbear to smite my beast for her obstinacy, andthe rather because I was summoned in the wayof my profession, as I have already made knownto your most merciful ears, upon a certain cry¬ing occasion, which would not admit of a moment’sdelay.Recollect yourself, Nicolas, said his Excellencythe Inquisidor-general ; w'as there nothing else youdid, save smiting your beast"I take Saint Nicolasde Tolentino to witness, re¬plied he, that 1 know of no other crime, for whichI can be responsible at this righteous tribunal,save smiting my unruly beast. fake notice,brethren, exclaimed the Inquisidor, this unholywretch holds trampling over friars to be nocrime. 'Pardon me, holy father, replied Nicolas, 1 holdit for the worst of crimes, and therefore willinglysurrender my refractory mule to be dealt with asyou see fit; and if you impale her alive, it willbe no more than she deserves.Your wits are to nimble, Nicolas, cried thejudge ; have a care they do not run away withyour discretiop ; recollect the blasphemies youuttered in the hearing of those pious people.I humbly pray your Excellency, answered theprisoner, to recollect that anger is a short mad¬ness, and I hope allowances will be made byyour holy council for words spoke in haste to arebellious mule: the prophet Balaam was thrownoff his guard by a simple ass, and what is an ass10’compared to a mule? If your Excellency hadseen the lovely creature that was screaming inagony till I came to her relief, and how fine aboy I ushered into the world, which would havebeen lost but for my assistance, I am sure I shouldnot be condemned for a few hasty words spokenin passion.Sirrah! cried one of the puisne judges, respectthe decency of the court. Produce the contentsof the fellow’s pockets before the court, said thepresident; lay them on the table.Monster! resumed the aforesaid puisne judge,taking up the forceps, what is the use of thisdiabolical machine? Please your reverence, re¬plied Pedrosa, ' a plum est ad extrahendos foetus.’—Unnatural wretch, again exclaimed the judge,you have murdered the mother.The mother of God forbid! exclaimed Pedro¬sa. I believe I have a proof in my pocket thatwill acquit me of that charge , and so saying, hetendered the letter we have before made mentionof. The secretary took it, and by command ofthe court read as follows :—“ Senior Don Manuel de Herr err a,“ When this letter, which I send by NicolasPedrosa, shall reach your hands, you will knowthat l am safely delivered of a lovely boy, aftera dangerous labour, in consideration of which Ipray you to pay to the said Nicolas Pedrosa thesum of twenty gold pistoles, which sum his Ex¬cellency—.”Hold, cried the Inquisitor-general, startinghastily from his seat, and snatching away the let¬ter, there is more in this than meets the eye:11break up the court; I must take an examination ofthis prisoner in private.As soon as the room was eieared, the Inquisi¬tor-general, beckoning to the prisoner to followhim, and retired into a private closet, where, throw¬ing himself carelessly into an arm chair, he turn¬ed a gracious countenance upon the poor affright¬ed accoucheur, and bidding him sit down upona low stool by his side, thus accosted him .—Take heart, Senior Pedrosa, your imprisonmentis not likely to be very tedious, for I have a com¬mission you must execute without loss of time:you have too much consideration for yourself tobetray a trust, the violation of which must in¬volve you in inevitable ruin, and can in no degreeattaint my character, which is far enough be¬yond the reach of malice ; be attentive, therefore,to my orders; execute them punctually and keepmy secret as you tender your own life: dost thouknow the name and condition of the lady whomthou hast delivered? Nicolas assured him hedid not. and his Excellency proceeded as follows:Then I tell thee, Nicolas, it is the illustriousDonna Leonora de Casafonda; her husband isthe president of Quito, and daily' expected withthe next arrivals from the South Seas: new,though measures have been taken for detaininghim at the port, where he shall land, till he shallreceive further orders, yet you must be sensibleDonna Leonora’s situation is somewhat delicate ;it will be your business to take the speediestmeasures for her recovery; but as it seems shehas had a dangerous and painful labour, this maybe a work of more time than could be wished,12unless some medicines more efficacious than com¬mon are administered; art thou acquainted withany such, friend Nicolas ?—So p^ase your Ex¬cellency, quoth Nicolas, my posesses have beentolerably successful; I have bandages arid cata-psalms, with oils and conserves, that I have nocause to complain of; they will restore nature toifcs proper state in all decent time.— I hou taikestlike a fool, friend Nicolas, interrupting him, saidthe Inquisitor ? What tellest thou me pf thyswathings and swaddlings? quick work must bewrought by quick medicine: base thou none suchin thy botica ? I’ll answer for it thou hast not ;therefore, look you, sirrah, here is a little vialcompounded by a famous chemist ; see that youmix it in the next apocem you administer toDonna Leonora ; it is the most capital sedativein nature; give her the w hole of it, and let herhusband return when he will, depend upon it hewill make no discoveries from her.— Humph !quoth Nicolas within himself, well said Inquisi-dor ! He took the vial w ith all possible respect,and was not wanting, in professions of the mostinviolable fidelity and secrecy.— No more wordsfriend Nicolas, quoth the Inquisidor, upon thatscore; I do not believe thee one jot the more forall thy promises, my dependence is upon thyfears and not thy faith ; I fancy thou hast seenenough of this place not to be w illing to returnto it once for all! Having so said, he rang abell, and ordered Nicolas to be forthwith liber¬ated, bidding the messenger return his clothesinstantly to him with all that belonged to himand having slipt a purse into his hand well filled13with doubloons, he bade him begone about hisbusiness, and not see his face again till he hadexecuted his demands,Nicolas bolted out of the porch without takingleave of the alter, and never checked his speedtill he found himself fairly housed under shelter©f his own beloved brass bason.— Aha! quothNicolas, my lord Inquisidor, I see the king isnot likely to gain a subject more by your intrigues:a pretty job you have set me about; and so,when I have put the poor lady to rest with yourdamned sedative, my tongue must be stopt nextto prevent its blabbing : but I’ll shew you I wasnot born in Andalusia for nothing. Nicolas nowopened a secret drawer, and took out a fewpieces of money, which, in fact, was his wholestock of cash in the world ; he loaded and primedhis pistols, and carefully lodged them in the hou-sers of his saddle ! he buckled to his side histrusty spada, and hastened to caparison his mule.Ah, thou imp of the old one, quoth he, as heentered the stable, art not ashamed to look mein the face ? But come, hussy, thou owest mea good turn, methinks ; stand by me this once,and be friends for ever! thou art in good case,and if thou wilt put thy best foot foremost, likea faithful beast, thou shall not want for barleyon the way. The bargain was soon struck be¬tween Nicolas and his mule, he mounted her inthe happy moment, and pointing his course to¬ward the bridge of Toledo, which proudly strideswith half a dozen lofty arches over a streamscarce three feet wide, he found himself as com¬pletely in a desart in half a mile's riding, as if heuhad been dropt in the centre of Arabia Petraea.As Nicolas’s journey was not a tour of curiosity,he did not amuse himself with a peep at Toledo,or Talavera, or even Merida by the way; forthe same reason he took a circumbendibus roundthe frontier town of Badajoz; and crossing alittle brook, refreshed his mule with the lastdraught of Spanish water, and instantly congra¬tulated himself upon entering the territory ofPortugal. Brava! quoth he, patting the neckof his mule, thou shall have a supper this uightof the best sive-meat that Estramadura can fur¬nish : we are now in a country where the scat¬tered flock of Isael fold thick and fare well. Henow began to chaunt the Song of Solomon, andgently ambled on in the joy of his heart.When Nicolas at length reached the city ofLisbon, he hugged himself in his good fortune;still he recollected that the Inquisition had longarms, and he was yet in a place of no perfectsecurity. Our adventurer had in early life actedas assistant-surgeon in a Spanish frigate bound toBuenos-Ayres, and been captured by a Britishman-of-war, and carried into Jamaica, had veryquietly passed some years in that place as jour¬neyman apothecary, in which time he had ac¬quired a tolerable acquaintance with the Englishlanguish. No sooner then did he discover theBritish ensign flying on the poop of an Englishfrigate then lying in the Tagus, than he eagerlycaught the opportunity of paying a visit to thesurgeon; and finding he was in want of a mate,offered himself, and was entered in that capacityfor a cruize against the French and Spaniards,15with whom Great Britain was then at war. Inthis secure asylum Nicolas enjoyed the first hap¬py moments he had experienced for a long timepast, and being a lively good natured little fel¬low, and one that touched the guitar and sungsequidillas with a tolerable grace, he soon re¬commended himself to his ship-mates, and grewin favour with every body on board, from thecaptain to the cook’s mate.When they were out upon their cruize, hover¬ing on the Spanish coast, it occurred to Nicolas,that the Inquisitor-general at Madrid had toldhim of the expected arrival of the president ofQuito, and having imparted this to one of thelieutenants, he reported it to the captain; andas the intelligence seemed of importance, heavailed himself of it, by bawling into the trackof the homeward-bound galleons, and great wasthe joy, when at the break of the morning theman at the mast-head announced a square-riggedvessel in view. The ardour of a chace now setall hands at work ; and a feM hours brought themnear enough to discern that she was a Spanishfrigate, and seemingly from a long voyage : littlePedrosa, as alert as the rest, stript himself forhis work, and repaired to his post in the cock¬pit, whilst the thunder of the guns reeled inces¬santly over his head ; three cheers from the wholecrew at length announced the moment of victory,arid a few more minutes ascertained the goodnews, that the prize was a frigate richly ladenfrom the South Seas, with the governor of Quitoand his suite on board.Pedrosa was now called upon deck, and sent16on board the prize as inletpreter to tlie first lieu¬tenant, who was to take posession of her.— Hefound every thing in confusion, a deck coveredwith the slain, and the whole crew in consterna¬tion at an event they were in no degree prepaaedfor, not having received any intimation of a war.He found the officers in general, and the passen¬gers without exception, under the most horridimpressions of the English, expecting to be but¬chered without mercy. Don Manuel de Casa-fonda, the governor, whose countenance bespokea constitution far gone in a decline, had thrownhimself on a sofa, in the last state of despair, andgiven wav to an effusion of tears : when the lieu¬tenant entered the cabin he rose trembling fromhis couch, and with the most supplicating action,presented to him his sword, and with it a casketwhich he carried in his other hand : as he ten¬dered these spoils to his conqueror, whetherthrough his weakness, or of his own will, hemade a motion of bending his knee: the gener¬ous Briton, shocked at the unmanly overture,caught him suddenly with both hands, and turn¬ing to Pedroso, said aloud,—Convince this gen¬tleman he is fallen into the hands of an honour¬able enemy.—Is it possible ! cried Don Manuel,and lifting up his streaming eyes to the counte¬nance of the British officer, saw humanity, valour,and generous pity, so strongly characterized in hisyouthful features, that the conviction was irre-sistable. Will he not accept my sword ? criedthe Spaniard. 1 le desires you to wear it, till hehas the honour of presenting you to his captain.Ah ! then he has a captain, exclaimed Don Ma-H-17nuel, his superior will be of another "way ofthinking; tell him this ' casketfcontains my jew¬els ; they are valuable; let him present them asa lawful prize, which will enrich the captor; hissuperior will not hesitate to take them from me.— If they are your excellency’s private property,replied Predrosa, I am ordered to assure you, thatif your ship were loaded with jewels, no Britishoffiber in the service of his king will take themat your hands; the ship and effects of his Catho¬lic Majesty are the only prize of the captors ; thepersonals of the passengers are inviolate.—Gen¬erous nation ! exclaimed Don Manuel, howgreatly have I wronged thee !—The boats of theBritish frigate now came alongside, and part ofthe crew were shifted out of the prize, takingtheir clothes and trunks along with them, inwhich they were Very cordially assisted by theirconquerors. The barge soon after came aboard -with an officer in the stern-sheefs, and the crewin their white' Shirts and velvet caps, to escort thegovernor and the ship's captain on board the fri¬gate, wliibh lay with her sails to the mast, await¬ing their arrival: the accommodation-ladder wasslung over the side, and manned for the prison¬ers, who Were received on the gang-way hy thesecond lieutenant, whilst perfect silence and thestrictest discipline reigned in the ship, where allwere under thb deck^, and no inquisitive curiouseyes were suffered to wound the feelings of theconquered even with a glance. In the door ofbis cabin stood the captain, who received themwith that modest complaisance, which does notrevolt the unfortunate by an overstrained polite-18ness: ha was a man of high, birth and elegantmanners, with a heart as benevolent as it wasbrave: such an address, set off with a personfinely formed and perfectly engaging, could notfail to impress the prisoners with the most fav¬ourable ideas; and as Don Manuel spoke Frenchfluently, he could converse with the British Cap¬tain without the help of an interpreter: as heexpressed an impatient desire of being admittedto his parole, that he might revisit his friendsand connections, from whom he had been longseparated, he was overjoyed to hear that theEnglish ship would carry her prize into Lisbon ;and that he would there be set on shore, and per¬mitted to make the best of his way from thenceto Madrid. He talked of his wife with all theardour of the most impassioned lover, and apo¬logized for his tears, by imputing them to theagony of his mind and infirmity of his health,under the dread of being longer separated froman object so dear to his heart, and on whom hefloated with the fondest affection. The gener¬ous captain indulged him in these conversations,and being a husband himself, knew how to al¬low for all the tenderness of his sensations Ah,Sir, cried Don Manuel, would to heaven it werein my power to have the honour of presentingmy beloved Leonora to you on our landing atLisbon.— Perhaps, added he, turning to Pedrosa,who at that moment entered ihe cabin, this gen¬tleman, whom I take to be a Spaniard, may haveheard the name of Donna Leonora de Casafonda;if he has been at Madrid, it is possible he mayhave seen her; should that be the case, he can.19testify to her external charms; I alone can wit¬ness to the exquisite perfections of her mind.—Senior Don Manuel, replied Pedrosa, I have seenDonna Leonora, and your Excellency is warrant¬ed in all you can say in her praise; she is of in¬comparable beauty. These words threw the ux¬orious Spaniard into raptures; his eyes sparkledwith delight; the blood rushed into his emaciatedcheeks, and every feature glowed with unutter¬able joy: he presjsed Pedrosa with a variety ofrapid enquiries, all which he evaded by pleadingignorance, saying that he had only a casual glanceof her as she passed along the Prado. The em¬barrassment, however, which accompanied theseanswers, did not escape the English captain, who,shortly after, drawing Pedrosa aside into the sur¬geon’s cabin, was by him made acquainted withthe melancholy situation of that unfortunate lady',and every particular of tne story as before related ;nay, the very vial was produced, with its con¬tents, as put into the bauds of Pedrosa by theInquisitor.Can there be such villainy in man ? cried theBritish captain, when Pedrosa had concluded hisdetail: alas! my heart bleeds for this unhappyhusband ; assuredly that monster has destroyedLeonora ; as for thee, Pedrosa, whilst the Brit¬ish flag flies over your head, neither Spain, norPortugal, nor Inquisitors, nor devils, shall annoythee under its protection ; but if thou ever ven¬tures! over the side of this ship, and rashly set-test thy foot upon Catholic sod, when we arriveat Lisbon, thou art a lost man.—I were worsethan a madman, replied Nicolas, should I at-20tempt it.—Keep close in this asylum, then, re¬sumed the captain, and fear nothing : had it beenour fate to "have been captured by the Spaniard,what would have become of thee Jn the worseof extremities, replied Nicolas, I should haveapplied to the Inquisitor’s vial; but I confess Ihad no fears of that sort; a ship so commandedand so manned is in little danger of being car¬ried into a Spanish port,—-I hope not, said thecaptain, and I promise thee, thou shall take thychance in her as long as she is afloat under mycommand; and if we live to conduct her to Eng¬land, thou shall have thy proper share of prize-money, which, if the galleon breaks up accord¬ing to her entries, will be something towardsenabling thee to shift, and if thou art as diligentin thy calling, as I am persuaded thou wilt be,whilst I live thou shall never want a seaman’sfriend.— At these cheering words, little Nicolasthrew himself at the feet of his generous preserv¬er, and with streaming eyes, poured out histhanks from a heart animated with joy and gra¬titude.— The captain raising him by the hand,forbade him as he prized his friendship, ever toaddress him in that posture any more ; thank me,if you will, added he, but thank me as one manshould another: let no knee bend in this shipbut in adoration of God But now, continuedhe, let us turn our thoughts to the situation ofour unhappy Casafonda: we are now' drawingnear Lisbon, where he will look to be liberatedon his parole. By no means let him venture in¬to Spam, said Pedrosa; I am well assured thereare orders to arrest him in every port, or frontier21town where he may present himself. I can wellbelieve it, replied the captain ; his piteous casewill require further deliberation; in the meantime, let nothmg transpire on your part; andkeep yourself out of his sight as carefully as youcan—This said, the captain left the cabin, andboth parties repaired to their several occupations.As soon as the frigate and her prize castanchor in the Tagus, Don Manuel de Casafondaimpatiently reminded our captain of his promisedparole. The painful moment was now come,when an explanation of some sort became un¬avoidable: the generous Englishman, with acountenance expressive of the tenderest pity, tookthe Spaniard’s hand in his, and seating him ona couch beside him, ordered the centinel to keepthe caoin private, and deliverad himself as fol¬lows:—Senior Don Manuel, I must now impart toyou an anxiety which I labour under on your ac¬count ; 1 have strong reasons to suspect you haveenemies in your own country, who are upon thewatch to arrest you on your landing; when Lhave told you this, 1 expect you will repose suchtrust in my honour, and the sincerity of my re¬gard for you, as not to demand a further expla¬nation of the particulars on w hich my intelligenceis founded.— Heaven and earth ! cried the as¬tonished Spaniard, who can be those enemies [have to fear, and what can I have done to de¬serve them ! So far I will open myself to you,answered the qaptain, as to point out the princi¬pal to you, the inquisitor-general. The bestfriend I have in Spain, exclaimed the Governor,my sworn protector, the patron of my fortune;he my enemy! impossible. Well, Sir, repliedthe captain, if my advice do not meet belief, Imust so far exert my authority for your sake, asto make this ship your prison, till I have waitedon our minister at Lisbon, and make the enqui¬ries necessary for your safety; suspend yourjudgment upon the seeming harshness of thismeasure till I return to you again; and, at thesame time, rising from his seat he gave orders forthe barge; after leaving strict injunctions with thefirst lieutenant not to allow of the governor’s quit¬ting the frigate, he put off for the shore.The emissaries of the Inquisition having at lasttraced Pedrosa, our captain had no sooner turn¬ed into the porch of the hotel of Buenos-Ayres,thsn he was accosted by a messenger of state,with a requisition for the surrender of Pedrosa.As soon as this requisition was explained to ourworthy captain, he dispatched the midshipman,to make the best of his way back to the frigate,and deliver a letter to the lieutenant; then turn¬ing to the messenger, he said. That Spaniard isnow borne on my books, and before you shalltake him out of the service of my king you mustsink his ship. He instantly proceeded to thehouse of the British Minister: here he foundPedrosa’s intelligence, with regard to the Gover¬nor, expressly verified.The generous captain lost no time in returningto his frigate, where he immediately imparted toDon Manuel the intelligence he had obtained atthe British Minister’s. The proposal was nowsuggested of sending letters into Spain, and the23governor retired to his desk for the purpose ofwriting them. In the afternoon of the same day,the Minister paid a visit to the captain, and re¬ceived a packet from the hands of Don Manuel,promised to get forwarded by a safe conveyanceaccording to the direction.In due course of time, this fatal letter fromLeonora opened all the horrible transactions to thewretched husband:—“ The guilty hand of an expiring wife, underthe agonizing operation of a mortal poison, tracesthese few trembling lines to an injured, wretchedhusband. If thou hast any pity for my partingspirit, 11} the ruin that awaits thee, and avoidthis scene of viliainy and horror. I have borne achild to the monster, whose poison runs in myveins. The Inquisitor is my murderer.— My penfalls from my hand Farewell for ever !”Had a shot passed through the heart of DonManuel, it could not more effectually have stoptits motions than the perusal of this fatal writing:he dropped lifeless on the couch, and but for thecare and assistance of the captain and Pedrosa,in that posture he had probably expired. Grieflike his cannot be described by words, for to wordsit gave no utterance; ’twas suffocating, silentwoe.Let us drop the curtain over this melancholypause in our narration, and attend upon themournful widower, now landed upon Englishground, and conveyed by his humane and gener¬ous preserver to the house of a noble Earl, thefather of our amiable captain. At the period ofa few tranquillizing weeks, here passed in the24bosom of humanity, letters came to hand from theBritish Ministers at Lisbon, in answer to a memo¬rial, that I should have stated to have been drawnup by the friendly captain before his departurefrom that port. By these letters it appeared, thatthe criminal was either no longer in existence, orin a situation never to be heard of any more, tillroused by the awakening trump, he should besummoned to his tremendous last account. Asfor the unhappy widower, it was fully signified tohim, from authority, that his return to Spain,whether upon exchange or parole, would be nolonger opposed; nor had he any thing to appre¬hend on the part of government, when he shouldarrive there. The same was signified in fewerwords to the exculpated Pedrosa.Whether Don Manuel de Casafonda will, at afuture period, avail himself of the overtures, timealone can prove: as for little Nicolas, whoseprize-money has set him up in a comfortable littleshop in Duke's-place, where he breathes theveins and cleanses the bowels of his Israelitishbrethren, in aland of freedom and toleration. Hismerry heart is at rest, save only when, with firein his eye*, and vengeance on his tongue, heanathematizes the Inquisition: and struts in thesynagogue every Sabbath, with as bold a stepand as erect a look, as if he was himself HighPriest of the Temple, going to perform sacrificesupon the re-assembling of the scattered tribes.FINIS.

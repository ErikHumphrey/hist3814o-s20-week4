O Allan! I’m indebted to thee,It’s a debt dear Allan, I never can pay,0 Allan! O Allan! how came you for me?Sure I am not worthy your bride for to be.How call you me Allan, when Sandy’s my name?Why call you me Allan iSure you are to blame;Kor don’t you remember when at school with thee,1 a ns hated by all the rest but loved by thee.(JHow oft hare I fed on your bread and your eheeae,Likewise when you had but a handful of pease,Your cruel-hearted father hound at me his dogs,They tore my bare heels, and rave all my rags.Is this my dear Sandy whom I loved so dear ?I have not heard of you this many a. year;When all the rest went to bed, sleep waafiae me,For thinking what was become of thee.My parents were born lang before me,Perhaps by this time they are drowned in the sea,These lands and possessions they left them to me,And I came for thee, jewel, to share them with thee.In love we began, and in love we will end.And in joy and mirth our days wo will spend;And a voyage to your father once more we will go,And relieve the old farmer from his trouble and"woe.'With men and maid-servants to wait them upon,Away to her father in a chaise they are gone;The laddie wont foremost—the brave Highland forth,Till they came to the road that leads to the town.When he came to the gate bo gave a loud roar,—Come down gentle farmer, Catherine’s at your door.When he looked out at the window he saw hi*daughter’s face,With his hat in his hand he made a great phrase.Keep on your rml, larmer, don’t lot it fa’,For it sets not the peacock to bow to the crow.It’s hold your tongue, Sandy, and do not raunt me,For my daughter’s not worthy y our bride for to bo.7iSon he held his bridle reins till he ceme down.And then he conveyed him to s fine room :With rejoicing and fensting the time flew away,And the father and son lived in friendship for aye.THE CROOK AND PLAID.If lassies love the laddies, they surely should confest,For every lassie has a lad she loes aboon the rest,He’s dearer to his bosom whatever be his trade,And through life I’ll loe the laddie that wears theCrook and Plaid.He’s aye true to his lover, aye true to me.He climbs the mountain early, his fleecy flocks to view,He spies the little laverocks spring out frae ’mang thsdew;His faithful little doggie, so frolicsome and glad,Wanders forward with the laddie that wears theCrook and Plaid.For he’s, &c.He pu’s the blooming heather, lie git’s the lily meek,Calls the lily like my bosom, the heather like mycheck;His words are aye so tender, my hcnrl is aye so glad,There’s nae wooer like the laddie that wears theCrook and Plaid. . y-For he’s, &o,6I winna hae the laddie that ca's the cart and plough,Although he may be tender, although he may be trueBut I will hae the laddie that has my heart betrayed,He’s the faithful shepherd laddie, that wears theCrook and Plaid.For he’s, &c.It's down beside the hawthorn that blooms in yondervale,Pll meet him in the gloaming far frae the noisy gale,Bis words are aye so tender, my heart is aye so glad,For he kens the way sae nicely to row me in his plaidFor he’s Ac.<v To such a faithful lover, oh who would not comply!True love gives greater pleasure than aught beneaththe sky.If love be in your bosom my heart can ne’er be sad.And through life I'll loe the laddie that wears th#Crook and Plaid.For he’s Ao.

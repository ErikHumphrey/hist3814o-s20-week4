I'll often breatheA sigh to Yarrow and to yon.When far in foreign lands I roam,And nurs’d by pallid peril’s gloom,In exile from my native home,Ha! wilt thou weep thy wanderer’s dyounOr wilt thou scorn thy early love ?Bid plighted passion cease to burn ?False to the young affections prove ?And break my heart when I return ?Ah, no ! methinks that breast of thineThe gentle thrill can ne’er repel jWhere lingers sympathy divine,Bure faithless love can never dwell.Then, when my wanderings all are o’er,A wreath to constant love I’ll twine;6The wihl sea-billows hover moreShall roll ’twixt me hnd Carolireei,. . —1 D-irfTHE .D0#?v4T?LL OF LIFE.arts v;1 rod Jbns v o3 inlA,IN' the down-hiil-'of fife, when I find I’fn dtedinmg,May my fate no less fortunate be,Than a snuj clBovv chair can afford for reclining.And a cot that o’eHooks the wide se‘a:With an ambling pad pofiey to pace o’erthe lawii,While £ carol awdy ddle "sorrow, d ■And blythe as the laricifhat-each day hails the dawn.Look forward with*hope for to morrow.SiytOid IWith a porch at my door both for shelter and-shade.,too,' « .

How blest ye flowers that round her blaw,Ye catch the glaijc^e o’ her ee,I How blest ye birds that round her sing,And welcome in the blooming year.8But crcu'biy welcome be the spring.The season to my Jeanie dea..The sun blinks blythe on yon town,Amang the broomy braes sae green ;But my delight’s in yon town,And dearest pleasure is my Jean.Without my fair, not a’ the charmsO’ Paradise could yield me joy;But gie me Jeanie in my arms.And welcome Lapland’s dreary sky;My cave wad be a lover’s bower,Tho’ raging winter rents the air.And she a lovely little flower,That I wad tent and shelter there.O Sweet is she in yon town,The sinking sun’s gaun down upon;The dearest maid’s in yon town,His setting beam e’er shone upon.If angry fate is sworn my foe,And suffering l am doom’d to bear,I’d careless quit aught else below,But spare, oh! spare my Jeanie dear.For while life’s dearest blood runs warm,My thoughts frae her shall ne’er departFor as most lovely is her form,She has the truest, kindest heart.FINIS.

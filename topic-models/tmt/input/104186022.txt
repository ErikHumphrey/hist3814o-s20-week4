His Prophecies havebeen more credited that any that were ever recordedin the Scots Chronicle, as they have been well at¬tested, what of them is past, and what they alludeto, in this present century and period, and of hisdark sayings yet to come.He told many mystical prophecies anent all theKings of Europe, and what fell out according tohis prediction, in this ancient kingdom of Scotland ;what is past, present, and to come.This brief account is taken from the Record ofCryle, near which place he was born and broughtup.His father was said to be Laird of Balcomie, andthe records of that family are extant in the Rolls,for assisting at several councils for the honour of4Scotland. And Sir Thomas the Rhymer’s pro¬phecies and sayings are still held in estimation.He lived in the reign of Alexander III. Kingof Scotland, in the year one thousand two hundredand forty-eight, much regarded, and knighted bythat king that same year.The first of his prophecies ever taken to he faith¬fully observed, was, that there should be a storm ona certain day, that would surprise all Scotland.Now, some gentlemen being with him that day,they began to joke him, and said, “ Sir Thomas, youare now mistaken, and we shall stay and see yourmistake, as we have heard so much of your prophe¬cies.” He told them to stay an hour longer, andthey would see and belie ve. And in less time thanan hour, an express arrived to Sir Thomas fromEdinburgh, of the death of Margaret, Queen ofAlexander III., who died that day. Upon receiv¬ing the news, Sir Thomas told them that this wasthe storm, and it would give rise to greater com¬motions in Scotland.After the death of Queen Margaret, the Kingmarried Isabel, daughter to the Earl of Driux;and Sir Thomas told within a few months of anearthquake at Kinghorn, that would make Scotlandtremble. * An express accordingly came to Chyleto Sir Thomas, that the King had fallen from hishorse at Kinghorn, and broke his neck. After thedeath of Alexander, he left no heirs except a grand¬child, Margaret, daughter of the King of Norway,who also soon died; but a short time before her| death she was betrothed to Edward, King of Eng¬land. After this there were great commotionsanent the succession to the crown of Scotland,which occasioned great blood-shed, particularly be¬twixt Bruce and Baliol, which you have recordedin the Scottish Histories.The pride of Spain, and the deceitful conduct ofthe French, as also concerning the Dutch, is allforetold.—Likewise the Scots battles at Torwood,Bothwellbridge, Malpaickie, Killycrankie, Sheriff-muir, Proud-Preston, near Gladsmuir, Falkirk,Culloden, the Camps in Moray-shire, on the Wind¬mill brae at Aberdeen, by General Coup, and atDunbar.In forty-five eighty-two and three,Sir Thomas’ Works doth certify.PROPHECIESOFTHOMAS THE RHYMER.As to his prophetical sayings, they are hard to beunderstood, because they are pointed out by theCoats of Arms which appertain to so many differentkingdoms and persons. Yet we may observe howhe has pointed out plainly, many things which havecome to pass in our days; such as the extirpation ofthe noble race of the Stewarts, the Revolution of *Sheriffmuir, where, he says,That three Ships and a Shield,That day shall keep the field ;And be the Antelop’s build.These three ships and a shield, are in the Dukeof Argyle’s arms. _ _ iAnd even every particular of the rebellion in1745 and 174G, when pointing at it he says,A Chieftain unchosen,Shall choose forth himself,And the realm as his own.When speaking of King Charles, be calls him“A sly Fox-bird, who would turn to Christ withthe wyles of tods and foxes,” meaning his swearingof the covenants.When speaking of the battle of Prestonpans, inthe year 1745, He names the very two neighbour-7i ing villages to the spot of ground whereon it wasfought, viz., Coyleford-green and Seton, saying,“ Between Seton and the sea sorrow should bei wrought by the light of the moon.”—Which act,really came to pass that morning the battle of: Prestonpans was fought. But how the Lion wasi hurt at this time, and not perceived, is yet a mys-Utery. Some are of opinion, that it was by taking'^away the power or superiority from the chiefs ofIothe Highland clans, so that they cannot raise men]in such a short time as formerly.|j These are a few observations on things alreadycome to pass ; and as to what is yet to come, thereis some remark will yet happen, when the timedraws nigh ; such as, “ When Tarbet’s craigs aretumbled into the sea. And the next season orsummer thereafter, great sorrow and bloodshedhappen to this realm, the chief thereof especially,such as harling on sleds, and chopping off heads.”This Tarbet stands near the root of the river Clyde;but whether its being tumbled into the sea shalliiappen by an earthquake, thunder, or by the handsif men, is a mystery unknown.There is also mention made of a lord with aucken, or double hand, which certainly is of royal)lood, and will breed great stir and confusion inBritain. This man is alive at this very presentige, and of the Stewarts’ race, now in Italy.There is plainly pointed out, that in his time, a;reat battle should be seen in Fife,Where saddled horses should be seen,Ty’d unto the trees green.I}Not only in Fife, but the four chief rivers of therealm, there should be a battle on each of them,that should make the rivers run with blood, vizTweed, Clyde, Forth, and Tay,8Last of all, a bloody desperate battle in Northumberland, on the river Tyne. Also great ha-vock and slaughter about the broad walls of Ber¬wick. All these things are yet to come to pass;and when the first appears, the rest will soon fol¬low after..'*;•! laiol rr. omit j7oaa a rioolIpWhen Hemp is come and also gone,Scotland and England shall be one.Henry, Edward, Mary, Philip, Elizabeth,VIII.

After¬wards, to the same purpose, these, and manyother strange things were foretold by ThomasLearmant, vulgarly called Thomas the Rhymer,I9because he spoke all his prophetical sayings inrhyme, and so darkly that they could not be under¬stood until they came to pass.But of all the prophets that ever were in Scot¬land, none of them attained to such credit, becausemany of his predictions referred to our own country,;:i and were accomplished in the last and presentcenturies.THOMAS THE RHYMEK’SPROPHECIES,•?

quo’ Thrummy, de’il speed moIf frae your house this night I jee ;Are we to starve in Christian land ?As lang’s my stick bides in my hand,An’ silver plenty in my pouch,To nane about your house I’ll crouch ;Landlord, you needna be sae rude,For faith we’ll make our quarters good.Come, John, let’s in, we’ll take a seat,Fat sorrow gars you look sae blate?Sae in he gangs and sets him down :Says he, They’re nane about your townSail put me out, till a new-day.As lang’s I’ve siller for to pay.The Landlord said, Ye’re rather rash.To turn ye out we sanna fash,Since ye’re sae positive to bide,But troth ye’s sit by the fire-side ;I tald ye else of beds I’ve naneUnoccupied, except bare ane,In it, I fear ye winna lye,For stoutest hearts have aft been shy16To venture in within the roomAfter the night begins to gloom ;For in it they can ne’er get rest,’Tis haunted by a filghtful ghaist!Ourselves are terrified a’ night;Sae ye may chance to get a sight,Like that which some of our folk saw.Far better till ye gang awa,Or else ye’ll maybe rue the day.Quid faith, says John, I’m thinking sae ;Better in the neuk to sit,Than fly’d, guid keep’s, out o’ our wit ;Preserve us ever frae all evil,I widna like to see the devil:Whisht gowk, quo’ Thrummy, baud your peace,That sanna gar me quit this place :To great nor sma’ I ne’er did ill,No ghaist, nor deil my sert shall spill.I can defy the mcikle deil,An’ a’ his works I wat fu’ weel;Fat sorry then maks you sae eery ?Fling by your fears, come then, be cheery.Landlord, gin ye’ll make up that bed,I promise I’ll be very glad,Within the same a’ night to lie,If that the room be warm and dry.The Landlord says, Ye’s get a fire.An’ candle too, gin ye desire,Wi’ beuks to read, and for your bed.I’ll orders gi’e to get it made.John says, As I’m a Christian man.Who never likes to curse nor ban,Nor steal, nor lie, nor drink, nor whore,I’ll never gang within its door,But sit by the fire-side a’ night,An’ gang awa whene’er ’tis light.Says Thrummy till him wi’ a glow’r,Ye cowardly gowk. I’ll make ye cower,17Come up the stair alaug wi’ me.An’ I shall caution for you be.Then Johnny faintly gaed consent.An’ up stairs to the room they went.Where soon they gat baith fire and light.To baud them hearty a’ the night;The Landlord likewise gae them meat.As meikle as they baith could eat;Show’d them their bed, and bade them gangTo it, whene’er they did think lang ;And wishing them a gude repose,Straight syne to his ain bed he goes.Our travellers now being left alane,’Cause that the frost was nippen keen,Cast aff their shoon, and warm’d their feetAnd syne gaed to their bed to sleep,But cowardly John wi’ fear was quaking,He cou’dna sleep, but still lay wanking,Sae troubled wi’ his panic fright—When near the twalt hour o’ the night,That Thrummy waken’d and thus spake ;Preserves! quoth he, I am like to choakWi’ thirst, and I maun ha’e a drink ;I will gang down the stair I think,And grapple for the water pail,0 for a waught o’ cawler ale!Johnny grips to him, an’ says, Na,1 winna let you gang awa ;Wow will you gang and leave me hereAlane to die wi’ perfect fear ?Rise and go wi’ me then, quoth Thrummy,Ye senseless gude-for-naething bummy,I’m only gaun to seek some water,I will be back just in a clatter.Na, na, says John, I’ll rather lye.But as I am likewise something dry.Gif ye can get a jug or cap,Fesh up to me a little drap.18Ay, ay, quoth Thrummy, that I will,Altho’ ye sudna get a gill.Sae down he gaes to fetch a drink.And then he thinks he sees a blinkO’ light, that shone upo’ the floor,Out thro’ the key hole o’ the door.So setting up the door a jee,Whatever’s there he thinks he’ll see ;So bauldly o’er the threshold ventures,And in within the door he enters ;But, reader, judge of his surprise,When there he saw with wondering eyesA spacious vault, weel stored wi’ casksO’ reaming ale, and some big flasks,And stride legs o’er a cask of ale,He saw the likeness o’ himsel,Just in the dress that he cast aff,A Thrummy cap and aiken staff,Gammashes and the jockey-coat;And in his hand the Ghaist had gotA big four-legged timber bicker.Filled to the brim wi’ nappy liquor ;Our hero at the spectre star’d,But neither daunted was, nor car’d,But to the Ghaist straight up did step.An’ says, dear brother, Thrummy Cap,The warst ye surely dinna drink ;Syne took a jug, pou’d out the pail.And filled it up in the same ale,Frae under where the spectre sat,And up the stair wi’ it he gat ;Took a gude drink, gaed John anither.But never tauld him o’ his britherThat he into the cellar saw,Mair than he’d naething seen ava ;Right brown and nappy was the beer ;Whar did you get it ? John did speer.Says Thrummy, Sure you needna care.I'll gae and try and get some mair.Sae down the stair again he goes,To get o’ drink, anither dose,Being positive to hae some mair;But still he fand the ghaist was there.Now on a butt behind the door :Says he, Ye didna ill before,Dear brother Thrummy, sae I’ll tryYou once again, because I’m dry,lie fills his jug straight out below,An’ up the stair again does go.John marvell’d sair but didna speerAgain, where did he get the beer,For it was stronger than the first,Sae they baith drank till like to burst;Syne did compose themselves to rest.To sleep a while they thought it best.An hour in bed they hadna been,And scarcely weel had closed their een,When just into the neighb’ring cham’erThey heard a dreadful din and clamour,Beneath the bed-claes John did cower.But Thrummy jumped upon the floor,Hum by the sark-tail John did baud.Lie still, quoth he, fat, are you mad ?Thrummy then gaed a hasty jump.And took John in the ribs a thump.Till on the bed he tumbled down,In little better than a swoon,While Thrummy, fast as he could rin.Set aff to see what made the din.The chamber seemed to him as lightAs gif the sun was shining bright;The ghaist was stallin’ at the door,In the same dress he had afore ;And o’er anent it at the wa’.Were ither apparitions twa.Thrummy beheld them for a wee.20But de’il a word as yet spoke he ;The spirits seemed to kick a ba\The Ghaist against the ither twa:While close they drave baith back and foreAtween the chimla and the door.He stops a while and sees the play,Syne rinning up he thus did say :Ane for ano may well compare,But twa for ane is rather sair :The play’s nae equal, sae I vow,Dear brother Thrummy, I’ll help you,Then wi’ his feet he kicked the ba’,Gard it play stot against the wa’:Quick then as lightning frae the skyThe Spectres, with a horrid cry,A’ vanished in a clap of thun’er.While Thrummy at the same did won’erThe room was quiet now and dark,And Thrummy stripping in his sark :Glauming the gate back to his bed.Aye thinks he hears a person tread.An’ ere he gat without the door.The Ghaist again stood him before,And in his face did staring stand,Wi’ a big candle in his hand.Quoth Thrummy, Friend, I want to knowWhat brings you from the shades below ?I, in my maker’s name, commandYou tell your story just aff hand ?Fat wad you hae?—I’ll do my bestFor you, to let you be at rest,Then says the Ghaist, Tis thirty yearsSince I’ve been doom’d to wander here ;In all that time there has been noneBehav’d so bold as you have done ;Sae, if you’ll do a job for me,Disturbance mair I’ll never gie ;Say on your tale, quoth Thrummy, I,21To do you justice, sure will try.Then mark me weel, the Ghaist replied.And you shall soon he satisfied ;Frae this aback near forty years,I of this place was overseer,When this Laird’s father had the landA’ thing was then at my command,Wi’ power to do as I thought fit,In ilka cause I chief did sit;The Laird paid great respect to me,But I an ill return did gie :The Title deeds of his estate,Out of the same 1 did him cheat,And staw them frae where they did lye ;Some days before the Laird did die.His son, at that time, was in France,And sae I thought I’d hae a chance,Gif he should never come again,That the estate would be my ain.But scarcely three bare weeks were past,When death did come and grip me fast,Sae sudden that I hadna powerThe charter back for to restore.Soon after that hame came the heir,And syne got up the reefu’ rair,What sorrow was come o’ the Rights ?They sought them several days and nightsBut never yet hae they been seen,As I aneath a meikle stane.Did hide them, i’ this chamber wa\We’ll shewed up in a leather ba’,But I was ne’er allowed to rest,Until that I the same confest;But this to do I hadna power,Frae yon time to this verra hour.That I’ve reveal’d it a’ to you:And now I’ll tell you what to do.Till nae langsyne nae rrtOny kent,22That this same Laird the Rights did want,But now they hae him at the law,An’ the neist owk the Laird maun shaw.Afore the Court, the Rights o’s laud,This puts him at an unco stand ;For if he disna shaw them there,O’ a’ his lands he’ll be strip’d bare:Nae hopes has he to save’s estate.This makes him sour and unco blate ;He canna think whar’s Rights may be.And ne’er expects them mair to see,But now my friend, mark what X tell,And ye’ll get something to yoursel’;Tak out the stane there in the wa’,And there ye’ll get the leather ba’,’Tis just the same that you did see,Whan that you said you wad help me ;The Rights are skew’d up in its heart;But see you dinna wi’ them part,Until the Laird shall pay you downJust fifty guineas and a crown,Whilk at my death was due to me.This for thy trouble, I’ll give thee :And I’ll disturb this house nae mair,’Cause I’ll be free from all my care,This Thrummy promised to do,And syne the Ghaist bade him adieu,And vanished with a pleasant sound,Down thro’ the laft and thro’ the ground.Thrummy gade back syne till his bed.And cowardly John was verra glad,That he his neighbour saw once mair.For of his life lie did despair.Wow man, quo’ John, whar hae ye been.Come tell me a’ fat ye hae seen ?Na, bide, says Thrummy, till day light,And syne I’ll tell you hale and right.Sae baith lay still and took a nap,Until the ninth hour it did chap ;Thrummy syne raise, put on his claes,And to the cham’er quick he gaes,Taks out the stane into the wa’.And soon he found the leather ha’;Took out the Rights, replaced the stane.Ere John did ken whar he had been :Then baith came stappin’ down the stair.The morning now was calm and fair.Weel, says the laird, my trusty frien’,Hae ye ought in your cham’er seen ?Quoth Thrummy, Sir, I naething sawThat did me ony ill ava.Weel, quoth the Laird, ye now may gang.Ye ken the day’s nae verra lang:In the meantime it’s calm and clear.Ye lose your time in biding here.Quoth Thrummy, Sir, mind what I tell,I’ve mair right here than you yoursel’:Sae till I like I here shall bide.The Laird at this began to chide.Says he, My friend, you’re turning rude;For here 1, just before you a’,The Rights o’ this estate can shaw,And this is mair than you can do.What! quo’ the Laird, can that be true!’Tis true, quoth Thrummy, look and see,D’ye think that I would tell a lie.The parchment from his pouch then drewAnd down upon the table threw,The Laird at this up to him ran.And cryed where did ye get them, man ?Syne Thrummy tauld him all the tale,As I’ve tauld you, baith clear and hale.The Laird at this was fidging fain.That he had got his Rights again ;And fifty guineas down did tell.Besides a present frae himsel’.24Thrummy him thanked, and syne his goudIntil a muckle purse he stowed,An’ cramed it in his oxter pouch,And syne sought out his aiken crutch :Said, Fare-ye-weel, I maun awa,An’ see gin I get through the snaw.Weel, fare-ye-weel, replied the Laird:How comes it that ye ha’na shared.Or gi’en your nei’bour o’ the money?Na, by my saul, I sir, quo’ Thrummy,When I the siller, sir, did win,To had done this wad been a sin,For he cower’d, trembling in the bed,While I it was the Gliaist had laid.And sae my tale I hefe do end,I hope no one it will offend ;My muse will no’ assist me langer.The dorty jade sometimes does lang’or.I thought her ance a gay smart lass.But now she’s come to sic a pass,That a’ my cudgelling and weeping,Will hardly wake her out o’ sleeping:To plague her mair I winna try,But dight my pen and lay it bye.fnxAou'TrfFINIS.

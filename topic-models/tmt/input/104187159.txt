how lang will mortalsDare great Nature’s laws transgress ?Rushing headlong through the portalsThat lead to such wretchedness.But yestreen I left my dwellingWi’ a mind serenely gay ;—Now my vera een are tellingWhat a man for drink must pay.Temperance ! thy couch of rosesWisdom ever loves to share;While Intemperance reposesOn the thorny breast o’ Care.Shun, then shun the road to ruim,—Through the tavern’s gate it lies ;And believe me, while so doing,On the wings of Joy ye’ll rise.ORATION ON TEETOTALIZATION.fc friends of moderation, who think a reformation,)f moral renovation, would benefit our nation;Vho deem intoxication, with all its dissipation,n every rank and station, the cause of degradation ;)f which your observation gives daily demonstration:Who see the ruination, distress, and desolation,?he open violation of moral obligation,.''he wretched habitation, without accommodation,f)r any regulation for common sustenation ;scene of deprivation, unequall’d in creation :|?he frequent desecration of Sabbath ordination,he crime and depredation, defying legislation ;Che awful profanation of common conversation ;he mental aberration, and dire infatuation,ith every sad gradation to maniac desperation :Ye who, with consternation, behold this devastation,nd utter condemnation on all inebriation ;—hy sanction its duration—or shew disapprobation,f any combination for its extermination ?We deem a declaration that offers no temptation,'lly any palliation of this abomination,i’he only sure foundation for total extirpation,nd under this persuasion, hold no communicationith noxious emanation of brewer’s fermentation,r poisonous preparation of spirit distillation,or any vain libation producing stimulation.To this determination we call consideration,nd without hesitation, invite co-operation ;ot doubting imitation will raise your estimation,nd by continuation, afford you consolation,ir in participation with this association,ou may by meditation, ensure the preservationf future generation from all contamination.And may each indication of such regeneration,the theme of exultation till its final consummation.8PARODY ON THE LAST ROSE of SUMMER’Tis the last silver shilling,Left shining alone;All its lovely companionsAre melted and gone ;No coin of its kindred,No credit is nigh,To brighten our wishes,And drown the sad sigh!iI’ll not leave thee, thou lone oneTo pine on the board ;Since the landlord desires thee,Go, swell thou his hoard.Thus foolish I scatterWhat should purchase bread.To pamper an idler,And gain a sore head.And soon I must follow—Finances decay ;For now from before meThe stoup’s snatch’d away.When half-crowns are melted.And cruckies are flown,Ah! who would inhabitA tavern alone!

JOHNSTON.THEJovial Songster.What a beauty I did grow.When I was a little boy,Some fifteen years ago,I was the pride of my mammy,—Lord she made me quite a show.Such a beauty I did grow.I‘d red straight hair and goggle eyes,And such a roguish leer,—A large flat nose, and mouth,That reach'd from ear to ear.Such a beauty, &c.My mammy doted on me,And when my mouth she’d fill,For fear she'd spoil it with a spoon,She fed me with a quill.Such a beauty, &c.And when that I could run alone,Stock still I never stood,The ducks were my companions,As I weddled thro‘ the mud.Such a beauty, Ac.Then I learned to be musical,And got off songs so pat,I could grunt bass like any pig,Mew treble like a cat.Such a beauty, Ac.Then I went to a dsncing-school,For to be finish'd there,And they said I danc'd a minuetAs graceful as a bear.Such a beauty, Ac.With a mountebank a candidate,I beat them all quite hollow,Aud I won this pretty gold-laced hat,By grinning thro' a collar.Such a beauty, &c.My name is Tommy Hening,As every body knows,They stick me in the barley-fieldsTo frighten off the crows.Such a beauty, &c.Curtis was old Hodge's WijeCurtis was old Hodge's wifejFor virtue none was ever such,She led so pure, so chaste a life,5Hodge said ’twas vartue over mueh :For says sly old Hodge, says he.Great talkers do the least, d’ye see.Curtis said, if men were rude,She‘d scratch their eyes out, tear theii hair;Cried Hodge, “ I believe thou'rt wondrous good,However, let us nothing swear.”For says, &c.©ne night she dream't a drunken foolBe rude with her in spite would fain ;She makes no more, but with join-stool,Falls on her husband might and main.Still says, &c.By that time she had broke his nose,Hodge made shift to wrake his wife:“ Dear Hodge,” said she, “ judge by these blows,I prize my vartue as my life.”Still says, &c.I dreamt a rude man on me fell;However I his project marr'd—“ Dear wife,1’ cried I “’tis mighty well.But next time don't hit quite so hard.”For says, &c.At break of day Hodge cross'd a stile,Near to a field of new-mown hay,And saw and cuis'd his stars the while,Curtis and Numps in am'rous play." Was'nt I right?" says Hodge says he;" Great talkers do the least, d'ye see."6Paddy's Burying.■ • Am.—The Irish Wedding.An Irish ladIs always mad,Roaring, singing, swearing, O,And Paddy ClemWas just the sameFrom birth unto his burying, O,Twas at the sign of the Artichoke,The whisky did overtake him, OHe fell asleep and never woke, .So Fat's friends met to wake him, O.With fillillillo !

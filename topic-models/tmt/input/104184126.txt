Tlie plague went on! •Amazement spread! Conjecture, thin as air.With many a ghostly shadow in her train,1‘ose up to solve the problem why they died;”’ IVas in the atmosphere—'Twas in the clothes—Jhe food—the blood—the lungs—the mind—’twas fear5’T«as constitulional—contagious—mild—Severe incurable—a simple tliinj;—A mighty tnysterv nevr to be disclos’d.Such were the vulgar theories pursu’d.All empty as the breath that gave them birth.And spite of all, the pestilence jogg’d on\t ith silent step, and sudden death, and woe.And bitterness to manv ; and to allDismay and terror. Men’s hearts fail’d for fear.Suspended seem'd all labour and affairs,All human life stood still as petrified.And hung the head, and sigh'd a hopeless sigh,As though creation’s final doom had come.1 riends met upon the street and halted mute.Or, if they spake, ’twas with a shaking head,1 lutf muttering “ 'Tis an awful time indeedThey parted with a nod, and met no more:Vor ere the next day’s Sun had gone his roundThe lone note of the village-bell proclaim’dThat one or both, should, in a little hourlie laid, to mingle with the dust of death.The tender wife behind the curtains, clasp’dIn love's embrace her lively spouse at cv’u.And with the rising ray of light, beheldThe ghastly features of her lifeless lord.l l»e husband saw the wife, whose healthy handHad dress’d the meal of which he last pat took,Tie struggling in the ravages of death.A few short hours were all that interven'dBetween the strong, robust, athletic swain.6And cold lump of dull uncon.^ious clay.l^ii* pUguH went on—and oh! what dire distress.And w/ie,and lamentation, and despair.And clouded brows, and melancholy dark.O'er all the village spread! and still anonDeep wailings for the dead, and mingled groansOf agonised life expiring fastI rom many a dwelling came. Small sable groupsRound many a door in sullen silence stood,V> ith hand on mouth to ward contagion’s breath.All mournful, waiting to convey the corpseTo the lone mansions of the peaceful dead ;Yet none approach'd the bier, save those few friendsV*. hose sympathy was strong ns love of life.All distant stood—yea, rv’n the Man of God,He, who alone knew why the people died,And solv'd the problem with “ 'Tis heaven’s decree!”His daily theme of happiness in heaven,Aud angel's harp, and glory's diadem.And righteous hope, that would Is* realisedWith strange unutterable things reserv’dTor all who did believe, had made him deemHonours and riches, yea, and life itselfMere secondary things, vain triUes, trash,\ ague bubbles, quite unworthy the regardOf dignified immortal things like man ;Yet even he felt smitten with the dread—Forgot his calling and his trust in God—Refus'd to minister the gospel's balmTo dying husband, or to widow'd wife.771 ie plague wen! on—and awful numbers diedOf every age. and sex, and rank, and kind.Tile matron of threescore—the blooming maid—Tlie sucking child—the babe within the wombDied while unborn—the foolish and the wise,Tile weak, the strong, the wicked and the good,Tile lusty tradesman and the sickly fop.Tile child of mis’ry and the man of wealth,Tile florid drunkard, and the sage who spurn’dThe darrling cup that held the poison'd draught;All fell alike before the dreadful scourge.Died then the virtuous? yea, I knew him well,A imin of stern unbending principle,With soul untutor’d to the yoke of pow’r,t’naw’d by wealth or popular renown;He pray’d and labour’d for the rights of all,Till t veu int’rest that supinely lullsThe conscience of the high priest and the kingShrunk from his being, as asham’d to meetInflexible alliance to the truth.And he is gone! the voice ofheav’n—that breathesUpon the midnight wind—that sweeps his graveWhile I repeat this short expressive dirge“ Peace to his ashes"—seems to say “ Amen."Unhappy village! what art thou become?Sad emblem of the fleeting things of life!What bosom bleeds not for thy cureless woes ?Deserted homes, and orphans’ plaintive cries.And widow’s tears, and deep parental throes.And so’itary husband's «ttfl’d groan,8Lead back the mind through time’s encumber'd mazeTo Egypt’s mourning for her fond hrst-born,Or Kama’s wailing for her children slain.The plague went on—Conjecture ceas’d, for nowAll theories seem’d vain—men only fear'd,Nor knew what 'twas ttiey dreaded! 'Twas fear of fear.The grave physician, whose best feelings fellA sacrifice h ng since, before the shrineOf motley ills, who fatten’d on disease.And mark’d with apathetic unconcernThe thousand thousand various forms of pain.That rack'd the carcase of humanity.Stood here without one scientific phrase,Observ'd the ravage of the strange unknown,Bluntly confess’d his ignorance and awe,And cross’d his arms, and said “’Tis death! ’tis death!!”FINIS.DAVID ARNDT, PRINTKft, BEITH.

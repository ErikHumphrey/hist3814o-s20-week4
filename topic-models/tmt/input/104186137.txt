His eldest son, Robert Bruce, succeed¬ed King of Scotland.D rnagilla of Gwlloway claimed the crown, as heir toMargaret, e'dest daughter to prince David.Robert Bruce, earl of Garrick, albeit son to Isabelthe second daughter yet, contended that in feudalsuccession, the hrst male ought to succeed before awoman standing in the some degree, as a son exclud¬ed! Ins sister from succession, altho’ she be elder:and therefore he ami Dornagilla of Galloway, stand¬ing in the same degree from prince David, he oughtto he prefered to her ; as for her son John Baliol, hecould claim no right but by her, and likewise a de¬gree further off from prince David.The right of succession being thus made doubtful,the competitors were so powerful that they drew thegreatest pait of the kingdom into two equal factions ;so that it seemed impossible to settle the controver¬sy at home, without running into a pernicious civilwar.The states of Scotland, to prevent this mischief,thought it titter to submit the arbitrament of tire plea• to Edward I sirnaraed Longshanks, king of England,Jam! that upon divers weighty reasons ; lor he and hisfaiher K. Henry III, being joined by many alliance*{ 4 )of bands and friendship tf> the two last kings of Scot¬land, had lived in great amity and concord with themreceiving & interchanging many favours and kind du¬ties.The two competitors also, Bruce and Biliol, hadas great ground in England as in Scotland, so that heand he only, was able to make them stand to rea¬son.Finally the state of Scotland not being able to de-teronne the plea, there was no prince besides merepowerful, and in appearance, more like to composethe controversy, without great blood-shed.This motion was in secret very greedily embracedby Edward, hoping in, so troublesome a water, toSind a gainful fishing, eitheT by drawing the king¬dom of Scotland under the direct subjection, or atleast under his homage, as lord paramount and supe¬rior.And to make the controversy more fearful he stir¬red up other 8 competitors besides Bruce and Baliol,Florence earl of Holland (descended from Ada) sisterto 'William the Lyon ; Patrick Dunbar, earl ofMarch •, Sir Walter Ross ; Sir Nicholas Soules ; SirRoger Mandevilie ; Sir John Gumming of BadenochftKese five were descended of younger daughters ofAllan, Lord of Galloway) Sir William Viscie, begot¬ten upon king Alexander II.’s bastard daughter, butpretending to be legitimate : and John Hastings lord.Abergaveny, descended of Ada,youngest daughter toprince David Huntington.Edward having thus prepared matters, came to£■ '-wick and met with the men of Scotland, to whomh promised to deride the controversy tccotVirg to«qi ty ■ & rh it might c mote likely lie broughtftom Eratu.'e sv.nuiy oi the most faindus lawyers pf( 5 )dwt age ; he chose also out o f the states of Sdotlamlassembled, twelve of the wisest and most honourableto whom he joined the like number.of English, asses¬sors to him in his arbitrament.At the meeting, by the doubtful answers of law¬yers, and the number of new precedents, hemade the matter more difficult, and appointed a newconvention at Norham, on the border, in the year fol¬lowing.Difficulties thus increasing, and the earl of Hollandhaving on foot a great army, to take the crown ofScotland by force, ^which their own stories affirm, tohave landed in Scotland, and to have intercepted somestrengths) at the meeting of Norham. king Edwarddealt secretly, and by fit agents with the states of. Scotland, for shuning imminent dangers, to becomehis subjects ; he, being descended of King David'ssister, and so but two degrees farther from the crownof Scotland than Bruce or Baliol wereThis being denied by all, he betook himself to hisother design. And first dealt secretly with RobertBruce, promising to discern is his favour, if he wouldtake the crown of Scotland holden of him, and dohim homage for it. 'But he stoutly refused to subject a free nation toany over-lord ; whereupon king Edward called forJohn Baiiol, who, knowing that he was not so muchfavoured of the States of Scotland, easily condescen¬ded to king Edward’s desire, and was by him declar¬ed king of Scotland : the States, desirous of peace,conveyed him to Scoon, where he was crowned, anno1291, and all, except Bruce, swore obedience tohim.Thereafter Duncan Macduff, earl of Fife, was kill¬ed by lord Abernethy, (a man of great powrer in those?( G )times allied both with the Cummings and Baliol) theearl’s brother finding the King partial in the admini¬stration of justice sumnu ned him to appear beforethe King of England in parliament * vvhtre being pre¬sent, and sitting beside King Edward, (after he haddone him homage) when he was called upon to an¬swer at the bar. This indignity grieved him greatly,he resolved to free himself of this bondage.At the same time war breaking out between Eng¬land and France;, king Edward sent ambassadors tothe parliament of Scotland to send aid to him, as nowbeing their over lord.There came also other ambassadors from France,de siring the ancient league to be renewed.The Kins; and the Stares of Scotland renewed theleague with France, which had remained, inviolablykept, for the space of 500 years before. *. The king of England’s suit was rejected, becausethe pretended surrender and homage, was made byJohn Baliol privately, without the consent of the par¬liament.A marriage was also concluded betwixt prince Ed¬ward Balioi, and.a daughter of Charles, ear! of Va¬lois, brother to the French king Philip.Edward having foreseen all things had drawn Ro¬bert Bruce, earl of Carrick, with his friend's, (enemies« -to Balioi) and divers noblemen of Scotland, w ho heldlands of him in-England, to bring-such forces as theycould make, to assist him in the -French war: butwithal making truce with the French for some monthshe suddenly turned his forces destined againstFrance, towards vScotland.His navy .was vanquished at Berwick, and 18 ofhis ships taken.Yet his land host, by the. means of the BrucianI( 7 )faction and the Englished Scots nobleman, took thetown of Berwick with great slaughter, and shortlythereafter, Dunbar, Edinburgh and Stirling.I In, and about thes" castles he had killed and takencaptives the greatest p art of the Scots noblemen ; sothat crossing Forth, the blow being sudden, he foundno preparation for resistence, 1'alioi surrendered him¬self to King Edward at Montrose, and was sent byhim into England, where he remained captive tillsuch time as by intercession of the Pope, he was setat liberty swearing anc^giving^ hostages never to re¬turn to Scotland, King Edward came to Scoon, andtook upon him the crown of Scotland, as forfeited bpthe rebellion of his hom.tger BaiichHe sent for the nobles of Scotlapd who remained,that they wish such as were his captives might swearhomage tb him as their leige Lord and King, thosewho refused, were detained prisonersBut while men of power neglected the public*cause of the liberty,ot Scotland. William V/ailaca youth of honourable birth, being son to Malcoo,Wallace of Elder she, but of mean powers, havingfirst in private killed many Englishmen of the garri¬sons as he could overtake them, bv these explotis, be¬ing so encouraged, (being a man of ins ineible hardi¬ness, incredible strength of body, and withal verywise ami circumsnect) that he gathered his friendsand neighbours, and by jeopardies and stratagems,,divers times cut off great numbers of the enemy ; thereport thereof drew to him such as affected the liber¬ty and tire welfare of their country, and had courageto hazard themselves for vindicating thereof, withtheir friends and Servants ; who after some valiant,exploits happily atchieved, and an army of 10,COOmen led by Thomas earl of Lancaster the earl of( S )IWarren, defeated by Wallace at Bigger, (holding aaassembly at the Forest Kixk) chose Wallace to bewarden of Scotland, and viceroy in Baliol’s place ; inwhich office he so valiantly behaved himself, that in3 short space he recovered all the strength on the bor-Mer, and brought the south of Scotland to good quiet.The English fearing the loss of all, subrilly tooktor one year, beginning in Fe¬in June following, they proclaimed a justice eyreto be held at Glasgow and Air the 18th of that monththinking to entrap Wallace and all his friends and un¬der colour of law, to cut them off at the day appoint¬ed.All landed men according to the custom assemblingto this court, the English condemned them for felo¬ny, and hanged them presently ; amongst the rest,Sir Ronald Crawford, sheriff of Air, uncle to Wal¬lace, Sir Bryce Blair, Sir Neil Montgomery, and ma-sy of the barons of Kyle, .Cunningham, Carrick andClydesdale.Those who escaped advertised Wallace, whochanc-ed to come later than the rest.He assembling such of the country, as ^detestingso horrible a fact extremely hated the authors there-tsf, in the beginning of the night, secretly entered in¬to Air, set fire to the place where the Englishmen,after that fact were securely sleeping, and sufferednone to escape.The garrisons of the castle issued forth to quenchthe fire, and ambush laid for the purpose, enteredthe house and made it sure. The next moning Wal¬lace came to Glasgow, where the Lord Henry Pier-cy had retired from Air the day before : him he cx-pu'sed thence with great slaughter.The victory he so hotly pursued, that immediatelyatruce with Wallacbruary.( 9 )thereafter he took the castle of Stirling, recove»$lArgyll and Lorn, with tne town of St. Johnstoun,and country about hence he travelled thro’ Angusand Mearns taking in all the strength till he came toAberdeen, which he found forsaken by the English,who had fled by sea, with the lord Henry Beaumont,an English lord, who had married the heritrix of theearldom of Buchan, named Gumming.Thus all the north country was reduced to the o-bedience of Wallace, except the castle of Dundee ;while he lay at the siege thereof, news came of theapproach of the English army led by John earl ofWarren and Surry, and Sir Hugh Cressingham witha great number of Northumberland men, and suchof the Scots as held with’England to the number of30,000.Wallace having with him 10,000 men hardenedin arms met him beside Stirling, on the north side ofthe Forth which having no fords at that place, waspassible only by a wooden bridge. This he on pur¬pose had caused to be Weakened, so that the one halfof the host being past, led by Cressingham, the bridgebrokj with the great weight, of their baggage.Those who were come over, Wallace charged sud¬denly, before they were put in order, and cut themost part in pieces, with their leader Cressingham,the.rest seeking to escape were drowned in the wa¬ter.The earl of Warren, and these that escaped, wereassailed by earl Malcom Lennox, captain of Stirlingcastle, and being hotly pursued by Wallace, hardlyescaped, himself flying into Dunbar, a castle then be¬longing to the earl of March.In this battle fought the 13th of September, 1297,there died no Scotsmen of remark, but Andrew Mtti>l.=r(10 }ray of Bothwel.The English garrisons hearing of this discomfiturelied from all places, so th<it before rh<i last of Septem-.ber, all the straights of'Scotland, were recovered ex-cept Berwick and Roxburgh.After those victories he held a parliament at St.Johnstoun, as warden of Scotland, and settled thewhole country, caused the nobility to swear to befaithful to the state, till such times as they mightconsider*who should be king : Earl Patrick Dunbarrefusing to acknowledge the authority of such a par¬liament, was chused out of Scotland; and becausethe year by-past the ground had not been manured andgreat famine threatened the land, Wallace assembleda great host, and entered England, where he remain¬ed all the winter and the spring following, living u-pon the enemy’s provisions and enriching his soldiersby their spoil ; during which time the English durstnever encounter him in open tieid, only at the firstentry, King Edward with a great army of raw soldierscame against him in the plain of Stanmure; hut per¬ceiving the discipline & hardy resolution of Wall ice’shost, before they came nearer than half a mile drewback his army and retired : Wallace, for fear of am¬bush, kept his soldiers in order, and pursued themnot.' Scotland thus enjoying perfect liberty, Wallacebeing earnestly requested by the French king, to theend that his special captains might be kept in mili-taiy exercise during the peace, sailed over to Francewith 50 of them in his company.He was encountered on the way by Thomas of Char¬ters, wjio, with It! sail infested the seas ; but boardingWallace’s ship he was taken by him, and thereifterJpJHght most valiantly under him, and King Roberti( II )Bruce, for the liberty v>f Scotland.After Wallace landed in France he was employedin war against the English, who at that time possess¬ed the duchy of Guienne and Bordeaux*, them he.defeated in several skirmishes*But in a few days he was called home by some ofhis friends in Scotland,-forKing Edward understand¬ing his absence, and pretending he had broken thepeace in Guienne, dealt with Robert Bruce earl ofCarrick, and his friends, and with such noblemen of,•Scotland as held lands in England, or envied Wal¬lace’s glory, telling that it was a shame for them tosuffer Wallace, a mean gentleman, to rule Scotland,while any of the blood royal did remain ; so promis¬ing his assistance to Robert Bruce, he sent a greatarmy into Scotland and by the help of the Brucianfaction, and English noblemen, he easily obtained thegreatest strengths of Scotland.Wallace returned the next summer, and secretlyamassing a number of his special followers, who hadlurked till his back-coming, on a sudden surprizedSt Johnstoun by a stratagem, and pursuing his victo¬ry hotly, chased the English out of Fife.Upon the report hereof, all the rest of his follow¬ers came from their lurking holes, by whose assis¬tance he recovered divers‘Strengths.Lord Wm. Douglas took the castle of Sanquhar bya stratagem, and finding the English captains of the’neares. garrisons coming to beseige him. he sent se¬cretly to Wallace, who coming with his power, notonly raised the siege, but chased ail.'he English gar-ri.'Otis out of these quarters -, from whence he wenti to the north parts, .which he recovered with smalldifficulty, except the strong cattle of Dundee, towjiidi he laid siege.( 1-9 )IHfleKing of England grieved at the fortunate sho.•sessof Wallace, and understanding that he was high-\j envied by the earl of March, the Cummings, anddivers ancient noblemen i he stirred up Robert Bruceelder, and his faction persuading thei* that Wallacewas Bruce’s only competitor for the Crown.Having so made a strong pa^ty for himsel? in thenext spring he came with an army of 40,000 men,Scots and English, to Falkirk, six miles from Stir-Mug. The Scots army was ver* great,' feeing thirty%h ousand strong, if they had been all of one mind.John Cumming, lord of Cumbernauld, who had an•ye to the crown, had persuaded Lord John Stewart,of But , being tutor, and grandfather by the mother,to .horrl J.rm.es Stewart of Renfrew, lately deceased,to ontend with Wallace for the leading of the van¬guard, alleging that the same belonged to Lord Stew¬art’s house oy ancient privilege.W llace refuoing this, they parted one from ano¬ther in high chaff, there remaining no more with him•titan 10,000 of his old soldiers.Camming, with 10,000 of his followers, after a• wmll shew of resistance, fled treasonably, leaving thevaiiant*Stewart inclosed by two battalions of the Eng-.Ssh, by whom, after he had rought valiently for along time, he was cut off with all Ids followers.Wallace with his party defended themselves va¬liently, until they were safely retired beyond theriver Carron, losing (besides some others) the nobleSir John Graham, the most valiant worthy of Scot-t^nd, next unto Wallace.Bruce, whom the King of England had broughtwi h all his friends into the field, pretending to assisthim for the recovery of his right from the usurper,Bruce perceiving Wallace on the other side the Carron.desired to speak with him, and upbraiding him witlisuch a foolish usurpation of the kingdom oi Scotlmd,against so powerful a faction at home, assisted by somighty a King abroad — I, answered Wallace, intendnever to reign in Scotknd, but finding my nativecount!y abandoned by veu and Buliol, who have thelight to the crown, have set myself to defend myfriends ann neignbovirs from the unjust tyranny andusurpation of tne King of England, who setteth youforth most unnaturally to tear the bowels of yourmother with your own handsAfter divers speeches to this purpose,. Bruce, per¬ceiving the fraudful ami ryiamtus dealing cl KingIdwmrd, returned to the host.The next morning Wallace understanding that theInglish army w as weakly tnt enched and in greatsecurity, amassing with his own army such as hadescaped, set upon them in the dawning before theycould %e arrayed, and killed many : so that the Eng-. Jish King returned at that time without any furtheri exploit.Bruce, remembering what he heard from Wal¬lace, desired King Edward, according to his former| promises, to put him in possession of so mucli ot thej kingdom of Scotland as then was under his powet ;i to whom he answered in the French tongue, “ havei ve no more to do but conquer kingdoms for you.”i By thi s speech the ’..ord Bruce conceived so great grief; and anger, that within few days he departed this lifei without seeing his eldest son Robert Bruce, after-' wards King, he being kept, for assurance of his fa-! ther’s obedience, in Cal .is Castle in Fr nee.After this unhappy battle, Wallace, striving tfl re¬cover such castles and strengths as King Edward hadintercepted, found such opposition and backward-( 14 }ness, by envious emulators, that he returned-to St.Johnstoun, and in the assembly of the States, resign¬ed his charge of Warden, and with 13 men passedag^.in into France, according to a promise at his re¬turn therefrom.This fell out at the end of the year 1300—The opposite faction having gained their desire,chose John Gumming as Governor : the rather be.cause King Edward had promised to assist him to theCrown of Scotland : but he found him as great anenemy as he had been to Wallace.For after seven months truce, obtained by means •of the French King, Ec.ward sent Sir Ralph. Godfreywith a great army to subdue the Scots, and to putan end to the^var, which they expected wt^u-ld beeasy, Wallace being now out of the way.John Cumming, joining \v^':h Lord Simon Frazer,,making 8 or 9,000 men, came to resist the English;who hivi'ig wasted the country as far as Roslyn, a*bout five miles from Edinburgh, expecting no resist¬ance, divided themselves into three parties, that theymight spoil farther into the country.The Scots embracing the Occasion, set upon the .first division, and easily discomfitted them ; the se¬cond, being stronger by the joining of tho-.e who fled,was after a long conflict put to the rbut: by this thethird division, coming to the revenge, put the Scotsto a great strait, as being sorely u 'anded, wearied,and weakened in the two former battles, and havingwithstand a fresh enemy, of far greater number :.hereupon they were forced to h 11 the captives, lestthey should assist the enemy, and with their weaponsto arm the b igg-age Vnen ; and setting forward bothwith courage and necessity, seeing no escape, after aking and hard fight, they put the enemy to flight.-—( 15 )jThia was March 24th, 1302.King Edward, >ore incensed by this evil success,sent i'or Robert Bruce, younger, out of Calais, whomihe persuaded, that he had fora longtime, againsti Wallace, defended his father’s right to the Crown )f: Scotland; that having put Wallace out of the way,ihe found the Cummings as great enemies: not with-; standing, he intended yet once more to put that ene-f my out of the way, and to settle him in the kingdom.1 The young prince believing him caused all his friendsand favourers in Scotland, to join with him, and en¬tering the border, spoiled the country and took diverscastles as f;r as Douglas. Some report that thelady Douglas named Fcrras, an English woman, be¬trayed that castle to the Bruce, who took Lord Wm.Douglas captive, with all his children and goods.—1 The Lord himself was kept prisdner in- Berwick, ^nd: thereafter in York, where he died. Meantime, KingI Edward had prepared a mighty army by land and sea,i with which he entered Scotland, and subdued all be-I fore him while he came to Stirling, .kept then by 8irj Wm. Oliphant, who, after a long siege, knowing of! no relief, yielded the castle upon condition, that,; himself and all that wore with him, should pass, M’ith their lives safe : notwithstanding King EdwardI kepr still all the noblemen, together with the cap amj Sir William Otiph tm, and such as would not swear| homage to him, (pretending to he the protector of! Robert Bruce’s right) he sent prisoners to Lonc‘On.Having in this castle intercepted divers of John, Cumming's friends, he procured them to draw him toI a parley with him ; in which he so blinded him withthe hopes of the kingdom, and with fear of utter un-■ doing, that he joined himself and his friends to thei English; who, by this accession, easily passed lor-( IS )ward with the course of victory, as far as the utmostbounds of Ross; and in his back coming,^carried awaywith him into England all books, registers, histories,laws and monumentfof the kingdom : and amongothers, the fatal marble chair, whereupon the formerScots Kings used to be crowned at Scoon, on whichw *s engraved a prophecy ‘ That wherever this chairshould be transported, the Scots should commandthere ?' He carried also with him all the learned men andprofessors of Scotland, among others the famous Dr.John Duns, surnamed Scotus, thinking thereby to dis¬courage and effeminate the minds of the Scots, thatthey should cast off all care of recovering their liberty,the memory thereof being drowned in oblivion.At his return into England, he left his cousin, SirAymer Valance, Earl of Pembroke, viceroy, havingfortified all the castles with strong garrisons.The Scots who stood for the liberty of their coun¬try being forsaken by John Gumming, sent earnestletters to France,.to move Wallace to return—he wasthen making war upon the English in Guienne; buthearing the mischiefs of his country, he obtained leaveof the French King to return ; and secretly gatheringsome of hTs friends, recovering divers castles andtowns in the north, and having greatly increased hisarmy, besieged St. Johnstoun, till it surrendered.But as he proceeded in the course of his victorieshe was betrayed by his familiar friend, Sir JohnMonteith to Aymer de Vallance, who sent him toEngland, where by King Edward’s command, he wwspur to'death, and his body quartered, and sent intothe principal cities of Scotland, to be set up f»r aterror to others.Notwithstanding, this cruelty prevailed little for:( 17 |the assuring of King Edward’s co|$uest; new ene-'mies arising whence he least expected; for 3s he re¬turned from his last journey irto Scotland John Gum¬ming and Robert Bruce meeting together after a longconference on the state of their country, perceived,that notwithstanding he had promised each of themapart his help to obtain the crown of Scotland, yethis intention was only to use their assistance to con-> quer and secure it to himself, as he well declared byspoiling the country of- all monuments, public andprivate.—Hereupon they agreed that Cuming shouldquit all his rights to the crown in favour of Bruce,ard that Bruce should give him all his lands for hisassistance, and this contract was written and sealedby both parties.Upon this Bruce, watching an opportunity to risein arms, left his wife and children in Scotland, andwent to the court of England.After his departure, Gumming, (as it is reported)either repenting himself of this agreement, or elseendeavouring fradulently to oppose his co-rival, andso obtain an easier way to the kingdom, revealed theirsecret combination to Edward ; and in evidence of it,he sent him the covenant signed bv.them bo'h—Uponthat, Bruce was impeached as guilty of high treason ;he was forbidden to depart the Court, and a privateguard set over him, to inspect his wordsund actions.The King’s delay to punish him for a crime so mani-"fest, proceeded from a desire he had to take his breth¬ren too, before they had heard any noise of his exe¬cution.Bruce advertised of his danger by the Earl of Glo-cester (some call him the Earl of Montgomery) hisold friend v.ho had sent him a pair of sharp spurs,and some crowns of gold, as if he had borrowed theby nig u, shoes three horses backward, and posted a-way frpm court with two in his company, and on tbefifth : y (the way being deep in winter,) arrived at.his own castle of Lochmaben. where he found hisbrother Edward, with Robert Fleeming, James Lind¬say, Robert Kilpatrick, and Thomas, Charters, whotold him how Wallace was betrayed by Sir JohnMonteith, and the Gumming faction a few - days be¬fore.Immediately thereafter they intercepted a mes¬senger with letters from Gumming to King Edward,desiring that Br'uce should be dispatched m haste',lest being a nobleman much favoureu by the com¬mons he should raise greater stirs.The treachery of John Gumming, before only sus¬pected, was hereby made m anifest, which so incen¬sed the Lord Bruce, tha!/ riding to Dumfries, andfinding Cum.ming at the mass of the Grey Friars,after he had shewn him his letters, in impatience, hestabbed him with his dagger ; and others who wereabout him doing the like, not only dispatched him,but also his cousin Sir Edward Gumming, and ocheraiwho assistedThis slaughter'fell out on the 9th of February, inthe year 13Ob, as we now account.The Bruce thus rid of the enemy, found a greatnumber as it were rising out of his ashes, even thewhole puis mt name of C-vnming, with their aides!the earl of March, the Lord of Lorn, the lord oiAbernethev, the lord of Brechin, the lord Soules, themost part of the noth, and all Galloway followed theCummings : the earl of March, tde Lard Will,.nrSoules commanded the Merse. with Berwick uierite Border; all which they yielded to King Edward(V19 )ami maintained against Robert Bruce.At the same time, his two brothers, Thomas andAlexander Brute, with Ronald Crawford younger,I secretly landing in Galloway, were taken by Duncan1 Macdougal a great man in Galloway, and sent toKirig Edward, who caused tin m all three to be hang¬ed.On the other side assembled to him, beside theseabove named, the young lord James Douglas, (whoj hearing of his Father’s death, had returned fromI France, where he was at school, and staid a timawith his kinsman, Willi im Lai^erton, bishop of St.Andrews,) earl Malcom Lennox, earl John ofAthole, ( although of the Gumming blood, yet beingfather-in-law to Edward Bruce,) Sir Ntil Campbell,Sir Gilbert Hay, Sir Christopher Seaten, Sir Tho¬mas Ronald.

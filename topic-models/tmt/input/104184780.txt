Ifinstanceswenecessary to provetheassertion, I could piduce hundred within my own knowleddmany not above a twelvemonth ago, tbjhave been ruined by the pernicious itch fgaming. Young noblemen and gentlemjust come to clear estates and affluent f«ltunes, have, in the hour of dissipation beway laid to gamblers, and through thiarts, frauds, and deceptions, have been striped of the last shilling.—Tradesmen »iV.5others, though not exactly in the same'way,yet in ways similar tothe before mentioned,have been tricked all by the gamblers' ;itheconsequences wHeteof have beenemigra-Ition, bankruptcy,' dr imprisonment. Thelower dass of mankind having had theirshare of the supposed run of ill luck, orfrowns of fortune, as they call it, and notknowing when they are imposed on, havebecome sufferers in the last degree ; manyof whom, in order to retrieve their losses,have had recourse to picking of pockets,1 shop-lifting, and such like offences, till em-- boldened by success, and for some length oftime escaping detection, they have set outon greater exploits, such as breaking intohouses by|night, robbingonthehighway, &c.fltill at length they finish their careeratNew¬gate, where they have declared, that lovebf gambling was the first step that led themiron to the commission of great crimes.I shall now give you an account of the(games at which the Gambler is most dex¬trous, and the means by which h’e imposeston and defrauds others, thebettertoputyoufbn your guard against his villainy.—I shall: mentionseveral of the most fashionable andilluring pleasures at which theirvariousme*..( 6 )i^hodsof deludingandcheatingarcpr^ctiseid |lwith si^ces^, viz. ^jarti^g houses, Horscv ttraces, • ,.Cockfightiug, ^ ^illi^rds, 11'ennis, Pliarch^Cqiigp^t-cair, Hazard, %c. |together ,with llouts,:Assemblies, Masque-rades, a«d Concerts of a particular or pri-vate nature ; in the lattef.ofthese you will Ifind notorious gamhlers of the female sex*who deal in art and deception, as well assome more notorious male cheats, who fre¬quently barter one commodity for another,provided discount is allowed.In this great city are several houses notonly converted, but others built, for the as¬sembly of gamblers, into which, however,none under a certain degree are admitted,unless a friend of asubscriberisintroducedas a novice in the art, in order tobeinitiatedinto those rules of fraud and cunning theysquare his actions by : his admittance maybe effected at theexpenceoffiveortenthou-sand pounds, and a qualification isgivenofhis adoptness in the science, which will e-nable him to exhibit with eclat at Newmar¬ket, or York races. These pretenders to hon¬or and honesty, have been detected manytimes in practising the vilest frauds at playparticularly at the game of hazard, which isuuch in vogte among the 'gamblers wanjarry false dice which they substitute inme room of fair ones, with so much dexter-y and slight, that the cheat is not thoughtf,northedicesuspected;torshouldyoUexa-line them, it wouldbealmostimpossibletomd out the deception unless you were versedi their arts and tricks—Thus set up witkilse dice, false cards, and a Wicked design-ig heart, they prey upon the ignorant andnthinking: And as they head together onII occasions, so they give each other assist-ace ; whilst one gamester is cheating thenan of fortune within doors,othersarelay-iig traps for them without,by procuring in->rmation of his estate or fortune from his^rvantsor acquaintances, procuring stamps;i) assign over his estate, inreadiness,tellingle old usurer that money is wanted at B-s,nd if lie does not be quick with it, hisbro-aer Jew in iniquity, shall be before handijith him.—The sum must be a round one,>r the prodigal has many thousand acrestole'disposed of, and thatimmediately—Awaylobbies the old gentleman, who generally>?ceives so much per cent, tor the money1 e lends, till between them all, the gentle¬man isfleeced of part, if not his whole estateThe shame oi being thought bubble, anaexposed to the town, frequently prevents;jgentlemen from making use of the statuteprovided in such cases, rather than theirxeputationshouldsuffer, the)’ tamely submitto be plundered as aforesaid.At Horse faces the countrymen maybe assured of meeting with gamblers, whomake a practise of going from one race tanother ail over the kingdom; and, not withstanding the country farmer, and breederofhorses, may, in reality, be a better judge ofjthese cattle than the gamester, yet I vvouircaution him against wagering with thesegentry, as they, becoming parties in manymatches, get information from differenbands which horse is, and which is not telwin, and by that means generally take you!in, as they call it, and laugh at your folly—Then often make bets amongthemselves;merely to deceive you, and give a preference to the horse they know must lose, iriorder to draw you in to lay money upon itIf it happens (which is seldom the casethat an honest match is to be.run, of wbicBthey are unacquainted, then they make us*of the following or like stratagem, to mlsure their pockets ; Hot is thev lav you iflet, anc! put the money into the next ^en-nan’s hands to hold, whom they pretendhey do not know (though he is at the sameime their intimate colleague) ;■ if you winhe gentleman is not to be found ; if youoss, then one of the in meets, you, withauch concern in his countenance, and saysle, by following your example, ami layingm the wrong horse, has lost twice yourum; then squeeze you by the hand, andrishes you better luck another time, ando bids you farewell for the present.I Cock-fighting, of all games, is surelyme of the most barbarous, and a scandalo those who follow it, both high and low ;br, notwithstanding its iniquity, as a di¬version, in England, it is a great disgraceto humanity; and surely none but the mostnotorious gamblers can be elated there¬with, or give a sanction to barbarity, thati «ven shock-s the wild Indian to hear of.—At these scenes of cruelty the greatest de¬predations are committed by the attend¬ants thereon, the most profane and wicked(expressions made use of, the most horridand blasphemous oaths and curses denoun-iced against Fortune for the loss of theirunlawful expectations.( 10 ) ."With respect to other diversions, suts Bowling, Billiards, Tennis &c. th_have each their different pleasures, and ithemselves are very inoffensive, genteeand manly ; hut, like others, are irequecited by gamblers, and therefore to be shurned. The frauds practised intheaboveganiare various and depends much on the skiof the gamester, who becomes proticient bdaily practice, and in order to make a godmarket, can play at them either well or iland gets or loses as lie finds most conducivio his interest; for as he lives by cheatingto lose sometimes may leatftohis winning %others ; or by agreeing to take your part igainst his brother gamblers, which beiniyielded to, he first loses that he may afte*wards win a part of your moqey, w hich ,;divided amongst them w hen you are goneShould you play atthesediversionsjetitbonly for trines; but above all, beware cbettingorengagingin company you youfriends have no knowledge, of ,j for if you dten to one but you are hud, a cant word the:make use of, instead of saying, as thetrutis, w^ have cheated him. ’ . ,• 4*( il )Ij;' • '[sharpers.The Sharper who has got a genteel edu¬cation, and has a good address and conver¬sation, has more the power of delusionthan the unlettered cheat, devoid of addressand other requisites, to complete the pre¬tended gentleman, and therefore should bemore carefully avoided. These villians,having run through their fortunes at an ear¬ly periodoflife, by associating withprofessedgamblers and sharpers, who having easedthem of their money, in return completethem for the profession by which they havebeen ruined j thus qualified, they set up forthemsel ves throw asidehonorandconscience■ land quotethfclextalionis for deceivingothersas they themselves have been deceived.| -These gentry are to be met with at allpublic places of diversion, the Horse-race,' Cock-fight, Billiard, and Hazard tables.—[ 'They pretend to be men of quality or inde->pendent fortunes; many diwhom keep theirnequipages. and fiiles dejoye,avithout afootfnf land, or shilling in the funds, merely bydintofindu5try,in taking in the unthinkingspendthrift,justcometopos^ession of estate,yand so qualifying him for the same laudableprofessiontothe expenditure thereof, to en¬able him to rob through life by the art ofcalculation.—Being, by theory, as well as;constantlpractice,completelproficientsinthedifferent games they play, the cheats areseldom deceived in the skill, and manage¬ment of their antagonists as in a very short,time can discover whether theyareaccompplished professors, or only novices, and ac¬cordingly play the game to advantage.On j’our entering the tavern, coffee orgaming house, the sharper views you withattention, and is not long before he becomesacquainted and very intimate with you.

Their consciencebeing feared, regard less of the censure of theworld, or dictates of humanity, and plunged in different vices, without mortal senti-ment or honor, is it to be wondered at, iteven they cheat their father and brother atplay, much less their friends, acquaintance,and mankind in general.If you associate with sharpers, you mustnot only expect, but deserve to be cheatedby them for your credulity, insufficiencyor stupidity, for who would go with hiseyes open into a den of thieves, but in expectation of being robbed ? Or who wouldherd with Sharpers and not expect to becheated? Therefore my advice is, to shunthese reptiles of the creation, fraught withguile, and artful as the serpent to delude.Beware of their conversation, shun theircompany, take no notice of their tricks andfancies; nor be bought with theirwheedlingprofessions of friendshin : listen not untothem or their enticements, if you would!( 15 )preserve your peace and property. Be not: tond of making new acquaintances with per¬is sons whose characters you are strangers to,! however genteel in appearance and behavi¬our j for many a Sharper lurks under the: disguise of our modern fine gentlemen, as, daily experience fatally shews.SWINDLERS.Of all the vices, frauds, and cheats,i i related and exhibited, there is not one thatI has been more succesful, and of old stand-ing, than that of swindling; which, likeIj the plague, still rages thro’ these kingdomsi with devastation, to the great wrong andij injury of multitudes, both in town andI country. To expose their pernicious prac-ii tices and the bad effects produced thereby,ij may in some measure stop the progress ofij this growing evil and tend to crush the hy-jj dra before it has power to do furtherii mischief: I shall therefore be as exact as!| possible in relating one or two of the mostI glaring and flagrant deceptions practisedo on the unwary, in order to give the readerr, an insight into the nefarious and audacious| proceedings of Swindlers, that they may be16be enabled to prevent any future attemptsof the like nature upon them, by these pestsof society. This new species of knaverycarried on by Swindlers appears specious cin itself, the practisers thereof settingthemselves up for men of property and in- |tegrity, the more easily to defraud the un¬wary and ignorant out of their substance ,and effects ; to obtain which, among many, jthe following is practised : A number ofthem being connected together, take a gen¬teel house in a reputable part of the town, janddividethemselvesintoclassesofmasters,clerks, out-riders, shopmen, porters, andservants. From their making a shew ofopulence, they easily obtain credit, and lay .>n goods of every kind, which, they sendinto the country, and sell or barter forother commodities, which they bring upto London and sell for ready-money, gene¬rally takinginexchangedoublethequantity,and paying for the same with notes of theirown drawing, indorling, and fabricating, forthe purpose of cheating the poor deludedfanner, shop-keeper, and tradesman, in theinterior parts of the conutry. With respectto tradesmen in town, the goods they takeof them on trust, they dispose of to Jews,17and other receiversof stolen goods, at aboutthirty per Cent under value, for ready,money, nay fifty per Cent, rather than notnave the cash: And, as their stay in a placecannot safely be above six months, on ac¬count oftheircreditorscallingin their debts,mdtlleir country notes becoming due, theymake all possible dispatch to dispose of thevarious articles and evacuate the premisesbefore detection. This done, they play thejsame game elsewhere, when, Proteus like,ithey change shapes, and disguise themselvesiso, as not to be known, and carry on ano3ither house, but in a different name andmanner the master becomes the rider, theirider the master, the clerks descend tofootmen and porters, the porters and foot¬men to clerks, and so on throughout, tillf they lu ve drained many parts of town andcountry, to the ruin of many worthy and' honest men in business.These Swindlers have been very artfuli in evading the law, in'negotiating the badnotestheyhavecirculatedabouttliecounirv.The}7 are generally done on copperplates,/[ as neatly as the banker’s : some of themi are drawn at sight, others at u longer or■shorter date, a? suits their conveniency;< 18 )the draper canies them about him all overthe country, and disposes of them, a second ,indorses, a third accepts, but none to pay.But notwithstanding all the arts and in.sinuationsoftheseswindlers, they are easilysingled out in company, from a pretended'hurry in business, and fear of detection;!eyeing every person askance, doubtful ofhaving seen them before.PICKPOCKETS.There are more Pickpockets in andabout London than in all the world beside, tthat make a trade, and what they call acomfortable living by their employment.—The Opera, Play-houses, Capital Auctionsand Public Gardens swarm with them ; ,and of late years, they have introducedthemselvesintoour very churches, in whichthey have not been less successful at a cha¬rity Sermon preached by a Romaine orother noted orator, than at the Theatres, ,at a Benefit, when the principal parts havebeenplayed by a Kemble, Siddons, Jordan, ,Incledon, Munden, and other first rateper-formers, To set forth the different ways(19.)' which they succeed in their nefariouswould be tedious jtheretorelshali(jyiohseive, thatingeneraltwogo togetheric before and the other behind the personhose pocket is to be picked ; the formerf which stops the person either in a croudJ by a pretended accident, while the otherfects the business. Therefore it would bei ndent, when in crouds to keep one handi your money, and the other on yourlatch, when you find any one push against)u: But should you be robbed for wantIt taking proper care to prevent the same,nkeno notice till you see some person nearou stealing away, when you are to secureHim or her, and ten to one but you fix onle right person. You must however, beareful to lay hold of their hands, for fearf their conveying your property to anccomplice who is always ready to receivehe same, and set off with it. Some Pick-ockets are very dextrous in this way, byitroducing their hands without being per-ieived? atothe very bottom of the breeches♦ocket, and taking out the money. Noneivasmoreso,than the celebrated Miss West.‘Dthersinintroducing their hands up ladies’betticoats, taking hold of the pocket, and20 ‘making aVi incision with a knife or scissars.and letting out the contents into thenhands without discovery, which they immediately deliver to their associates with*out stirring from the place, to prevent de* Jtection.Pickpockets do not confine themselves |to London, but travel all over the country,to fairs and horse-races, and are to be metwith on the stands, and in the booths tc fthe experience of many gentlemen and others who have lost purses, watches, rings, *and pocket-books, of which they never re- 'ceived any account. Pocket-books are ‘only secure in the inside pockets, and the ^coat buttoned. Watch chains should be •run through a small loop, contrived for thepurpose securing the watch in the fob,,which many practise. But at these pub¬lic places, it is necessary for all persons ta 15be upon their guard, as they cannot be ig- 1norant of the gentry they have amongst •them, from the many losses sustained bythem.fi21MONEY-DROPERS.These gentry commonly play at the most| public places in town, and also at fairs andcountrymarkets, consisting of threeor morei in company. The dropping of money isl.j the lure to inveigle countrymen into com¬pany, and is accomplished in the followingI manner: The Dropper, when conveniency: suits,, lays down a guinea, or other piece ofi money, close to any country man $ then in| a voiceofexultation,exclaims, I have tonnda guinea ! Upon which a second comes lip,iand says, Where is it? u;, I’ll not believe it.Here it is, cries the former, and, appeals tothe country man for the truth of his pickingit up; who altering in the affirmative,the second claims a share, as they were incompany together: upon which the first re¬torts. If any body has a right to a share,it must be to his honest country man, whosaw it on the ground as well as myself.—I By this time they are arrived at a house ofi resort, and the Droper proposes givingI them a treat out of it, if they will walk in ;If intimating at the same time, that he intends|j to consider the country man as a party con-( as ) ^cerned, who lias a right to share thereof.Tliis bait taking, in they go, observed bythethirdjwhohithertohad appeared to takenonotice of the others, then call for a roomandsomething to dnnk. The Dropper thenasks the countryman if he has gotten anysilver to give in change for the guinea?And according to his answer they ordertheir matters. While they are engaged insharing the money, the third enters, whosits down, without seeming toknowany onepresent or their business. On the Dropper’ssaying, he will go out and get change, thesecond replies, It is scarce worth while forseven shillings $ and seeing a pack of cardson the chimney piece, proposes cutting ofthem for the sum, which the other accepts;the second loses, and the country-man isasked if he will risk his seven shillings, who,thinking he can be nothing out of pocketif he loses, accepts the challenge, and winstwo or three times, when a game of Whistis proposed, and agreed to, if a fourth couldbe found. The pretended stranger says,' ifthey willacceptof a bad player, rather thanspoil sport he will make one. The Dropperand country-man agree to be partners,down they sit; the countryman and his'■If;t1"ivtC 23 )i>artner are successful; they wager on thel:»dd trick the best trump double andtreblehe stakes, till by sad reverse of fortune,he deluded country-man and his artful•artrier are stripped of the last farthing.RING DROPPERS.These are a set of cheats, who frequentlyirick simple people, both from the countryod in London, out of their money ; buttost commonly exercise their villanous artpon young women. Their method of pro*ceding in this : Privately to drop a ring,ast before such personscameup, when theyrcost them as follows : Young woman, Irave found a ring, and believe it is gold,>r here is a stamp upon it. Immediatelypon this, an accomplice joins him, whoteing asked the question replies, It is gold'^ell says the former, as the young ladyiwmepick it up she has a right to half of. As it often happens that the youngterson has but a few shillings on her, the)ropper says, If you incline the ring, younallhave it for what you have got in yourrfjibcket, and what else you can give me,—hichsometimes proves to be a good hand-kerchieft cloak, or other apparel. Th<young woman being just about to take tb Iring, and give the money -and things fbil, the accomplice says. You had bettd'jask a gold-smith if it is gold, but looking {about, he perceives the shop are shut upbeing late. Upon which they conclude iis gold, and part. The deluded creator Ithen shews the ring to a person in thifstreet, who informs her she is cheated b|sharpers, for the ring is not worth twcpence, being only brass guilt, and falsstamp put on to deceive the unwary.The above relation is a fact, and tbjfraud was practised by these pestilent ha Ipies on a young woman in London.To avoid such company in London, muc jmore gaming with them, strangers ougljjconstantly to be on their guard, and inmediately abscond when they meet witsuch characters.FINIS.

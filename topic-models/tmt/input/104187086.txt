In order towhich, we are commanded by </ O Z) toceafc our worldly Labours and common Diver-Jlons on this facred day, that we may themore entirely wait upon GOD, and advanceour Spiritual and Eternal Jnterefts. And thevery nature of the thing /hews us how rea-fonable it is, that we, who mull live for everin another World, fhould fet afide a con-fiderabje Partof our Time to prepare for it.So that on this Holy Day we may, with¬out Breach of Manners, avoid unnectfTaryCompany, refufe impertinent Vifits; andfilence improper difcourfe, that we ma\jenjoy the more full Communion with GOD,and profecute the bufinefs of our holy callingwithout Diftra&ion. And whoever does fo,will find unfpeakable advantages in it, tohis great Comfort in Life and Death.For we are a flu red in the Fourth Com¬mandment, That God hath Blejfed as wellas Confecrated this Day: IVherefore theLord Blefled the Sabbath Day, and hallowedit. So that we oppofe our own Bleflingwhen we negleft the duty of this day, orpollute it by any thing contrary thereto.It is a day of fpecial Grace, wherein theF-ing of Heaven fits on his Mercy Seat, ina more glorious Manner than on otherDays \ having declared that he will be-ftow peculiar Bleflings on them that dulyobferve it. And what true lover of his ownSoul can be wanting in laying hold of foblefled an Opportunity in obtaining favourwith Almighty God, and receiving theRiches of his Grace and Mercy in JefusCbrifi ? Efpecially confidering, that weknow not how few of thefe DaysvJ Salvationmay be granted to us, and how dreadful it isto die in the negledt or prophanation of’em.And let none imagine, that th is was a com¬mandment to the Jews only, and does notreach to us Chriftians; on the contrary, weiind in the New Teftament, that our Lordkeeps up a Title to a Seventh Bay Jlill,which is therefore called the Lord's Day.(Rev. i. 10.) And we find itftridtlyobferv-ed by the Apoftles as a Day of aflemblin-gfor the pubiick Worfhip of God, and Mi-n ill ration of the Word and Sacraments.( dffs 20. 7. ) And we read that our blcfiedSaviourappeared tothem feveral times, andBleffed them on this his Day, ( John 20. ig,26.) and he lent his Holy Spirit upon themon this Day, ( eicfs, 2. 4. j And thereforefince Chriftians are much more obliged now{ than the Jews were ) to the Obfervation ofthis day, by what our BlefTed Saviour hathdone and fuftered in order to our Salvation,we cannot without grofs Abfurdity and in¬gratitude, think that the moral Obligationof it is ceafed. To be of this Opinion, is tooppofe the eftablifhed Orders of our Gover'nours. in Church and State ; and we are re¬quired by pubiick authority to bring thofeto Punifhment, who are found offendingtherein ; and all Chriftians have as muchReafon to r ife up and oppofe fucli as wouldlevel 1 his Holy Day of God with the othercommon days, as they would thofe who are^digging down the Sea Banks; for by Mensbreaking in upon the Limits of this SacredDa), a whole Tide of Vice and Prophane-' ■[ J ]nefs will flow in upon us, to the dishonourof God, the Contempt of Religion, andthe pulling down of Plagues and Calamitiesupon us, which all Men are concerned todo their utmoft to prevent.As our good God therefore has feparatedthis Blejfed Day to his peculiar Service, forhis own Glory, and the good of Men, bothin this world and the next; let us not difap-point thefe gracious ends, by Idlenefs or For-Totality, nor by worldly Bufinefs or carnal Di-verfions. Let no common thing l.eep us frontthe publick. Worlhip of God, either in theFore or. Afternoon -, and let as much of thereft of the day as we can, be fpent in De¬votions of the Clofet and Family j in Cate¬chizing of our Children and Servants, in re¬peating what we heard, in reading goodBooks, in Prayer, finging of Pfalms andgoodDifcourfe. And if thele fweet and bief-fed Exercifes are too tedious and irkfome tous, ’tis enough to affright us to think howunfit we are tor Heaven, where the Loveand Praifes of God make a great Pat t of theglorious Entertainment •, of which the dueKzt'pvagofzCkriJlianSabbalh\'=, the happieftRefemblance that we have upon the Earth.But here, alas! too many among us growuneafie at thefe holy Reftraints*, and beingunaccuftomed to deny themfclvts any thingC * 1t’nat their carnal heart defires on other daysthey know not how to reftrain themfelveson this: And having no inward Relifh ofReligion, they are foon weary of it; andthe-rcfore they ask, what harm there is, ,ifwhen the Publick Serviced over, they fpendthe remainder of the day in recreating them-lelves in the Fields, or in a Publick Houfe,or in any common Diverfion ? yea, fome gofurther, and will not be perfwaded, thatthere is any Haim in Gaming, Foot-Ball,playing at Long-Bowls, Dancing, and theJike, on the remaining Parc of ih\iHoly-Day,But, Sirs, whether you’ll believe it or not,God has [anRifisd this Day ; that is, he hasieparated it to his own peculiar Service,from all our worldly Affairs and Bufinefs ;fo we muft not for that reafon fet it a-partfor eafe and (loth, nor yet for Pleafure andDiverlion, much lefs for Sin, to recreate theBody and to indulge the Lufts thereof, andVanities of this World : For we are fwornagainft thefe in t\\t Sacred Covenant of Bap.tifm, for this Day is principally fet a-parefor the Worfhipand Honour of God^and'the Spiritual Improvement of our Soulsand Preparation for Heaven. And to lofethe blefied Opportunity of this, in publickor private, for either worldly or finful ends,,is a bafe mifpending of our Talent, a ma-C 7 3Contempt of GoJ and his Authority#and a pernicious neglect of our own Salva¬tion : And fuch Perfons as will not be con¬vinced of this now, will be taught rt in avery terrible Manner hereafter.G O D’s Judgments upon Earth againftthe Propbanen of this Day, have been toonumerous and too notorious to be deny’d,which are but as drops of the Storm of thatfiery Indignation "which "Willnt lift all.bis Adverfaries. And furely they cannot beacccumed other than the Enemies of God#and of their own Souls too, who rtjedl theBlpffing of the Lord's Day, by ufing it to aquite contrary end and defign. To preventwhich our Church has required a folemnHumiliation before God for thtProphanali-en of the Day of o'Ur Lord, as well as for Mur*der. Adultery, or any other immoral ActtAs we find in our Liturgy, where, after theRehearfal of the Fourth Commandment, weare required to implore Forgivenefs of Godfor all that we have done'eontrary to thisholy Law of His ; and to pray that Hewou’d give us his Grace, that we may ne¬ver commit fuch grievous Sins any more, mthefe Words : Lord have Mercy upon us,and incline our Hearts to keep this Law.And forafmuch as our Supreme Lawgiverhas in this Law of his required, that fuch asC 8 ]have Strangers within their Gates; that is,Guejis or Lodgers, to look to it that tholeUnder their Roof do not prophane this Sa¬cred Day : How are Inch as keep 7averr;sandPublick Houfes particularly concern’d tof<eep their houfes clear of Company on thisD iy ? Since it appears that we mud anfwerto God for any Prophanation of the Lord'sDay, difcernable and preventable by us,that was committed by thofe under Autho¬rity in our Houfes, wherein, as Governors^we ought to bear rule to the Glory of God.And therefore, however many Maftersof PublickHoufes flatter themfelves with theGains they make by following their Tradesand humouring their Cuftomers on this re-fcrvcd Day of our Lord, they will find avery fad reckoning at laft before the Judgeof all the Earth. When it will be madeappear, that they have fupplied many Per-fons with Inflruments, to fight againfi God,in that they fufFer’d them, to fit drinkingand revelling in their Houfes, whilft theyought to have been at the publick worfhipof God, or to have been employ’d in the pi¬ous government of their own families, andwhatever Priendfliip there now feems to bebetween fuch as livejn thefe pernicious Vi¬ces, and fucb as adminifter fewel to them,it may, at laft, break out into an Eternalt 9 ^Enmity and Avcrfion in the other World,where the one may lay, had you not admit¬ted me into your Houfe, and fupplied mewith Wine and other things, which werenotMatter of Necefiiiy, but mere Vanity andImpiety, I might have kept the ’Lord'sDay better, and efcaped this Place of Tor¬ment. And on the other hand, the otherParty may reply, had you not frequentedmy Houfe on the Lord's Day, and prevent¬ed me and my Servants from ferving Godin his Houfe and my own, we might like-wife have been more happy.That fuch Expoftulations and Upbrai-dings will be like to be in the other world,( where every one will fee the bafenefs andpernicioufnefs of finning againft God ) isvery probable from what we fee in Perionss^hofe Eyes God pleafes to open here onEarth.I knew a Gentleman, who after a fharpSicknefs, betakinghimfelf to a new life, fentfor the Mafter of the Tavern where he hadmifpent much time and many Lords Days,and with fuch a Countenance as made himeven tremble; check’d him feverely for al¬lowing Company, to fit drinking on theLord’s Day, or upon any other Day, to ex¬cels ■, and gave him fuch an tfft&ing Chargeto amend this for the future, as ftartled himwhenever he call’d it to mind ; as the Per-fon to whom he fpake, afterwards confetti[ 31. Say not then, what Harm is there indrawing drink to fuch Perfons as require iton the Lord’s Day? Since if it be unriecelfarvit cannot but be very finful j becaufc at heftit makes both them and you, mifpend theLord’s Diy, and many times occafions veryheinous Diforders and Tranigrtflions on it.2. Say not. You (hall lofe your Trade,and fail of a Livelihood, by oblerving thispart of your Duty; but remember, thatGod rained down a double Portion of Mannaon the Day before the Sabbath, for the Ufeof thofe that obferv’d it, (Exod. 16. 2.9. )and be affur’d that you cannot lofe by yeurfaithful Service to fo good a Mafter,3. Say not. Others do it, and I will norbefingular: Since the Law of God, and notthe Practice of others, muft be our Rule,if we dtfire God’s Kingdom.Lajlly, Say not,That if it be a Sin, Youmuft anfwer for it Yourfelf, and that noBody tile is concerned in it. No ; all pub-lick Sins are publick Offences and Scandals ;that is, they occafion others to fall into Sin,are the common Reproach of Cbrijlianity^and the Caufe of Publick Calamities. Up¬on which Account therefore, all that wouldbe faithful to their Cbrijlian Vows, ought tooppofe the Prophanation of the Lord's Dayby all lawful and advifeable Means; wire-ther it be by giving Information of it to theMagiitrates, or otherwife ; as that whichtends diredtly to the dilhonour of God, theDecay of Religion, and to the DcItrudVionof the Publick Good.We are all ready enough to lay hands onfuch as break any Law which concerns ourfelves. If any one fteals, or robs us of any,little Matter, we alarm the Nighbourhood,and raife all the Power we can to apprehendtheThief, and are at charge to Profecute andpunifh him according to Law: And withoutdoubt we do well in it i for the tolerating fuchOffenders is injuftice to the Publick, and aCruelty to the Innocent. But then, why arewe fo flack and unwilling to do. the like tofuch as Prophane the Holy Day and Name ofGod- Are thefe lighter Matters? Has notGod a Right and Title to his own Day ? Orrather, is it not the true reafon, becaufe weare not fo fenfibleof offences againfl: God asagainft ourfelves. But this is a very bidState, and a fure Sign, that we have not thatl^ove and Zeal for God, which every trueCbrifimn ought to have. Let us thereforerouze up ourfdves to do this Honour toGod, or we fhall never be honoured by him.To fum up all: ‘The Lord's Day is in itsInftitution a Day of Bleffing, and of infiniteGood to Men: But Men may by their Idle-[ ” ]r.efs or Prcphanenefi turn theirinto Curfes. But as this is a great Folly,fo it will end in difmal Sorrow and An-guifh, efpecially when thefe days of theSons of Men are over. When Death dolesupon the day of Grace and Mercy, andthere (hall be no more Sabbaths, norSacraments, nor Sermons, nor Praters forever. Then will the Prophane Perlonwifh in vain for the return of that whichhe hath irreparably loft by defpifing it,like Efau's, begging with Tears (but to noPurpofe) for the Uleffing which he had Soldfor a fenfual Morfel.O my "Brethren! know your ChrijlianPrivileges, improve your Blejfed Sabbaths,and the invaluable Seafons oi God’s Grace.Our day of Life and of Grace is far fpent,and the Flight is at hand.

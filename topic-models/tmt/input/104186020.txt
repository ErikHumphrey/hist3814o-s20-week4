Thou’s want for naething, mybairn, to get thee ready for marriage.The wooing being over and the daybeing set, Jockey’s mither killed theblack boul horned yeal ewe, that losther lamb the last year, three hens andgule-titled stock; to prevent the ripples11i pecks o‘ maut masked in the muckle:irn, a pint o treacle, to mak it thickernd sweeter, and mamier for the mouth ;ve pints of whiskey, wherein was gar-c and spice, for raising the wind. Thei "lends and good neighbours wentalangd’ John to the kirk, where Maggyhanced to meet him, and was marriedy the minister. The twa companiesijjined thegither, and came hame in a:rowd ; and at every change-house theynhanced to pass by, Providence stopty their proceeding with full stoups,t ottles, and glasses, drinking theiri ealths, wishing them joy, ten girls andboy. Jockey seeing so many wishing/ell to his health, coupt up what heusd got for to augment his health, anduar him live long, which afterwardsloupt him up, and proved him detri-diental to the same.So hame they came to the dinner,diere his mither presenting to them apiping het haggis, made of the creesh■ff the black boul horned ewe, boiled inihe meikle pot, mixt with beer meal,cnions, spice, and mint This haggis12being supt warm, the foaming swatsand spice in the liquor set John’s bellya-bizzing like a working vat. His mithercried to spence him, and bed him withthe bride. Pale and ghostly was hisface, and closed were baith his een.Ah ! cries his mither, a dismal day in¬deed, his bridal and his burial may bein. ae day. Some cuist water in his |lace, and jag’d him wi’ the needle, tillhe began to rouse himself up, then lispout some broken words. Mither,mither! cries Jockey, whar am J now ?Whar are you now, my bairn, says hismither, ye are beded, and I’ll bring the Ibride to you. Beded, says Jockey, iand is my bridal done else? Ayis’t, said his mither, and here is thebride come to lie down beside ye, man.Na, na, mither, says Jockey, I’ll nolie wi’ an unco woman indeed, an itbinna heeds an thraws, the way I liewi’ you mither. O fye, John, says hismither, dinna affront yoursel’ and mebaith, tak’ her in o’er the bed ayont ye,and kiss her,and clap her,and dauthertill ye fa asleep. The bride fa’s a-cry-13; ng oot, O mitlier, mither ! whar are ye,I either? Poor thing, Meg thou’s ca’dhy hogs to a bonny market. A bonny. narket! says Jockey’smither; a shamea’ you and her baith, he is worthy ofi ter though she were better nor what: he is, or e’er will be. His friends andler friends being a mixed multitude^ome took his part, some took her’s,then did a battle begin in the elap off i hand, being a very fierce tumult,hich ended in blood; they struck solard with stones, sticks, beetles, andarrow trams; pigs, pots, stoups, andnmd trenchers, v/ere flying like bombsliand grenades; the crook, bouls, andlitangs, were all employed as weapons ofiwar, till down came the bed, with agreat mow of peats ! So this disturbeda’ the diversions at Jockey’s bedding,and the day was beginning to break inthe east before the hurly-burly was over.part ir.Now, though all the ceremonies of1 Jockey and Maggy’s wedding wereended, when they were fairly beddedbefore awrheen rattling unruly witnesses,uwho dang down the bed aboon them ;the battle still increased, and John'swork turned out very wonderful, for hemade Janet, that was his mither’s ser¬vant lass last year, grow like an elshenhaft, and got his ain Maggy wi’ bairnforby. The humsheughs were verygreat, until auld uncle Kabby came into redd them ; and a sturdy auld lellowhe was; he stood lively with a stiffrumple, and by strength of his armsrave them aye sunder, flinging thetaen east and the tither west, till theystood a’ round about like as manyfor-fougten cocks and no ane durststeer another for him. Jockey’s mitherwas ca’d o’er a kist and broke a’ herhip on a round heckle, up she gat,and running to fell Maggy’s mitherwith the ladle, swearing she was themither of a the mischiel that happenedUncle llabby ran in between them, hehaving a muckle nose, like a trumpet,she recklessly came o‘ar his lobster neba drve wi the laddie, till the blood camrinning down his old grey beard, andhang like snuffy bubbles at it. O then15e gaed wild, and looked as woeful likes he had been tod-lorie come fraei worrying lambs, with his bloody mouth,i Vith that he gets an auld flail and:md rives awa the supple, then drives! hem a’ to the back of the door, butane wan out; then wi’ chilling andlapping of hands down comes the clayiialien, and the henbawk wi* Rab Reid; he fiddler, who had crept up besidehe hens, for the preservation of hisMiddle.Ren comes the bride, when she got:>n her coat, clappet Rabby on thei houther, and bade him spare their lives,or their was blood enough shed in ae. light, quo she; and that my beard canwitness quoth he. So they all cameIn obedience to uncle Rabby, for his(upple made their pows baith saft andiiair that night j but daft Maggy Simp-f,on sat by the fire and picked banes a’he time of the battle. Indeed, quothhe. I think ye’re a’fools, but myself,for I came here to get a good supper,|md ither folk hae gotten their skinswell paid.16By this time up got Jock, the bride¬groom that was Jockey before he wasmarried, but couldna get his breeks;and rampling, he cries, Settle ye, orI’ll gar my uncle settle ye, and saftenyour heads wi’ an auld supple.Poor Bab Reid, the fiddler, took asudden blast; some said he was mawturned wi’ the fa’, for he bock’d up a’the barley, and then gar’d the ale gaelike a rainbow frae him, as brown aswort brose.The hurly-burly being ended, andnaething but fair words and shaking of ]hands, which was a sure sign of anagreement, they began to cow theircutted lugs, and wash their sairs, a’ butJockey’s mither, whocriedout, A blackend to you and your wedding baith,for I hae gotten a hundred holes dungin my back wi’ the round heckle teeth.Jockey answers, A e’en baud youwi’ them then mither, ye will e’en bethe better sair’d.Up getsauld Rabby, and auld Sandy,the souter of Seggyhole, and put every¬thing in order; they prapet up the bed,iwi' a rake, and ripsling kamej thestoops bf;ing broken, they made a solid< Ifoundation of peats, laid on the caff bedand bowsters, and Jockey and Maggyi were beded the second time.Jockey not being used to lie wi’ awoman, except heads and thraws wi’his mither, gets his twa hands aboutthe brides neck, and his houghs outo’er her hurdles, saying I ne’er kistwifei nor lass naked before, and for fainnessI’ll bite you, &c.,Naething mail* remarkable happenedtill about half a year and four ouksthereafter, when in comes MarionMushes, rinning barefitted and bare¬legged, wi’ blear’t cheeks and waterynose, cursing and banning, greetingand fly ting.(Marion enters, crying,}1 And whar’sJohn ?Miih.

Nosooner had they entered the door butMaggy fa’s a greeting and wringing herhands, Jockey’s mither fell a-flyting,and he himself a-rubbing his lugs, andriving his hair, crying out, Ogin I werebut half an ell higher, I sud be a sodgeror it be lang; gie me a guid flail or acorn fork, I wud kill Russians anew,before I gaed to face yon flyting Minis¬ters and be set up like a warld’s wonder,on their cock-stool, or back stool; andI23flwha can hide the shame when everybody looks to them, wif their sackenisarks, or gown, on them, like a pieceof auld eauvas prickt about a body, fornaething bnt what every body does a-maist or they are married as weel as meMilh.

Indeed, sir, I wad think naething to stan’ a time oitwa on the black stool, to please you, if there were naebod]in the kirk, on a ouke day, but you and the elders to flyte swee on me; but ’tis waur on a Sunday to have a’ bodieslooking and laughing at me, as I had been codding the peasisipping the kirn, or somethirye to the stool it’s nothing when it is over, we cannot say,o’er muckle to- you about it.On Sunday thereafter, John comes with Uncle Rabby'sauld wide coat, a muckle grey lang-tailed wig, and a bigbonnet, which covered his face, so that he seemed more-like an old pilgrim than a young fornicator! mounts thwcreepy wi’ a stiff back, as he had been a man of sixty.Every one looked at him, thinking he was some old:stranger, who knew not the stool of repentance by another'seat, unknown but to very few; yet, or the second it becameito be well known, that the whole parish and many more, cameito see him which caused such a confusion, that he wasabsolved, and got his children baptized the next clay,—butthere happened a tullie between the twa mothers’ who would■would have both their names to be John.

Now John, you must never kiss another woman,but your own wife; live justly, like another honest man, andyou will come to die well.Jock. A black end on me, sir, if ever I lay wi' anotherwoman, as lang as our Maggy lasts; and for dying, there'snae fear of that, or I’ll no get fair play, if yc and a’ the aulderfolk in the parish be not dead before me. So I hae done wi'you now, fareweel, sir.Min. Aweel John, never

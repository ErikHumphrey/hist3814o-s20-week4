For, to ufe the IV>rds of a certainAuthor, The glorious Power, theunfearchableWifdom, the wonderful Order fhining in thewhole Procedure of the whole fix Days Work,,who dare undertake to declare ? Only what wecannot fufficiently comprehend, let us praifeand admire. And upon mature Confideration,we will find juft Catife for Praife and Admira¬tion, with regard both to the Works of Creationand Redemption.As to the Performance itfelf, if it has any thing -of the Spirit or Beauties of Poetry, it is entirelythe Fruit of a natural Genius; for the Authoringenucufly acknowledges, that he had not theOpportunity of the more polite and refined Edu¬cation, which might have greatly brightened the )fGenius of his Mufe : For which frank Acknoui- ;iedgment he hopes the nicer or more learned Rea- iders will be the more readily induced to excuf s!or difpenfe with any thing therein that doth not \keep Pace with the find Rules of the Schools» ;and if the Thoughts be in the main juft and true,that Allowances will be granted in other Cafes. JA(I)APOEMOK THECreation of the World jFirji on the Eternity, Independency, Self-fufficiency of the Divine Being, and of theeternal Springs and Caufes of the Crea¬tion in the Deity.THE Heavens, the Earth, the Sea, andall therein,Were all created, and did once begini r"nr* h iva rho*eternal but the Lord of Hofts,/v no ever was from all Eternity;».i The which to us is fuch a Myftery,r Tho’finite M inds ihould try this Depth to found,3y them its Bottom never would be found :This Ocean huge no Creature can explore,That knows no Brim, no Bottom, nor a Shore.However far beyond our Reach and View,We from the Scriptures are allur'd ’tis true,i. That he did fpend Eternity alone,*Vhen other Beings but himfelf were none.To have a Being: So that none canboaftAi( * )Spendmg alone thus an Eternity,It fully proves his Self-fufficiency,And that before he made this earthly Frame,Jis after that, was ftill unchang’d the fame.Still inhimfelf of Happinefs pofleft,That could ne’er be diminifh’d or increaft.To God’s eflential Glory, tho’ ’tis true.From all his Works there nothing does accrue;Yet fearch the Scriptures, and enquire the Caufe,God made the World, and all created was;iThe Reafon for it there we fee aflign’d,Is God, his Glory in it all defign’d;His fovereign Will and Pleafure being theThingWhenceall hedoes doth takeitsRifeand Spring.And tho’ his Glory is not thus increaft,It is declar’d, and is made manifeft.That he is glorious; all his Creatures (hew. it,Altho’ they do add no Addition to it.The Divine Goodnefs, like a Fountain feal’d^Had been, if not thus open’d and reveal’d,God’s Power and Wifdom which before werehidThem in Creation manifeft he did : .Angels and Adam were made fo divine.That Holinefs did here with Luftre Ihine;That Man of his Creator might ftand Awe,For him then Juftice did enadt a Law,With Promife, Precept, and a Penalty;T’ obey was Life, but if not, he muft dy.While Truth engaged was he ihould be ferv’d,Which ever Way it was his Works deferv’d.Into Creation-Work we may fee thereThefe Attributes of Glory each had Share:’Tis( 3 )’Tis true that Mercy feem’d obfcure, and here?Did Mercy follow only in the Rear, >Till jldam fell it did not much appear. 3Redemption-Work doth in a Strain more highEach Attribute extol and glorify;Yet this much of Creation'we may fay.That it did for Redemption-Work make way;Man muft be made, fall, and be guilty deem’d.Before he need or yet could be redeem’d:So I deiign a few Lines on that Head,That’s firft recorded in the Chriftian Creed;There’s in this Work of God the World’sCreation,Great Room for Words, yet more for Admi¬ration ;God’sPower and Wifdom herefo manifold,?Its Half by none can never well be told, rOnly by Faith ’tis here we may behold jHim ftepping forth, without either a Stone,Or any thing to build with, or upon:This Univerfe fo huge he up did rear.And out of nothing made it all appear ;Creating Power did make fuch Operation,’ 71In going thro’ this great Work of Creation, £•Yet keeped Order, Beauty and Gradation, VAnd did begin and end, as Scripture fays.It all within the Compafs of fix Days.’Tis proper then we Ihould in this Eflay,Begin with what was done on the firft Day,And ftill advance, as Scripture Light doth (hew.Of each Day’s Work to take a (hort Review.But Oh I the Works on thir fix Days werewrought.Them to defcry furpafleth human Thought!A 2 Who,( 4 )Who, who can know the Creatures Numbervaft.From the firft made, to Woman who was laftOf all the Creatures that we read of made;Which done, the World then was finifhed.When God unto the Univerfe gave Birth,And did create the Heavens and the Earth,He in this Work did with himfelf begin.That lofty Place to make he dwelleth in;Altho’ he be God prefent every where,His glorious Prefence it i$ only there;It is in Heaven the third and higheft Story,Which Scripture calls the Place of Biiifs andGlory.But this Imperial Seat of Majefly,Who here below its Glory can defcry ?We find recorded are in facred Writ,Many and various Metaphors of it.This glorious City, as in Scripture fafd.His twelve Foundations, which Jehovah laid;An equal Number alfo has of Gates,At each of which a glorious Angel waits:The Wall of it, fays the Apoille John,Is garnifhed with every precious Stone:That City mu ft be fplendid to behold,That is compar’d to pure and precious Gold;Its very Streets are faid to be no lefsThan Gold fo pure, that’s like tranfparent G lafs.Of Sun or Moon this City hath no need,Which doth for Light the glorious Sun exceed.’Tis doubted much if this third Heaven wasAt all compris’d in the confufed Chaos.But fince that its Created Glory lies.Quite out of Sight from all belov* the Skies,( ? ) .And none being fit its Glory to declare,But who arc blelt with Habitation there.Then ftopiny Mufe,thyjudginentthen fufpend•About the Thing thou cannot comprehend.The Angels, Heaven’s Inhabitants, even theyCreated were alfo on the firft Day;For when the Earth’s Foundation it wras laid,We read in S-oripture, that ’tis of them faid, ’That at its laying they did fo rejoice,They fung together with united Voice:Thefe Creatures were made Beings fo refin’d,Yet a Degree above the human Kind;And by the Effe& of creating Power,Angels were made entirely Spirits pure,•That have noSubfiance that’s of ought we callFlefli, Blood or Bones, or Ought material.The great Creator’s Power to teftify,The Angels all were made immediately:Alfo the Lord, their great Creator, heMade them immortal by Divine Decree;And he who’s Sovereign of his Ways, to noneHas to account but to himfelf alone,Was pleafed to exalt thefe Creatures fo,Above all Creatures that he made below,And dignified them fo above the reft.That they of Heaven were at firlt poffefl;They were admitted to thut high Abode,To ferve in Prefence of the Lord their God,Who did them make fo fit for that Defign,He them endow’d with Qualities divine,Of a vaft Meafure he did them pofiTefsOf divine Wifdom, Power and Holinefs,By which they were enabled to fulfilWhatever was their great Creator’s Will;C <5 )Yet God referv’d ImmutabilityAs his own lingle fpecial Property,Nor unto Men or Angels either, thatWhen he them made, did it communicate.Thus many Angels they did foon rebel, 7And from Allegiance to their Sovereign fell,>And out of Heaven were thruft down to Hell, jAnd are fhut up in Darkncfs and Defpair,Without all Hopes of any Mercy there:The reft confirm’d were by a divine Hand,That in Perfe&ion hence they’ll ever ftand;They in that high and happy State aboveAre now infur’d, they’ll never thence remove:Such Honour great unto them there is giv’n,Such grand Employment in the Court ofHeav’n,In executing God’s Decrees, are henceGreatly employed in Works of Providence,And in his Errands, O how foon can theyThemfelves from Heaven unto Earth convey!None can exprefs the great RapidityAnd Swiftnefs they from Place to Place do fly, 'In executing of their Lord’s Commands;No Oppofition e’er before them Hands,Thro’ Bars of Iron and thro’ Gates of Brafs,As thro’ the Air, with equal Eale they’ll.pafs,In Houfe or Field, or in whatever Place,They take no Room, nor fill up any Space.In Works of Judgment, thus much Scripturefays,They’re oft employ’d, yet are not fo always;For even in Works of Mercy they alfoAre oft employed about the Saints below.It was from Angels Abraham and LotOf Sodom's Ruin Information got.Jacob,( 7 )Jacob, Elijah and Eli/bah, theyWere much beholden to them in their Day;Gideon, Manoah, Ezekiel, Daniel too,Great things the Lord by Angels did them (hew.Jofeph and Mary, Parti and Peter m iyHave on this Subje& very much to fay.Much on this Head there might be now expreft,Which Scripture doth in divers Parts atteft;Yea, all thefe Spirits, as the Word declares,Do minifter unto the heavenly Heirs;Thus with a fecret and an unfeen HandDo them more good than what they underftand.Ezekiel's Vifion doth declare and (howHow inftrumental they’re in things below.In fine, the Angels, tho’ but finite Creatures,Exceed us far, to comprehend their Natures.My Lines about them therefore I will end,And from fuch Heights as thir I’ll now defcendUnto the World below, where there do lyThings that appear more obvious to our Eye.It feems plain from what’s in Scripture faid.The Earth’s Foundation the firit Day was laid;,God by one Word did form the Fabrick fairA4out of nought, then hang’d it in the Air,So fure and (table yet he did it make,It there’s no Power, except his own, can (hake :He it with all it in its Heart doth hold 7With all within its Bowels is inroll’d, >Veins of Silver or of precious Gold; jWith all the various Metals that we find.So vaftly ufeful for the human Kind ;The huge Store of Coal that in it doth ly, JWhich doth with Fuel richly us fupply, fWhen once obtained by Men’s Induftry. SThe( 8 )The liquid Deep, the which did then fun over.The Earth’s Surface, and it entirely cover ;Thefe Fountains great of Water did proceedOn the firft Day from God their Fuuntain*head :He Earth and Waters on this Day did make,Both from his Hand their Origin did take.But at this Time the Earth, the Air and Water,Were all but one confufed Heap of Matter;The cold, the hot, the temp’rate, moift and dry,In one profound confufed Heap did ly;A monitrous Face the new Creation wears,And void of Order, Form, and Light appears,Till'God who call’d the Chaos out of nought.From thence all things to Form and Orderbrought;In Order firlt a glorious God of MightFrom this Contulion he extra&ed Light,When by a Word mod powerful and divine.He out of Darknefs made the Light to fhine;Let there be Light, he faid, and prefentlyThe Light fprang up, and made the Darknefs fly.Whole glorious Rays did chafe the fame away,For all the Time and Seafon of the Day.Then Divine Order did allow the LightTo give the Darknefs Place again at Night,Wrich by alternate Turns of Night and Day,While Time (hall laft toother (hall give way;As things of contrar Nature oft fet forth,And recommend their Excellence and Worth,The Excellence of Light from thence vve learn,When we the Darknefs of the Night difeern;But by what Mean the Lord on this firll DayDid then this Light unto the World difplay.( 9 )This to define, I verily fuppofe.There is no Creature, but the Angels, knows.But by what Mean, or whatfoever thing,The Lord made Light upon this Day to fpring.We’re fure that Light, that pure and preciousCreature,Is the moft ancient of the Works of Nature;And fo it may be called God’s firft born,Which doth all Beauties of the Earth adorn.This Creature, Light, we juftly may admire*Its bears fuch Likenefs to its heavenly Sire;Making of which, the Lord did then concludeThe firft Day’s Work, and then did call itgood.The Waters now which at this Time did foO’er all the Surface of the Earth o’erflow.As if the World an Ocean it had been.And then no Spot of Land was to be feen.The fecond Day a Firmament fo wide,The Lord did make the Waters to divide;On which expanded Firmament and Air,The Waters running on Earth-Surface there:From off the Earth Part of them then wasydrain’d jUp to the Clouds exhal’d, and there con- Itain’d, rTill at God’s Pleafure down again they’re [rain’d. JAnother Part of thefe muft fink and goUnto the fubterranean Caves below.What ftill remain’d on Earth, the Lord didmake tUnto their proper Channels to betake;Difpers’d them into lefs or more Degrees,Of running Water, Rivers, Lakes and Seas.B When( 1° )When of the Waters God had thusdifposM,Then the new^Earth its naked Head difclos’d.The Sea beinp plac’d around upon each Hand,Its fwclling Waves itivirons every Land;Tho’ it would feem a moft unruly Creature,»Tis yet obedient to the God of Nature :It when fequeftrate from the Land, did feemAs if it would with one impetuous StreamBreak over all its Boundaries, and foThe Earth again entirely overflow :But divine Power did prove to it a Let,And Bars and Doors into its Way did fet.A Cloud its Garment made the divine Hand,And Darknefs thick to it a Twaddling Band.In fine, the Lord hath by divine DecreeSet Bounds unto the raging of the Sea;Thus far (hould come, us great Creator fil'd,And here (hall even thy proudeft Waves be (laid.Creation-Work thus far a length muft be,Own’d great indeed in its Kind and Degree;How great foever here btlow, ’tis whatEntire!y’s dead, and quite inanimate.Some thing more worthy of him yet remain’d.In whom the Fountain of all Life’s contain’d.In all the World there’s nothing growingfound.It lies as yet a Piece of empty Ground:This murt not be; it is too large a Field,For to ly barren, and thus nothing yield.How foon the Cafe thus alter’d was, we mayFind by what God did do on the third Day.When on this Day the Earth thus to prepare,Now from the Waters feparate, and thereFor( ” )For Man that was to be created, itMight then be made a Habitation fit;God’s Being, the Fountain of all Virtue, now,And Power at once he did proclaim, an^ IhewHimfelf the God of Nature; yet that heOf all its Rules was abfolute and free:Th* Almighty Agent every way above.And independent of them all to prove;Or e’er the Earth the Husbandman did know.Or any Labour on’t he did bellow,One Drop of Rain or Dew did on it fall,Or with the Sun-beams warmed was at all.He bleft it with fuch great Fertility,Herbs, Trees and Plants it brought forth in-ftantly;The Oak, the Cedar, the afpiring Pine,Shoots quick to Heaven, and meets the Worddivine:Nor no Delay was now of Day or Year,’T ween Trees being planted and their Time tobear,But all at once were laden and decor’d,With manifold ripe Fruits were richly ftor’d;Herbs, Plants and Flowers fo fragrant, frefliand fair.As might perfume and fcent the very Air.The Lord this Day did fo adorn the Field,And made it fuch a Store of Beauties yield.That Solomon in all his grand ArraySo great a Glory never could djfplay.A Summer-Houfe moft pleafant/4<4»» wou’dIn Eden's Garden, of it furely had.In which he might have liv’d, until he’d evenExchang’d it for a better Place in Heaven.B i Yea,( II )Yea, O what Pleafure might we all liv’d inThis World, had not the curs’d Wind of SinUpon it been permitted thus to blow,And all its Beauty thus defaced fo!Again the Lord he did on the fourth DayThe Firmament of Heaven then array,And did befpangle it with the glorious Sun,The Moon and Stars all in their Courfe to run.As for the Light on the firft Day, that wasExtra&ed firft from the confufed Mafs,The Lord ordain’d thefe Beams of Light andFireShould all into one ftiining Orb retire.Which to Earth’s different Quarters fhoulddifpenfeHis fhining Rays and warming Influence.And this great Light immenfely bright and gay,The Lord ordained for to rule the Day;The Moon again, which is the leffer Light,The Lord ordained for to rule by Night.It both from Senle and ficred Writ appearsThefe Lights divide our Seafons, Days andYears;The radiant Sol with certain circuiting,Makes Summer, Winter, Autumn and theSpring,He always long or (hort doth make our Days,As he withdraws or vifits with his Rays.For one Half-year he doth the fame increafe,The other Half diminifh and make lefs:Two Times each Year the Sun he doth divideOur Days and Nights equal on either Side;One Month in th’ Year he more than fixteenHoursDifplays his Light and Heat about our Bowers;Another( 13 )Another Month there is each Year, he thenDoth little more than fix with us remain,j ‘ Thofe dwelling under th’Equinodial, they‘ Have all the Year long equal Night and Day;4 Thofenear theTropicks have them more un¬even,‘ The more, the more that they are Norwarddriven:4 But thofe whofe Tents to either Pole are near,4 Have but one Night and one Day in a Year,4 Yet all well compafs’d by due ruled Rite,4 Neither, than other, hath more Dark or Light.*Thus there’s no Nation, Kindred, Tongue norSpeech,But what fome tim£ he Light to them doth reach;Likewife-the Moon and Stars of Heaven, alfoHave all their proper Influence below.Thus unto every Ordinance of HeavenAn Order’s by the God of Nature given,Each doth the Courfe that is aflign’d them fleer.According to each Seafon of the Year.This newly lighted Lamp of Heaven, the Sun, ^On this fourth Day to fhine had new begun, fSet out his Race and Circuit for to run. jThe Day preceeding, as before was faid,With Grafs and Trees the Earth fqrich array’d.When on the Flowers he downward did dif-penfeHis fhining Rays and warming Influence,His Beams that fuch a radiant Luftre have,A new Addition to their Splendor gave.Sun,f Sylvefler.( '4 )Sun, Moon and Stars, now all and each ofthemDo fo adorn and paint the arched Frame;In Order next, on the fifth Day, the LordWith living Creatures Air and Waters fior’d.When on this Day the Region of the Air,The proper Place for flying Motion there.Cutting their Way towards the Cryftal Sky,The winged Choir with painted Wings do fly.Who can defcribe the Sizes of them all,From the great Eagle to the Wren fo finall!And fome of them there is that fmaller beYet than the Wren, and of a lefs Degree;And as they are of many various Kind,So by their Natures yarioufly inclin’d;For fome among them there are to be foundThat only fit and chatter on the Ground,While others do afcend the Trees and fing, ?And make the Woodsand Valleys all to ring,rDuring the Time and Seafon of the Spring.

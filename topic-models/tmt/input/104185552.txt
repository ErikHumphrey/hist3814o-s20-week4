They must go outhand in hand, with eyes shut, and pull the firstthey meet with; its being big or little, straight orcrooked, is prophetic of the size and shape of thegrand object of all their spells—the husband orwife.

Others omit the harrowing, and say,‘ Come after me and harrow thee.’10 'Then up gat fecbtin Jamie Fleck,And he swore by his conscience,That he cod id saw hemp-seed a peck,For it was a’ but nonsense.The auld gudeman raught down the peek,And out a handt'u’ gied him;Syne bad him slip frae ’mang the fock,Some time when nae ane see’d him".And try’t that night.He marchesHhrough amang the stacks.Though he was something startin ;The graip he for a harrow taks,And bauds at his curpin :And every now and then, he says,‘ Hemp-seed, I saw thee ;And her that is to be my lass, ■Come after me, and draw thee.As fast this night.’H^ whistled up Lord Lennox’ march.To keep his courage cheerie,Although his hair began to arch,• He was sae fley’d and eerie:Till presently he hears a squeek,And then a grane and gruntle!He by his shouther gae a keek,And tumbled wi’ a wintleOut-owre that night.*We roa; ’d a horrid murder-shout,In dreadful desperatipn !And young and auid came rinnin out,To hear the sad narration:He swore ’twas hilchin Jean M‘Craw,Or crouchie Mcrran Huraphie,tiTill, stop ! she trotted through them •':And wha was it but G’-umphie,Asteer that night.Meg fain wad to the barn hae gane,To win’ three wechts o’ naetning;*Bin for to meet the deil her lane,She pat but little faith in :.She gies the herd a pickle nits,And twa red cheekit apples,To watch, while for the barn she sets,In hopes to see Tam KipplesThat vera night.She turns the key wi’ cannie thraw,And owre the threshold ventures;But first on Sawnie gies a ca’,Syne bauidly in she enters:A ratton rattled up the wa’,And she cried, L—rd preserve her !* This charm must likewise be performed un-perceived and alone. You go to the barn, andopen both doors, taking them eff their hinges, ifpossible; for there is danget; that the being aboutto appear, may shut the doors, and do you somem ischief. Then take that instrument-used in win¬nowing the corn, which, in out country dialect, wecail a weebt, and go through all the attitudes ofletting down corn against the wind: Repeat itthree times, and the third time an apparition willp.iss throngh the barn, in at the windy door, and-out at the qther, having both the figure in question,and the appearance and retinue marking the «sa-pl.oyment or station in life.And ran through midden-hole and a’,- And pray’d wi’ zeal and fervour,Fu’ fast that night.They hoy’t out Will, wi’ fair advice,They hecht him some fine braw ane :It chanc’d the stack he faddom’t thrice,*Was timmer-propt for thrawin.:He taks a swirlie auld moss oak,For some black, grousome carlin:And loot a winze, and drew a stroke,Till skin in blypes cam haurlinAff’s iiieves that, night.A wanton widow' Leezic was,As cantie as a kittlin ;But, och ! this night, amang the shaws,She gat a fearfu’ settlin !She through the whins, and by the cairn,And o’er the hill gaed scrievin,Whar three lairds’ lands met at a burn,fTo dip her left sark-sleeve in,Was bent that night.* Take an opportunity of going, unnoticed, to abv ar-stack,' and fathom it three times round.

lunish matter for some rhymes.I’ll tell a taie o’ former time' : —A farmer, near the east nook o’ i e,W as ca;lied afl'in prime o' life.And left a widow fu’ o’ grief,Her sorrow real, but unco briefAt'first nae comfort tfouid she hem.Frac scripture, or frae reason cleat;* Sowans, with Vytter instead of niilk to thetais always the llaiio* e’en supper.II/Although the priest, and her neist elder,In pointed language plainly tell’d her,—‘ We’re here the day—awa* to-morrow,Nor should be swallow’d up wi’ sorrow/After a short, but decent season,The widow thus began to reason‘ Why should I for a husband mourn,Will grectin gar the man return/Now, though her storm o’ grief blew over.She didna turn a wanton lover;Although it also must be granted,Anither husband soon she wanted:But this was only on condition.Of asking the divine permission.Full sax lang weeks were gane and p*»t,After the farmer breath’d his last,When, having clos’d her house affairs,Ae e’ening she was at her prayers.Twas in the barn,—the usual place,—Whare loud she pray’d for gear and grace.Here then she wrestled hard and fervent,That God would pity his puir servant;As her dear husband now had left her,And o’ ae comfort had bereft her;As he was ane o’ her ain chusing,And really ane amang a thousand.She pray’d, if such was Heaven’s decree,Anither just as gude as heMight influenced be to court her,Nor wad she keep him lang i» torture;But mak him happy, wi’ her haun,Wi’ stock' and farm at his commauh.The righteous’ prayers availed) much,And Maggie's prayers were really such.Her servant m m, a sturdy chield,As ever swung a flail or teild,16In secret truly did adore her,Was ae night in the barn before her;Wi’ nae d ~ign to interrup’ h^r,But shake some strae the beast to supperWhen in comes Margaret, stark and stoutiAnd to her prayers began devoutly,And after seeking spiritual things.The married state about she brings.Jock in a corner lay fu’ snug,Lending an eager tentie lug:He, being a fad o’ ready wit,Conceiv’d a wise and lucky hit,To work on Maggie’s superstition.And thus accompjish his ambition.A sheet lay huddled in the nook,Which Jock bn this occasion tcok,To deed himsel’ in snawy white,And personate an angel bright.The silver moon shone in her vigour,When, by the bole, Meg saw the figure.In accents solemn, deep and hollow,Her close attention he made follow:—Thy prayers are heard, and shall be granted,Nor shall a husband lang be wanted:’ It therefore is the will o’ God,That you should tnafry Johnnie Tod;Though he be but your servant man,And neither has a pat nor pan;He’s young, religious, chaste, and thrifty,And acts just like a man o’ fifty.By day wi’ care he’ll sort your farm,By night he’Jl daut and keep you warm.’The widow maist was in a trance, Sir,At hearing sic a gracious answer.Jeck reach’d the kitchen, unperceiv’d,And quietly at his stocking weav’d;17W han in the widow comes fu’ prim,And lovingly she looks at him.‘Johnnie, my manl yon’ll see but dimly,Working ahint the cradle chimly;The backside ribs are cauld and dark,And you hae bain a sair day’s wark.Come roun’, and fill the twa-arm chair;And here’s the kebbuck,—tak your sair :Frae this time forth, believe me, John,i lious never get a cheeseless scone.’The lasses at their wheels were linkin’,And scarce could keep frae nods and winkin’,'1 hey thought it was a matter oddlike,To hear their mistress hint sae broadlike;For baith o’ Jock had some daft notion,Baith lang had been at his devotion;Lang to his wants they had attended,And aft his sarks and breeks had mended;And mopy a dunt o’ cheese and bread,And mony a cake o butter spread,And mony a cog o’ cards and cream,i They steal’d to fill his craving wame;I But now baith fear’d ’twas labour lost,5 And that their love wad soon be cross’d. .John soon, wi’ manners mild and honest,] Improv’d his mistress’ hints the broadest.J* ithin ae fleeting month he wed his charmer,jnd liv’d and died a much respeckit farmer.SCOTCH

THEMadrid Shaver’sADVENTURESIN THESPANISH INQUISITION.The Madrid Shaver.XJICOLAS? PEDROSA, a busy little being,-L^l who followed the trade of tharer, sur¬geon, and man-midwife in the town of Madrid,mounted his mule at the door of his shop in thePlazuela de los Affligidos. and pushed throughthe gate of San Bernardino, being called to apatient in the neighbouring village of Foncarral,upon a pressing occasion. Every body knows,that the ladies in Spain, in certain cases, do notgive long warning to practitioners of a certaindescription, and nobody knew it better than Ni¬colas, who was resolved not to lose an inch ofhis way. nor of his muic’s best speed by theway, if cudgelling could beat it out of her. Itwas plain to Nicolas s conviction, as plain couldb<-, that his road lay straight forward to the lit¬tle convent in front i 'he mule was of opinion,that the turning on the left down the hill towaidsthe Prado, w s the road of all toads most fami¬liar and agreeable to herself, ^nd accordingly be-Tvm to dispute the point cf topography with Ni¬colas. by fixing her forefeet resolutely in theground, dipping her head at the same time be¬tween them, and launching heels and crupperfuriously into the air, in the way o argument.Liitle Pedrosa, who was armed ai-heel wiU onemassy silver spur, ot stout thouglf ancient work¬manship, re.cltuejy applied the rusty rowel to3'the shoulder of his beast, and at the same time,adroitly tucking his blue cape under his right arm,and flinging his skirt over his left shoulder en ca.'M/ter, began to lay about him with a stout ashensapling, upon the ears, pole, and cheeks, of the•recreant mule. The fire now flashed from aipair of Andalusian eyes, as black as charcoal, andmot less inflammable, and taking the segara fromihis mouth, with which he had vainly hoped toihave regaled his nostrils in a sharp winter’s even-ung by the way, raised such a thundering troopof angels, saints, and martyrs, from Saint Mi¬chael, do%vnwards, not forgetting his own name¬sake St. Nicolas de Tolentino, by the way, th’tiif Curses could have made the mu'e to go, theidispute would have been soon ended; but not artsaint could make her stir any other ways than;.upwards and downwards ac a stand (\ smallitroop of mendicant friars were at this momentiiconducting the host to a dying man.—« NicolasPedrosa, says an old friar, ‘ be patient with your•beast, and spare your blasphemies-, rememberIBalaam.’—‘ h! father,’ replied P, drosa, ‘13a-■laam cudgelled Ins beast til! she spoke, so will furiine ‘ill she roars.’—‘ Fie, fie, prophane fellow,’icries another ol the fraternity. ‘ Go abour yourwork, friend,’ quoth Nicolas, ‘and let me go[about mine j L warrant it is the more pressing of!the twoj your patient is going out of the world,amine is coming into it.’ Hear him/ cries a|!third, ‘ hear the vi'e wretch how he blasphemesrthe body of God.’ And then tlvs troop passedllslowly on to.the tinkling of the bell.A man must know nothing of a mule’s ears,who does not know wrist a passion they Eave far ithe tinkling of a bell; and no sooner had the:jisgling chords vibrated in the sympathetic or--guns of Pedrosa’s beast, than bolting forwardwith a sudden spring, she ran roaring into thethrong of friars, trampling oft some, and shoul¬dering ethers, at a prophane rate; when Nicolasavailing himself of the impetus, and perhaps notable to comtoul it, broke away, and was out ofsight in a moment. ‘ All the devils in hell blowfire into thy tail, thou beast of Babylon, mut¬tered Nicolas to himsef, as he scampered along,never once looking behind him, *r stopping toapologiz-’ for the mischief he had done to the barefeet and shirtless ribs of the holy brotherhood.Whether Nicolas saved his distance, as like¬wise, if he did, whether it was a male or a fe¬male Castilian he ushered into the world, weshall not just now' inquire, contented to awaithis return is the first of the morning, next day,when he had no sooner dismounted at his shop,a^d delivered his mule to a sturdy Arragonesewench, than Don Ignacia de bantos Aparicio,Alijuaiil-mayor of the supreme and general in-qmsiiion, pm an order into his hand, signed andse.ied by the Inq^iror-general, lor the convey¬ance of his body to tile Casa, whose formidabledoor presents itself in the street adjoining to thesquare in which Nicolas’s brazen basin hungforth, the emblem of his trade.The pc or little fellow, trembling in every joint,and with a f’ce as yellow as saffron, dropt a k eeto ihe altar which fronts the entrance and cros¬sed himself most devoutly: as soon as he haa as-: cended the first fligfi- of stairs, a porter habitedin black opened the tremendous oarrisade, and! Nicolas, with horror, heard the grating of the| heavy bolts that shut him in. He was ledi through passages, and vaults, and melancholycells, till he was delivered into the dungeon,where he was finally left to his solitary medita¬tions. Hapless being ! what a scene of horror 1Nicolas felt all the terrors of his condition, hutbeing an Andalusian, and, like his countrymen,of a lively imagination, he began to turn over allthe resonrees of his invention for some happyfetch, if any such might occur, for helping himout of the dismal limbo he was in: he had notlong to seek for the cause of his misfortune; hisadventure with the barefooted friars was a readysolution of all difficulties of that nature, had therebeen any; there was, however, another thingwhich might have troubled a stouter heart thanNicolas’s—he was a Jew. This, of a certain,would have been a staggering item in a poordevil’s confession, but then it was a secret to allthe world but Nicolas, and Nicolas's consciencedid not then'urge him to reveal it. He now be¬gan to overhaul the inventory of his personalsabout him, and with some satisfaction countedthree little medals of the blessed Virgin, twoAgnus Deis, a Saint Nicolas de Tofentino, anda formidable string of beads, all pendant fromhis neck, and within his shirt; in his pockets, hehad a paper of dried figs, a small bunaile of se-gars, a case of lancets, squirt and forceps, andtwo old razors in a leathern envelope ; these hehad delivered one by one to the alguazil, who6first arrested him—f and let him make the most jof them/ said he to himself, * they can never -prove an Israelite by a case of razors.’ Upon a :closer rummage, however, he discovered in a .secret pocket, a letter, which the Alguazil hadoverlooked, and which his patient Donna Leon¬ora de Casafonda had given him in charge to de¬liver as directed.—‘ V\ ell, well/ cried he, ‘ letit pass; there can be no mystery in this harmlessscrawl a letter of advice to some friend or rela¬tion ; I’ll not break the seal; let the fathers read fit, if they like, 'twill prove the truth of my de- 'position, and help out my excuse for the hurryof my errand, and the unfortunate adventure ofa damned refractory mule.’—And now no soon¬er had the recollection of the wayward mule cros¬sed the brain of poor Nicolas Pedrosa, than hebegan to blast her at a furious rate. * The «crat-ches and the scab to boot confound thy scurvy ■hide/ quoth he, ‘ thou ass-begotten bastard,whom Noah never let into his ark ! The ven¬geance t-ke thee, for an uncreated barren beastof promiscuous generation? What devil’s crot-chet got into thy capricious noddle, that thourhouldst fall in love with that Nazaritish bell,and run bellowing like Lucifer into the midst ofthose barefooted vermin, who are more malici¬ous and more greedy than the locusts of Egypt ?Oh ! that I had the art of Simon Magus to con¬jure thee into th:s dungeon in my stead ; but Iwarrant thou art chewing thy barley straw with¬out any pity for thy wretched master, whom thyjade’s tricks have delivered bodily to the tormen¬tors, to be sport for these uncircumcised sons of7Dagon.’ And now the cell door opened, whena savage figure entered, carrying a huge parcelof clanking fetters, with a collar of Iron, whichhe put round the neck of poor Pedrosa, tellinghim, with a truly diabolical grin, whilst he wasrivetting it on, ‘ that it was a proper cravat forthe throat of a blasphemer.’—'Jesus Maria!’quoth Pedrosa., < is all this fallen upon me, foronly cudgelling a restive mule ?’ ‘ Aye,’ cried1 the demon, ‘ and this is only a taste ct what isto come,’ at the same time, slipping his pincersfrom the screw he was forcing to the head, hecaught a piece of flesh in the forceps, and wrench¬ed it out of his cheek, laughing at poor Nmolas,whilst he roared aloud with the pain, telling himit was a just reward for the torture he had puthim to a while ago, when he tugged at a toothtill he broke it in his jaw,’ ‘ Ah. for the loveof heaven,’ cried Pedrosa, ‘have more pity onme; for the sake of Saint Nicolas de Toientino,my holy pa'^on, be not ?o imme.eifu! to a poorbarber-surgeon; and I will shave your worship’sbeard for nothing as long as 1 have life.’ One ofthe messengers of the auditory now came in; andbade the fellow strike clF the prisoner's fetters,far that the holy fathers were in council, and de¬manded him for examination. ‘ This is some-i thing extraordinary,’ quoth the tormentor, * Ii should not have expected it this twelvemonth tocome.’ Pedrosa’s fetters were struck off; somebrandy was applied to staunch the bleeding of hischeek; his hands and face were washed, and ashort jacket of coarse ticking thrown over him ;and the messenger, with an assistant, taking him8each under an arm, led him into a spacious chain- •her, where at the head of a long table sat his ex- •cellency the Inquisitor-general with six of his as- •sessors, three on each side of the chair of state: :the alguaxU-mayor, a secretary, and two notaries, ,with other officers of the holy council, were at- >tending in their places.The prisoner was placed behind a bar at the !foot of the table, between the messengers whobrought him in; and having made his obeisanceto the awful presence, in the most supplicatingmanner, he was called upon, according to theusual form of questions, by one of the juniorjudges, to declare his name, parentage, profes¬sion, age, place of abode, anGt to answer variousinterrogatories, of the like trilling nature : his Ex¬cellency the Inquisidor-geneval now opened hisreverend lips, and in a solemn tone of voice, thatpenetrated to the heart of the poor tremblingprisoner, interrogated him as follows :Nicolas Pedrosa, we have listened to the ac¬count you give of yourself, your business and con¬nections; now tell us for what offence or offen¬ces, you are here standing a prisioner before us;examine your own heart, and speak the truthfrom your jpnscience without prevarication ordisguise.Mav it please your excellency, replied Pedro¬sa, with all due submission to your holiness andthis reverend assembly, my most equitable judges,I conceive I stand here before you for no worseii crime than that of cudgelling a refractory mule,an animal so restive in its nature, (under correc¬tion of your holiness be it spoken,) that although9I were blessed with the forbearance of holy Job,!(for like him too I am married, and my patiencejhath been exercised by a wife,) yet could I noti forbear to smite my beast for her obctinacr, andI the rather because I was summoned in the wayI of my profession, as I have already made known! to your most merciful ears, upon a certi'n cry-: mg occasion, which would not admit of a mo¬ment’s delay.Recollect yourself, Nicolas, said his Excellen-: cy the Inquisidor-general; was there nothing else| you did, save smiting your beast fI take Saint Nicolas de Tolentino to witness,i replied he, that I knbw of no other crime, lori which I can be responsible at this righteous tri-: bunal, save smiting my unruly bejist. Take no-I tice, brethren, exclaimed the Inquisidor, this un~I holy wretch holds trampling over friars to be noi crime.Pardon me, holy father, replied Nicolas, l holdit for the worst of crimes, and therefore willinglysurrender my refractory mule to be dealt with asyou see fit; and if you impale her alive, it wiilbe no more than she deserves.Your wits are too nimble, Nicolas, cried thejudge; have a care they do not run away withyour discretion; recollect the b’.,sphemies youuttered in the hearing of those pious people.I humbly pray your Excellency, answered theprisoner, to recollect that anger is a short mad¬ness, and I hope allowances will be made byyour holy council for words spoke in hast to arebellious mule: the prophet Balaam was thrownwff his guard by a simple ass, and what is an ass10somparerl to a mule ? If your Excellency hadseen the lovely creature that was screaming i:iagony till I came to her relief, and how fine aHoy I ushered into the world, which would havebeen lost but for my assistance, I am sure I shouldnot he condemned for a few hasty words spokenin passiop.Sitrah ! erred one of the puisny judges, respecttlie decency of the court. Produce the contentsof this fellow’s pockets before the court, said thepresjde-nt; lay them on the table.Monster, resumed the aforesaid puisny judge,taking up the forceps, what is the use of thisdiabolical machine? Please your reverence, re¬plied Pedrosa, ‘ aptum est art extrahendos feeius.'—Unnatural wretch, again exclaimed the judge,you have murdered the mother.The mother of God forbid ! exclaimed Pedro¬sa. I believe I have a proof in my pocket thatwill acquit me of that charge; and so saying, hetendered the letter we have before made mention !of. The secretary took it, and by command ofthe court read as follows:—“ Se?iior Don Manuel de Herrera,“ When this letter, which I send by NicolasPedrosa, shall reach your hands, you will knewthat I am safely delivered of a lovely boy, altera dangerous labour, in consideration of which Ipray you to pay to the said Nicolas Pedrosa thesum of twenty gold pistoles, which sum his Ex¬cellency—.”Hold, cried the Inquisitor-general, startinghastily from his seat, and snatching away the let¬ter, there is more in this than meets the eye:11ibrcak up the court; I must take an exa«unaiidA' of this prisoner in private.As soon as the room was cleared, the Inquisi-i tor-general, beckoning to the prisoner to followi him, retired into a private closet, where, throw-: ing himself carelessly into an arm chair, he turn.: ed a gracious countenance upon thf poor affright-: ed accoucheur, and bidding him sit down uponi a low stool by his side, thus accosted him:—I Fake heart, Senior Pedrosa, your imprisonmenti is not likely to be very tedious, for I have a cona-I mission you must execute without loss of time:I you have too much consideration for yourself to: betray a trust, the violation of which must in-i volve you in inevitable ruin, and can in no degreei attaint my character, which is far enough be-i yond the reach of malice ; be attentive, therefore,to my orders; execute them punctually, and keep: my secret as you tender your own life : dost thoui know the name and condition of the lady whomthou hast delivered ? Nicolas assured him heI did not, and his Excellency proceeded as follows ;I Then I tell thee, Nicolas, it is the illustriousDonna Leonora de Casafonda; her husband isI the president of Quito, and daily expected withthe next arrivals from the South Seas: now,! though measures have been taken for detainingi him at the port, wherever he shall land, till he shallreceive further orders, yet you must be sensibleDonna Leonora's situation is somewhat delicate:lit will be your business to take the speediest(measure for her recovery; but as it seems she(has had a dangerous and painful labour, this maybe a work of more time than could be wished,12Jess spme metlicincs more efficacious than com¬mon a^e administered; rrt thou acquainted withsmy ludb, friend Nicolas f-—So pltase your Ex-ceiJtncy, qupth Nicolas, my processes have beentolerably successful; I have bandages and cata¬plasms, with oils and conserves, that I have nocause to complain of; they will restore nature toits proper state in »U decent time. — Thou talkestlike a fOo), friend Nicolas, interrupting him, saidthe Inquisitor ? What teilest thou me of thyswathings and swaddlings ? quick work must bewrought by quick medicine : hast thou none suchin thy botica ? I’ll answer for it thou hast not;therefore, look you, sirrah, here is a little vialcompounded by a famous chemist; see that youmix it in the next apocem you administer toDonna Leonora; it is the most capital sedativein nature; give her the whole of it, and let herhusband return when he will, depend upon it hewill make no discoveries from her.—Humph !quoth Nicolas within himself, well said Inquisi-dor ! He took the vial with all possible respect,and wrs not wanting in professions of the mostinviolable fidelity and secrecy.—No more words>friend Nicolas, quoth the Inquisidcr, upon thatscore, I do not believe thee one jot the more forall thy promises, my dependence is upon thyfears and not thy faith; I fancy thou hast seenenough of this place not to be widing to returnto it once for all ! Having so said, he rang abell, and ordered Nicolas to be forthwith liber¬ated, bidding the messenger return his clothesinstantly to him with all that belonged to him,and having slipt a purse into his hand we.l filledwith doubloon*, he bade him begose about his.msiness, and not see his face again till he hadexecuted his demands.Nicolas bolted out of the porch without takingeave of the altar, ami never checked his speedill he found himself fauly housed- under shelter>f his own beloved brass basin.—Aha! quoth'Jicolas, my lord Inquisidor, [ see the king istot likely to gain a subject more by your intrigues :i pretty job you have set me about; and so,ahen 1 have put the poor lady to rest with yourdamned sedative, my tongue must be stopt nextp prevent its blabbing: but I’ll shew you I wasnot born in Andalusia for nothing. Nicolas nowppened a secret drawer, and took out a fewnieces of money, which, in fact, was his wholejitock rf cash in the world; he loaded and primedais pi tc!s, and carefully lodged them in the hou-ters of his saddle! he buckled to his side hisrusty spada, and hastened to caparison his mule.Ah, thou imp of the old one, quoth he, as hefiltered the stable, art not ashamed to look men the face ? But come, hussy, thou owest me]i good turn, methinks ; stand by me this once,(uid be friends for ever! thou art in good case,nnd if thou wilt put thy best foot foremost, likeJ» faithful beast, thou shalt not want for barleybn the way. The bargain was soon struck be¬tween Nicolas and his mule, he mounted her inthe happy moment, and pointing his course to¬ward the bridge of Toledo, which proudly strideswith half a dozen lofty arches over a streamucarce three feet wide, he found himself as com-uletely in a desart in half a mile’s riding, as if ha14had been dropt in the centre of Arabia Petrs i. ifAs Nicolas’s journey was not a tour ot curiosity, ;he did not amuse himself with a peep at Toledo,or Talavera, or eren Merida, by the way: for *ithe same reason he took a circumbendibus round ^the frontier town of Badajoz ; and crossing a *little brook, refreshed his mule with the last ffdraught of Spanish water, and instantly congra¬tulated himself upon entering the territory of [?Portugal. Brava! quoth he, patting the neckof his mule, thou shalt have a supper this nightof the best sive-meat that Estramadura can fur- J>nish: we are now in a country where the scat¬tered flock of Israel fold thick and fare well. He j,now began to chaunt the Song of Solomon, and 'gently ambled on in the joy of his heart.When Nicolas at length reached the city of ‘iiisbon, he hugged himself in his good fortune; 1stiil he recollected that the Inquisition had longarms, and he was yet in a place of no perfect 'security. Our adventurer had in early life acted 1as assistant-surgeon in a Spanish frigate bound toBuenos Ayres, and being captured by a British 'man of war and carried into Jamaica, had very jquietly passed some years in that place as jour- 1neyman apothecary, in which time he had ac • 1quired a tolerable acquaintance with the English |language. No sooner then did he discover the IBritish ensign flying on the poop of an English [frigate then lying in the Tagus, than he eagerly 1caught the opportunity of paying a visit to the Jsurgeon; and finding he was in want of a mate,offered himself, and was entered in that capacity 1for a cruize agrinst the French and Spaniards,15j’ifh whom Great Britain -w'as then at war. In1)15 secure asylum Nicolas enjoyed the first hap-y moments he had experienced for a long timelast, and being a lively good-humoured little fel-:>w, and one that touched the guitar and sungfiquidillas with a tolerable grace, he soon re-lommsnded himself to bis ship mates, and grewi favour with every body on board, from thepptain to the cook’s mate.When they were out upon their cruize, hover-;rg on the Spanish coast, it occurred to Nicolas,rat the Inquisitor-general at Madrid had told:im of the expected arrival of the president ofluito, and having imparted this to one of thekutenants, he reported it to the captain; andp the intelligence seemed of importance, hebailed himself of it, by bawling into the trackf the homeward-bound gaMecns, and great waslie joy, when at the break of the morning the■an at the mast-head announced a square-riggedessel in view. The ardour of a chase now set1 hands at work ; and a few hours brought thempar enough to discern that she was a Spanishligate, and seemingly from a long voyage : little:?dro?a, as alert as the rest, stript himself fors work, and repaired to his post in the cock-,t, whilst the thunder of the guns reeled inces-mtly over his head ; three cheers from the wholefew at length announced the moment of victory,lid a few more minutes ascertained the goodi‘ws, that the prize was a frigate richly ladenlorn the South Seas, with the governor of Quitolid his suite on board.Pedrosa was now called upon deck, and tent•h board the prize as interpreter to the first iieu- -tenant, who was to take possession of her.—He ifound every thing in confusion, a deck covered 1with the slain, and the whole crew in consterna- fttion at an event they were in no degree prepared 1for, not having received any intimation of a war. ,He found the officers in general, and the pasSen- ■gets without exception, under the most horrid 1impressions of the English, expecting to be but- ■chered without mercy. Don Manuel de Casa- »fond a, the governor, whose countenance bespokea constitution far gone ir. a decline, had thrownhimself on a sofa, in the last state of despair, andgive* way to an effusion of tears : when the lieu¬tenant entered the cabin, he rose trembling fromhis couch, and with the most supplicating actionpresented to him his sword, and with it a casketwhich he carried in his other hand: as he ten¬dered these spoils to his conqueror, whetherthrough his weakness, or of his own will, hemade a motion of bending his knee: the gener¬ous Briton, shocked ttt the unmanly overture,caught him suddenly with both hands, and turn¬ing to Pedrosa, said aloud,—Convince this gen¬tleman he is fallen into the hands of an honour¬able enemy.—Is it possible ! cried Don Manuel,and lifting up his streaming eyes to the counte¬nance of the British officer, saw humanity, valour,and generous pity, so strongly characterized in hisyouthful features, that the conviction was irre¬sistible. Will he not accept my sword ? criedthe Spaniard. He desires yoU to wear it, till hehas the honour of presenting you to hss captain.Ah ! then he has a captain, exclaimed Don Ma*17ue!f 3us sucerior will be of another way of(linking; tell him tL*s casket contains my jew-.Is ; they are valuable; let him present them z». lawful prize, which will enrich the captor; hisuperior %ill not hesitate to take them from me.—If they are your Excellency’s private property,epiied Pedrosa, I am ordered to assure you, thatf your ship were loaded with jewels, no British.officer in the service of his king will take themit your hands : the ship and effects of his Catho-ic Majesty are the only prize of the captors; thelerscnals of the passengers are inviolate —Gen-.•rous nation ! exclaimed Don Manuel, howgreatly have I wronged thee !—The boats of tkeBritish frigate now came alongside, and part ofhe crew were shifted out of the prize, takingtheir clothes and trunks along with them, inwhich they were very cordially assisted by theirconquerors. The barge soon after came aboardwith an cfncer in the stern-sheets, and the crew‘in their white shirts and velvet caps, to escort th®governor and the ship’s captain on board the fri¬gate, which lay with her sails to the mast, await¬ing their arrival: the accormnodation-ladder wasslung over the side, and manned for the prison¬ers, who were received on the gang-way by thesecond lieutenant, whilst perfect silence and thestrictest discipline reigned in the ship, where allwere under the decks, and no inquisitive curiouseyes were suffered to wound the feelings of theconquered even with a glance. In the door ofhis cabin stood the captain, who received them•with that modest complaisance, which does notrevolt the unfortunate by an overstrained polite-18ness: he was a man of hi^h birth and elesan!manners, with a heart as benevolent as it warbravo: such an address, set off with a persontfinely formed and perfectly engaging, could not'fail to impress the prisoners with the most fav-lcurable ideas ; and as Don Manuel spoke French,fluently, he could converse with the British cap-ttain without the hglp of an interpreter: as helexpressed an impatient desire of being admitted!to his parole, that he might revisit his friends'and connections, from whom he had been longseparated, be was overjoyed to hear that theEnglish ship would carry her prize into Lisbon *,and that he would there be set on shore, and per¬mitted to make the best of his way from thenceto Madrid. He talked of his wife with all theardour of the most impassioned lover, and apo.logized for his tears, by imputing them to the iagony of his mind and infirmity of his health, ,under the dread of being longer separated from ion object so dear to his heart, and on whom he idcwted with the fondest affection. The gener¬ous captain indulged him in these conversations, ,and being a husband himself, knew how to al- ■low tor all the tenderness of his sensations. Ah, ,Sir, etied Don Manuel, would to heaven it were jin my power to have the honour of presentingmy beloved Leonora to you on our landing atLisbon.—Perhaps, added he, turning to Pedrosa,who at that moment entered the cabin, this gen- ttleman, whom I take to be a Spaniard, may haveheard the name of Donna Leonora de Casafonda ;if he has been at Madrid, it is possible he maykzye seen her $ should that be the case, he can19(testify to her external charms •, I alone can wit-mess to the exquisite perfections of her mind.—Senior Don Manuel, replied Pedrosa, I have seenDonna Leonora, and your Excellency is warrant¬ed in all you can say in her praise; she is of in¬comparable beauty. These words threw the ux¬orious Spaniard into raptures ; his eyes sparkledwith delight; the blood rushed into his emaciatedcheeks, and every feature glowed with unutter¬able joy : he pressed Pedrosa with a variety ofrapid inquiries, all which he evaded by pleadingjignorance, saying that he had only a casual glance(of hex-, as she passed along the Prado. The em-ibarrassment, however, which accompanied these.answers, did not escape the English captain, who,! shortly after, drawing Pedrosa aside into the sur¬geon’s abut, was by him made acquainted withIthe melancholy situation of that unfortunate lady,and every particular of the story as before related*may, the very vial was produced, with its con-| tents, as put into the hands of Pedrosa by theInquisitor.Can there be such villainy in man ? cried thed British captain, when Pedrosa had concluded hisSi detail: alas! my heart bleeds for this unhappyjihusband; assuredly, that monster has destroyed!.Leonora; as for thee, Pedrosa, whilst the Brit-lish flag flies over thy head, neither Spain, nor) Portugal, nor inquisitors, nor devils, shall annoydthee under its protection; but if thou ever ven-nturest over the side of this ship, and rashly set-(itest thy foot upon Catholic soil, when we arrive: at Lisbon, thou art a lost man.—I were worseiithan a madman, replied Nicolas, should 1 at-/20tempt it.—Keep close in this asylum, then, re*Hsumed the captain, and fear nothing : had it beeri*our fate to have been captured by the Spaniard uwhat would have become of thee.—In the v/ors1)!of extremities, replied Nicolas, I should havttfapplied to the inquisitor’s vial; but I confess ifjhad no fears of that sort; a ship so commanded:and so manned is in little danger of being car-i;ried into a Spanish port.—1 hope nor, said thei:captain, and I promise thee, thou shalt take thjrchance in her as long as she is afloat under my..command : and if we Iiv£ to conduct her to Eng‘Jjland, thou shalt have thy proper share of prize-t'money, which, if the galleon breaks up accord:ing to her entries, will be something towards!enabling thee to shift, and if thou art as diligent:in thy calling, as I am persuaded thou wilt be,:whilst I live, thou shalt never want a seaman’s!friend.—At these cheering words, little Nicolastthrew himself at the feet of his generous preserv-ter, and, with streaming eyes, poured out hisithanks from a heart animated with joy and gra-rtitude.—The captain raising him by the hand^forbade him, as he prized his friendship, ever tfiiaddress him in that posture any more : thank me*if you will, added he, but thank me as one mansshould another: let no knee bend in this shipbut in adoration of God.—But now, continued*he, let us turn our thoughts to the situation ohour unhappy Casafonda: we are now drawinglnear Lisbon, where he will look to be liberated)on his parole. By no means let him venture in*tto Spain, said Pedrosa: I am well assured there:are orders to arrest him in every port, or frofttien21'»wn, where he may present himself. I can well;;lieve it, replied the captain; his piteous case(•ill require further deliberation ; in the meanme, let nothing transpire on your part; and)eep yourself out of his sight as carefully as youjan.— This said, the captain left the cabin, andloth parties repaired to their several occupations.As soon as the frigate, and her prize, castmchor in the Tagus. Don Manuel de CasafondaInpatiently reminded our captain of his promisedparole. The painful moment was now come»Irhen an explanation of some sort became un¬avoidable : the generous Englishman, with alountenance expressive of the tenderest pity, tookihe Spaniard’s hand in his, and seating him oni. couch beside him, ordered the ccntinel to keepihe cabin private, and delivered himself as fol¬lows :—Senior Don Manuel, I must now impart toI'ou an anxiety which l labour under on your ac¬count; 1 haye strong reasons to suspect you have1'iiemies in your own country, who are upon theivatch to arrest you on your landing; when Inave told you this, I expect you will repose suchirust in my honour, and the sincerity of my re¬gard for you, as rot to demand a further expla¬nation of the particulars on which my inlelligenees founded.— Heaven and earth ! cried the as¬tonished Spaniard, who can be those enemies Ihave to fear, and what can 1 have done to de¬serve them ! So far I will open myself to you,answered the captain, as to point out the princi-p>! to you, the Inquisitor-general The bestfriend 1 have in Spain, exclaimed the governor,22shy sworn protector, th* patron of my fortunehe my enemy ! impossible. Well, Sir, replied**the captain, if my advice do not meet belief, Emust so far exert my authority for your sake, a^ito make this ship your prison, till I have waited^on our minister at Lisbon, and made the eaqui-i?ties necessary for your safety; suspend your.judgment upon the seeming harshness of thia^.,measure till I return to you again; and, at the*same time, rising from his seat, he gave ordersjifor the barge ; after leaving strict injunctions witty;the first lieutentant not to allow of the governor's^quitting the frigate, he put off for the shore. ,The emissaries of the inqisition having at last jtraced Pedrosa, our captain had no sooner turn-ijed into the porch of the hotel of Buenos Ayres, ithan he was accosted by a messenger of state^;with a requisition for the surrender of Pedrosa. !As soon as this requisition was explained to ourjiworthy captain, lie dispatched the midshipman,to m?ke the best of his .vay b’.ck to the frigate,and deliver a letter to the lieutenant; then turn-ting to the messenger, he said, l hat Spaniard isnow borne on u.y books, and before you shalltake him out of the service of my king you mustsink his ship.

RETURNS.The day returns, my bosom burns,The blissful day we twa did meet}Tho’ winter wild in tempest toil’d,Ne’er summer sun was hauf sae sweet.Thaa a’ the pride that loads the tide,And crosses o’er the sultry line,4Than kingly robes, than crowns and globes,Heav’n gave me more it made tiiee mine.While day and night can bring delight,Or nature aaght of pleasure give jWhile joy above my mind can move,]For thee and thee alone I live.When that grim foe of life below,Comes in between to make us part,The iron hand that breaks our band,It breaks my bliss—it breaks my heart.THE SAILOR BOV.To Davy Jones old dad was gone,And mother likewise dead.When little I was left alone,To labour for my bread.No matter, I ne'er pip'd my eye.Thof care attach'd me sore,But soon become a sailor boy,And left all care on shore.All danger did I smiling scortfjAnd swigg'd the flowing can,And prov'd myself from stem to stern,A sailor and a man.t6To Indies, east and west, I sail'd,The line I cross'd o'er and o'er,Ere on my native beach I hail'd,My Pretty Poll on shore.We jigg'd it at a merry dance,And both dislik'd to part,My timbers stout may start by chance,But English oak my heart.Then let but lortune cheerly smile.And hand me j*£d galore,Why, all the sum of all my toilIs pretty Poll on shore.HILLS OF GALLOWA.Amang the birks sae blythe and gay,I met my Julia hameward gaun jThe linties chantit on the spray,The lammies lowpit on the lawn ;On ilka swaird the hay was mawn,The braes wi* gowans buskit braw ;And gloamin’s plaid o' grey was thrawn,Out o’er the hills of Gallowe..Wi’ music wild the woodlands rang,And fragrance winged alang the lee,6When down we sat, the flowers amang,Upon the banks of stately Dee.My Julia’s arms encircled me ;Then sweetly slade the hears awa,Till dawnin’ cost a glimmerin’ ee,"4 Upon the hills o’ Gallowa.It is nae owsen, sheep and kye,It is nae gowd it is nae gear.This lifted ee wad hae quoth I,The warld’s drumlie gloom to chear ;But gie to me my Julia dear,Ye pow’rs wlia rule this earthen baAnd O sae blythe thro’ life I'll steer,Amang the hills o’ Gallowa.When gloamin’ daunders up the hill,And our gudeman ca’s hame the cows jWi’ her I’ll trace the mossy rill,That thro’ the rashes dimpled rows $Or tint amang the scroggy knowes,My birken pipe I’ll sweetly blaw.And sing the streams, the straths," the howes,The hills and dales o' Gallowa.And when auld Scotland’s heathy hills,Her rmal nymphs and jovial swains,Her flowery wilds and wimpling rills,Awake nae mair my cantie streams ;7Where friendship dwells and freedom reigns,Where heather blooms and moor-cocks craw,O dig my grave, and lay my bones,Araang the hills o' Gallowa.DH NANNY WILT THOU FLY WITH ML.Oh Nanny, wilt thou flv with me,nor sigh to leave the charming town,Can silent glens have charms for thee,the lowly cote and russet gown.No longer d<est in silken sheen,no longer deck’d with jewels rare ?Say, canstjtboa quit the busy scene,where thou wert fairest of the fair.Where thou art fairest, where thou art fairestwhere thou wert fairest of the fair.Oh Nanny when Ihou’rt far awa,do thou not cast a wish behind ?Say. canst thou, face the flaky snaw,nor shrink" before the warping wind,O can that saft and gentlest mien,severest hardships learn to bear.Nor, sad regret each courtly scene,where thou wert fairest of the fair.i© Nanny can'st thou love so true,thro' perils keen vvi‘ me to gae,©r when thy swain mishap shall rue,to share wi‘ him the pangs o‘ wae.And when invading pains befal,wilt thou assume the nurse's care jNor wishful, those gay scenes recal,where thou wert fairest of the fair.And when, at last, thy love shall die,wilt thou receive his parting breath,Wilt thou repress each struggling sigh,and cheer with smiles the bed of death.And wilt thou o or his much lov d clay,strew flowers, and drop the the tender tear,Nor then regret those scenes so gay,where thou wert fairest of the fair.THE SAILOR'S RETURN.Behold, from many a hostile shore,And all the dangers of the man,Where billowr mount, and tempests rear,Your faithful Tom returns $Returns, and with him brings a heart,That ne'er from Sally will depart.After long toils and troubles past>How sweet to tread our native soil',With conquest to return at last.And deck our sweet hearts with the spoilNo one to beauty should pretend,Rut such as dare it's rights defend.

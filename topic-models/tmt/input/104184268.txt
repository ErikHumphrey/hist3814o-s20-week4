Railing her, therefore,. ifrom the ground, he led her to a fopha, and; ifeating himfelf by her, defired her, inaman«ner which encouraged her to repofe a confi-; dence in him, to begin her narrative. ><i My ftory, Sir, will be foon told ; andviif you have as much humanity as ybu' appear to have, you will, inftead of wilh-i ling to make me the unhappieft of my fex,: Teftore me to my afihded parrents, who areno doubt, at this moment half diftradled•on my account. My father and mother,•Sir, are the bell people in the world, and: formerly lived in affluence; but my father,/ having met with misfortunes, thought itnprudent to retire into the cheapeft part of. 'England he could hear of; as he was notfable to live in his ufual ftile of life in Lon-odon, and had too much pride to leffen his^appearance in it. * ' ij“ As my father had all the reafon in the:r, world to believe that he Ihould have it ine his power to give me a handfome fortune-—I am his only child—he ipared no expenceiin my education : I was indeed educatednin fuch a manner that I might not difgracea coronet, if it (hould fall to my lot. Toiifee me well married, in the molt, falhion-( 6 )able fenfe of the word, was his continuawifh ; and he was juft on the point of feeing!»ie fo married, when the failure of a merchant, in whofe hands a conhderable partiof his property was lodged, had fuch an|cffcfl on the gentleman who paid his adoreffes to me, that he immediately difcover-1rd his mercenary difpofition, by meanljwithdrawing them. This additional difappotntment lowered my father’s fpirits, and'toured his temper to fuch a degree, that he:determined to bury himfelf in oblcurity, &to have as few connexions with the world asipoffible.“ At the beginning of laft fummer wetook leave of London, and w«ere in one dayconveyed to our retirement in a little vil¬lage about fifty miles from hence ; for myfather, eager to fly from a place in whichlie had received fuch a blow to his pride, iwas determined to travel with the utmoftexpedition. A more lonely fpbt is nor,perhaps, to be found in England; but asmy father was Tick of fociety, the lonelinefsof if was rather agreeable to him : it washowever, far otherwife to my mother andto me.tc When we had been in this retreat afew months, an elderly lady took lodgingsat a farm-houfe near us, who appearing ex¬tremely like a gentlewoman, and like a per-fon who had been reduced from affluent toTpf ''| (7/)' (narrow chxumftances, feemcd to be a pro-siper neighbour for ks ; and, indeed, her.i comprny was very acceptable. My mother11 liked her as well as 1 did ; and even my. 'ather was To much entertained with heri :onverfation, that he encouraged an iati-nacy.*c When we came intimate,Mrs Ditton[that w’as her name) acq.uaimed us with herliftory ; and by fo doing placed herfelf mjm amiable, but in a pitiable light: far ad-,|f;anced as (he was in life, (he had a greatideal of vivacity, and the politenefs of herloehaviour fufficiently confirmed all that IheBft'ad communicated relating to the fpherc’ n which fhe had figured.*| “In about fix weeks after the commence-• i^nent of our acquaintance, Mrs Dittondold my mother, that if Ihe would trulVmenvhh her, fbe fliould be exceedingly gladi l‘f my company to London, as the was go*t|jng thither on particular bufmefs; adding,hat fire fhould return to the farm (fo fheailed her little dwelling), when her buft-efs was finifhed.“ My mother, having a high fopinion ofer new friend’s character from the proprie-j/ of her carriage, was not in the leaft un-illing to put me under her prote&ion ; &:’hy father having the fame fcntjmentsin herojjtvour, as chearlully exprefied hisj con-aint.( 5 )'r‘ When we came to town, Mrs Dittorbrought me to this houfe, telling me thatthe lady who hept it was her very goofriend, and would treat me with the greateftregard on her account.

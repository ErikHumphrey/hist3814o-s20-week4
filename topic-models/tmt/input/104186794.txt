The hattle of Prestonpam;To which is added,WALY, WALY.1S2*,THE BATTLE OF PRESTONPAN3.The Chevalier being void of fear,did march up Brialie brae man ; ' vAnd through Tranent e'er he did stent,as fast ai he could gae man,While general Cope did taunt and mock,wi' mony a loud huaza man ;But e'er next morn proclaim'd the coek,we heard anither craw man.The brave Lochiel as I heard tell,led Camerons on in clouds man,The morning fair did clear the air,they loosed with devluh thuds man.Down guns they threw and swords they drew,and soon did chace them aff man ;On Seaton crafis they built their chafts,and gart them rin like daft man.The blufF dragoons swore blood and 'oons,thej'J make the rebels run naan ;A*d yet they flee when them they see,and wiaca fire a gun man.3Tkey turn'd their back, the foot they brake,such terror seised them a’ man,Some wet their cheeks some fyl'd their breeks,and some for fear did fa' man.The volunteers prick’d up their ears,and vow but they were crouse man:But when the bairns they saw’t turn to earn'st,they were not worth a louse man.Maist feck gaed hame, O fy for shame,they'd better staid awa man ;Then wi' eockade to make paradeand do nae good at a' man,Honteath the great, when hersel’ shot,un'warea did ding him o’er man.Yet wad nae stand to bear a hand,but aff did dee like scour man ;O'er Soutra-hill e'er he stood still,before he tasted meat man;Troth be may brag of his sweet nag,that bare him alf sae sleet man.And Seaton keen to clear the sen,of rebels far in wrang man ;Did never strive wi' pistols five,but gallop’d with the thrang man:4He turned his back and in a crack,was cleanly cut of sight mas ;4nd though it best, it vas nae jest,wi Highlanders to fight man.'Mong a‘ the gang nane bade the bang,but twa aud ane was tane man;For Campbell rade? but Morie staid,and sair he paid the kain man.Fell skelps he got was waut than shot,frae the sharp-edged claymore man,Fxae mcny a spout came running outhis reeking red hot gore man.Bat Gard'ner brave did still behave*like to a hero bright man.His courage true like him were few,that still despised flight man :For king aad laws and country's cause,in honour's bed he lay man,His life but not his courage fled,while he bad breath to draw man.And Major Boyle that woithy soul,was brought down to the ground man,IIi$ horse beiag shot it was his lot,for to get many a wound man !5Lieutenant Smith of Irish birth,’frac whom he call'd for ais manBeiog full of dread lap o'er his head,aaa would not be gainsaid maa.He made such haste, sae spurr'd his beast‘twas little there he saw, man;To Berwick radc, and falsely said,the Scots are rebels a1 man:But let that end for well 'tis kend,his use and wont to lie man ;The league is nought, he never sought,when he ha I room to flee man.But gallant Rodger, like a roJger,stood and bravely fought man:I‘vn wae to tell at lau he #V1I.but mae down wr lam brought man :At point of death wi‘ bis last breath,(some stindiog round la ring man)On's back lying flu he waved his hat,and cried God save the king man.Some Highland rogues like hungry dogs,neglecting to pursue maa,About they fac’d and in great hasteupon the booty flew man.6Ani they as gain, for ill their piinare deck'd wi‘ spoils o< war man;Fu‘ bauld can tell how her nainselSwas ne'er sae pra‘ pefore mm.At the thorn tree, which you may see,bewest the Meadow- mill man,1 here mony slain lav on the plain,the clans pursuing still man,Sic unco' backs and deadly whaks,I never saw the like man,Lost hands and heads eoit them their deeds,that fell at Prestcn-Dyke man.That afternoon when a' was done,I gaed to see the fray man;But I had wist what after past,I‘d better staid »«>» >=n«n,On Seaton sands* wi’ nimble hands*they pick'd my pockets bare man jBat I wish ne'er to prie sic fear,for a‘ the sum and mair man.WALY, WALY,O WALY, waly up yon bankAnd waly, waly, down yon brae,?And waly by yon river side,Where I and my love wont to gae,0 waly, waly, love i* bonnie,A little while when it is new:But when its auli it waxes cauld.And wears awa’ like morning dew.1 leant my back unto an aik,I thought it wa* a trmty tree;But first he bow'd, and then it brake,And sae did my fause love to me.When cockle-shells turn silver bells,And mussels grow on ev'ry tree,When frost and gnaw shall warm us a',Then shall my love prove true by me*Now Arthur’s seat shall be my bed,The sheets shall ee’er be fyl’d by me ;St Anthon’s well shall be my drink,Since my fause love's forsaken me.0 Mai f mas wind when wilt thou blaw,And shike the green leaves aff the treeO gsatle Death, when wilt thou come,And tak a life that wearies me.Ii‘s not the frost that freezes fell,Nor bl&wivg snaw's inclemency;3It's not the cauld that makes me cry,But my love's heart grown cauld to me.When wo c*me in by Glasgow town.We were a comely sight to see;My love was clad in velvet black,And I myself in cramasie.But had I wist before I kist,That love had been sae ill to win,I’d lock'd my heart in a case of gold,And pin'd it with a silver pin,Gh ! oh! if my young babe were born,And set upon the rune s knee;And I mysel were dead and ganciFor maid again 111 never be.FINIS.

Ye gods ! she was a virgin fair,none could her charms excel:No rose on sharon's vale could e'er,compare with bonny BellFor her full long did Strephon whine,for her he rack'd his breast,But no fond flatterer could engage,this Helen of the west.Ignaro next the fair address'd,he too a passion feign'd ;6Plutus in vain did urge his suit,but both the maid disdain'd.Ye gods, &c.At last grave Damon made his suit,she listen'd to his taleHe pled a genuine virtuous love,and virtu 1 did prevail,The choice approv'd : to lend his aid,Thaliusd d not fail ;Each vale resounded with the praise,of Damon and his Bell.ESK MILL.Tune—“ Banks of the Devon.”The rnoon o'er the waves of the North throws herg'or.Y.And brightens the snow wreaths on proud Pentlandhigh ,Whilst cold under arms, I view, leafless and hoary,The dark wood that answers the sentinel's cry.But what are my sufferings, though cold, w'et, andweary,And round me the rude blasts of ihsult blaw shrillTo tiieirs who re confin'd in the dungeon so dreary,And wail life away in the gloom of Esk Mill.70h Esk ! gentle Esk ! as thou flaw through the val-ley’ -i, VNo soft sounds of love now pass o'er thy wave's,At night the tatoo, and at morn the rivally.Are mixed with sighs from the iron grated grave.Industry has fled from thy scenes row distressing,The Bard shuns thy banks, who, when evening wasstill.Us'd so pensive to wander the muse fond caressingNow sigh when he thinks on the woes of Esfe Mill.In fancy I wander where nations uniting,Display their proud banners o'er hill and o'er daleI hear the loud roar of the armies still fightingI see of the battle the mournful detail.^ I fO i •Poor remnant of armies how strongly escorted,I see their sad march while my heart's blood runschill, ’* ‘ ‘ •*Far, farfrom their kindred with grief broken-heart¬edSlow pass the sad hours—woeful hours in EskMill.Ye troublers ofNations how poor is your glory,The pages ot history will blush with your crimes.Your deeds will seem darker your features moregory,When man shuddering views you, in all futuretimes.i; < ...But what is the gay round of Royalty shining.bWhen sleep fly your couch as the wini o'er thehill ;More happy the swain in cold poverty piningMore happy the prisoner in gloomy Es.'v Mill.THE COBLliR'S HAPPINESS,Let matters of state,Disquiet the great,The Cobler has nought to perplex him;Has nought but his wifeTo ruffle his life.And.her he can stap, if she vex him.lie's out of the po»v'rOf Foitune, that whore.Since low as can be she has thrust him :From duns he's secure,For being so poor.There's none to be found that will trust him.'i-iNF.

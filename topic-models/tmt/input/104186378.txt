a’Yere come aff the house o’ HarletilhimYe soon weary o’ weel doing [ patYe’s get your brose out o’ the lee side o’ theYe shape shoon by your ain shachled feetY our tongue’s nae slanderYour tongue rins aye before your witYe watna whare a blessing may lightYe was never born at that time o’ the yearYoung folk may die but auld folk maun dieYoung ducks may be auld geeseYour meal’s a’ deaghYour head will never fit your father’s bonnetYour thrift’s as guid’s the profit of a yell henYour wame thinks your wizen’s cutted [forYour purse was steeked when that was paidYour gear will never o’ergang yeYour minny’s milk’s no out o’ your nose yet

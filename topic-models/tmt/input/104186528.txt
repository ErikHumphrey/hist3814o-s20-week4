I.T)r Fausius’s JYirthand Education; rvitan account of his falling from the Serflures.Doctor John Faustus was bornGermany. Hi's father was apoor labouring man, not able to bring up his sorbut he had a brother in the same comtry, who was a very rich man, but hanever a child, and took a great faneto his cousin, and he resolved to mal?a scholar of him ; and in order thereunto, put him to the Latin school, when \be took his learning extraordinary weLafterwards he put him to the universty to study divinity; but Fausticould in no wise fancy that employnient; wherefore he betook himself tit3the studying of that which his incli¬nation was most for, viz. necromancyand conjuration, and in a little timefewornonecould outstrip himinthe art:he also studied divinity, of which hewas made doctor; but within a shorttime fell into such deep fancies andcomtations that he resolved to throwthe scripttires from him, and betakehimself wholly to the studying of nec¬romancy and conjuration, charms andsoothsaying, witchcraft, and the like.CHAP. II.i How Dr Faustns conjured up the Devil,I making him appear at Ids house.Faustus, whose mind was to study con¬juration, which he followed night andday, he took tiie wings of an eagle andendeavoured to fly over the world, tosee and know all the secrets of heav¬en and earth. In a short time he at¬tained power to command the devil toappear before him when he pleased.One day as Dr Faustus was walking in4a wood, near to Wirtemberg infflGermany, having a friend with himljthat was desirous to know the doctor’s Jart, he desired him to let him see if hecould then and there bring IMephosto-philes before him ; all which the doctorimmediately did ; and the devil uponthe first call made such a noise in thewoodr as if heaven and earth wouldhave come together; then the devilmade such a roaring, as if the woodhad been full of wild beasts. The doc¬tor made a circle for the devil, thewhich circle the devil ran round, mak¬ing a noise as if ten thousand waggonshad been running upon paved stones.After this it thundered and lightenedas if the whole world had been on fire.Faustus and his friend, amazed at thisnoise, and the devil’s long tarrying,thought to leave the circle ; where¬upon, the devil made him such music,the like was never heard in the world ;this so ravished Faustus that he beganagain to conjure Mephostophiles in thename cf the prince of the devils, to ap¬pear in his own likeness; whereupon5n an instant, hung over his head anighty dragon. Faustus calls againfter his former manner, after which•here was a cry in the wood as if hell:ad been opened, and all the tormentediouls had been there ; Faustus, in thelean while, asking the devil manyuestions, and commanding him toihew many tricks.CHx\P. III.'low Mephostophiles came to Dr Faus-tus's house, and what happened between! them.*FaustuS commanded the spirit tomeet him at his. house by ten of thedock the next day. At the hour ap-Pointed he came into his chamber, ask¬ing Faustus what he would have ; Faus-us told him, it was his will and pleas¬ure to conjure him to be obedient tohim in all points of those articles, viz.First, That the spirit shall serve5him in all things he asked, from thatime till his death.GZecondh) Whatsoever he would ]have.he should bring him.Thirdly, Whatsoever he desired to jknow, he should tell him.The spirit answered him and said, hehad no such power of himself, until hehad acquainted his prince that ruledover him ; for, said he, we have rulersover us, that send us out, End commandus home, when they please ; and we canact no farther than our power is, whichwe receive fromX.ucifer, who you knowfor his pride was thrust out of heaven.But, saith the spirit, I am not to tellyou any more except you make your¬self over to us.Whereupon Faustus said, I will havemy request ; hut yet I willnot bedamn-ed with you. Then said the spirit,you must not, nor shall not have yourdesire, and yet thou art mine, and allthe world cannot save thee out of myhands. Then said Faustus, get theehence, and I conjure thee, that thoucome to me at night. The spirit then' 7vanished, Faustus then began to con¬sider how he might obtain his desire,and not to give his soul to the devil.And while Faustus was in these .de¬vilish cogitations, night drew on, andthis hellish spirit appeared to him,acquainting him that now he had or¬ders from his prince to be obedient tohim, and to do for him whatsoever hedesired, provided he would promise tobe his, and withal to acquaint him firstwhat be would have of him? Faustusreplied, that his desire was to becomea spirit, and that Mephostophiles shouldhe always at his command, that when¬soever he called for him, he shall ap¬pear invisible to all men, and that heshould appear in what shape he pleased.To which the spirit answered, that ailhis desires should be granted if hewould sign those articles, whereuponDr Faustus, withdrew and prickedhis wrist, receiving the blood in a smallSaucer, which cooled so fast, as it8it for-warned him of the hellish act hewas going to commit ; nevertheless ,he put it over embers to warm it, jand writ as followeth :I, John Faustus, approved doctor ofdivinity, with my own hand do acknow¬ledge and testily myself to become aservant to Lucifer, prince of Septentri- 'onal and Orient, and to him I freelyand voluntarily give both body andsoul; in consideration for the space oftwenty four years, if 1 be served in allthings I shall require, or which is rea¬sonable by him to be allowed : at the iexpiration of which, from the date ensu¬ing, I give to him all power to do withme at his pleasure ; to rule to fetchand carry me where he pleases bodyand soul: hereupon I defy God andChrist, and all the host of angels andgood spirits ; all living creatures thatbear his shape, or on whom his imageis imprinted ; and to thebetterstrength¬ening the validity of this covenant andfirm agreement between us, I have writit with my own blood, and subscribedl9ijmy name to'it, calling all the powersand infernal potentates to witness itlis my true intent and meaning.JOHN FJUSTUS.CHAP. IV.%What happened to Dr Faustus after thesigning of the Articles.When Faustus had made an end of hiswriting, he called Mephostophiles tohim, and delivered him the bond ;whereupon the spirit told him, that ifhe did not repent of what he had done,he should enjoy all the pleasure histhoughts could form, and that he wouldimmediately divert him. He caused akennel of hounds to run down a hartin the hall, and vanished; then a bulldanced before Faustus ; also there wasa lion and a bear which fell to fight¬ing before Faustus, and the lion de¬stroyed the bear ; after that came a dra¬gon and destroyed the lion : and this,with abundance of more pastime did10the spirit present to the doctor’s -view,conehiding with all manner of music,with some hundreds of spirits whichcame and danced before Faustus. Af¬ter the music was over, and Faustusbegan to look about him, he saw tensacks full of silver, which he went todispose of, but could not, for none douldhandle it but himself, it was so hot.This pastime did so please Faustus,that he gave the Mephostophiles thewill that he had made, and kept a co¬py of it in his own hands. The spiritand Faustus being agreed, they dwelttogether, and the devil was in theirhouse keeping ; for there was never a-ivy tiring given to the poor, which be¬fore Faustus made this contract wasfrequently done ; but the case is nowaltered.CHAP. V.Ilo.-J Faustus served the Duke of Bavaria.Fawstus, having sold his soul do the11levil, it was reported among his neigh-iours, so that none would keep hisiompaihy, but his spirit, which was verysequent with him, and did whatsoeverie commanded him, playing merryricks for to please Faustus. Not farrom Faustus’s house lived the Dukel)f Bavaria, the Duke of Saxony, and;;he Bishop of Salisburgh, whose hous¬es and cellars Mephostophiles used toivisit, and to bring the best of everyIthing they had. One day the Duke offjB.avaria had invited most of the gentryof the country to dinner, for whose^entertainment there was abundance ofprovision got ready : the, gentry bemg5come, and ready to sit down to dinner,in an instant Mephostophiles came andtook away all with him, leaving themI full of admiration. If at any time Faus-1 tus had a mind for a wild fowl, thespirit would call whole flocks in at awindow ; also the spirit-did teach Faus¬tus to do the like, so that no lock norkey would keep them out. The devilalso taught Faustus to fly into theair, and to act many things which ar<|;i)credible, ond too large for this smallbook to contain.CHAP. VI. jHow Dr Faustus dreamed of Hell in hitsleep, and what he saw there.After Fanstus had a long conferencewith his spirit concerning the fall oflucifer, and the state and condition ofall the fallen angels, he, in a vision ordream, saw hell and all the devils andsouls that were tormented there: healso saw hell divided into several cells,or deep holes ; and for every cell, ordeep v\ard, there was a devil appointedto punish those that were under hiscustody. Having seen this sight he Imuch marvelled at it ; and havingMephostophiles with him, he asked himwhat sort of people they were that layiu the first dark pit ? Mephostophilestold him they were those who pretend¬ed themselves to he physicians, andhadpoisoned many thousands to try prac-13ce ; and now, saith the spirit, theyave administered to them as they did) others, though not with the same"’fifect; for they will never die here,?ath he. Over their heads was a shelf.den with gallipots full of poison,laving past them he came to a longitry, exceeding dark, where there wasmighty crowd. He asked them what]iose were ? the spirit told himiey were pick-pockets; who loved toi in a crowd when they were in theher world, and to content them, theylit them in a crowd there ; amongstliemwas some padders on the highway,jid those of that function. , Walkingrther he saw many thousands of vint-jirs, and some millions of tailors, in-iimuch that they could not tell whence; get stowage for them ; a great num-r of pastry cooks with peels on theiriads. Walking farther, the spiriti?ning a great cellar-door, from which1)se a terrible noise, he asked whatly were ? the spirit told him they;re witches, and those that had been14pretended saints in the other worldbut how they did squabble, fight, antear one another ! not far from therlay the whoremongers and adulterer:who made such a hideous noise, th?he was very much startled. W'alkindbvtbi a few steps, he espied an incredble number, almost hid with smokehe asked what they were ? the spirtold bdn they were millers and bakerbut, good lack, what a noise was theiamong them, the millers crying to t!bakers, and the bakers to the millefor help, but all is in vain, for therenone to help them. Passing on farthhe saw thousands of shopkeepers, sonof whom lie knew, who were torment*for defrauding and cheating their crtomers. Having taken this prosperof hell,-the spirit Mephostophiles to :him in his arms, and carried him houlto his own house, where he awakir iw'as amazed at what he had seen ihis dream. Being come to himself,asked the sjtirit in what place hell wand who made it ; Mephostophi15.twered, knowest thou, that before> fall of Lucifer, there was no hell,t upon his fall, was hell ordained,for the substance of hell, we devilsnot know ; it is the wrath of Godt makes hell so furious, and what1 procured by our fall : but where■I is, or how it is governed, and what-iver thou desirest to know, when thounest there thou shalt be satisfied asknow ourselves.riining some Tricks of Dr Faustus.bfaustus having attained this desirejjpis spirit, had now full power to act10 any thing whatever he pleased ;i a time the Emperor had a desire2e him, and likewise some of theor’s tricks ; whereupon he was re¬nted by the Emperor to do some-t to make him merry ; but thelor in the mean while looking roundijit him, at last espied a lord lookingbat the window, and the doctor call-CHAP.

VIII.How Dr Faustus ate a load of Hay,Faustus, upon a time, having m,.doctors and masters of arts with 1went to walk in the fields, where tj17t with a load of hay : how now goodow, saith Faustus, what shall I givee to fill my belly with hay ? thei‘vn thought he had been a madmaniilk of eating hay, told him heId fill his belly for a penny; toh the doctor agreed, and fell toig, and quickly, devouring half the: at which the doctor’s companionsbed, to see how simply the pooritry fellow looked, and to hear howtily he prayed the doctor to for-r : Faustus, pitying the poor man,t away, and before the man got: home, ^11 t.he hay was in the cart, | the doctor had eaten, which madeteountry fellow admire.CHAP. IX.he struck a parcel of students thatfre fighting together blind ; and how)' served a parcel of clowns who wereinsrinn: and ranting in an inn.T* O O C-’Urteen students meeting with se-more near Df Faustus’s house,fell out extremely, first in words, anfjjlast to blows ; the thirteen being;hard for the seven, and Dr Fanslooking out of his window, and sedthe fray, and how much they were o’match’d, conjur’d them all blind,that one could not see the other ;in this manner they fought and snlone another, which made all thatthem laugh : at length the people ped them, and led them to their chihers; they instantly received sisThe doctor, coming into an inn msome friends, was disturbed by the ilooing and hauling of a parcel of druen clowns, whereupon, when their moi 1were wide open, he so conjured ththat by no means they could shut tiagain; and so all on a sudden tlwas a deep silence ; and after theywaited one upon another, without btable to speak, thinking they were 1witched, they dropped one by one jsinking fear, and never could be gothe house afterwards.19CHAP.

So they Avetimarried the next day, and all by tfc ;help of Dr Faustus.CHAP. XI.How Dr Faustus made seven women dance nakedthe market place.Fausils walking in the market, saw seven \vmen sitting all in a row selling eggs, butter, &Of every one he bought something and departe;No sooner was he gone, but all the eggs and Inter, were gone out of their baskets, and they knernot how ; at last they were told, that Dr Fausthad conjured their goods away ; they thereupiran speedily to the Doctor’s, and demanded sat: .faction for their ware; he resolving to make hirjself and the town’s people merry by his conjurii^rt, made them return to their baskets naked!r they were horn; and having danced a whilehe market-place, every one’s goods were con-d into their baskets again, and they were setberty.CHAP.

XIII.How Dr Fauslus began to bethink himself onear approach rf his endFaustus having spun out his twenty-four \within a month or two, began to consider wiishould do to cheat the devil, hut could noany wav to prevent his miserable end, whiclnow near; whereupon he thus cries out toself, O miserable wretch that I am ! I haveen myself to the devil for a few years pleasuisatisfy my carnal and devilish desires, and nmust pay full dear; now must I have torwithout any ease ; woe is me, for there is nofor me; I dare not, I cannot look for mercyGod; for I have abandoned him, and have jmyself to the devil, to be his for ever ; and1my time is almost expired; I have had m 1sires; my filthy lusts I have satisfied, and I •be tormented for ever and ever.A neighbour of his, a godly old man, he;of his way of living, in compassion to hiscame to him, and with tears besought him tomore regard to his precious soul, laying bhim the promise of God’s grace and mercy, foffered to repenting sinners, and spoke so fee 1ly, that Faustus shed tears and promised to trepent. This good man was no sooner gon ^Mephostophiles found him pensive on his bed *muttering what had happened, began to appi 1him with breach of covenant to his lord Luand thereupon almost twisted his neck rothreatening him so dreadfully, that through ie :confirmed all that he had done before.23r ciiAr. xiv.low Dr Fauslus was warned of the Spirit to pre¬pare for his cud.Lmstus’s full lime being come, the spirit appear-'-to him, and shewed him his writing, and toldijm that the next night the devil would fetch himM ay, which made the doctors heart ache ; but tovert himself, he sent for some doctors and rnas-ir bachelors of arts, and other students to dineIth li im, for whom he provided great store ofirielies, with music and the like ; but all wouldjilt keep up his spirits, for the hour drew near;Shcreiipon his countenance changing, the doctorsd masters of art enquired of him the reason ofs melancholyness ; to which Faust us answered,y friends, you have known me these many years,d bow I have practised all manner of wicked-ss. I have been a conjuror, which devilish art Itained of the devil ; and also to obtain powerdo whatever I pleased. I sold myself to the de¬fer twenty-four years tune; which full timeing out this night, makes me full of horror, Ive called you my friends to see this my dread-end, and I pray let my miserable death he airning to you all, how you study that devilishconjuring, for if you once begin it, a thou-t ond to one!ievbut it will lead you to the devil,of this sad story, blamed him fortelling him if he had madeelh acquainted before, they thought it mightve been prevented. He told them, lie had a de-e several times to have disclosed this intrigue.hearingnceaiing it so Ion;.21and to join with the godly, and leave oft' thwicked course, but immediately the devil usedcome and torment him, ecc. Hut now saith Fautus, it is but in vain for me to talk of what I dintend, for I have sold myself to the devil, boand soul is his. No sooner had he spoke thwords, but suddenly it fell a thundering, whereon Faustus went into the great hall, the doctors amasters staying in the next room, intending to hhis end. About twelve o’clock the house shookterribly, that they thought it would have tumbldown upon their heads ; and suddenly all twindows of the house were broke £o pieces, so tlthey trembled and wished themselves elsewherwhen upona greatclapof thunder, withawhiriwimthe doors llevv open, and a mighty rushing of windetered, with the hissingof serpents, shrieksand crieupon which he lamentably cried out murder, aithere was such roaring in the hall, as if all tldevils in hell had been there.

So ended this miserable wretcfllife, which wre hope may stand as a lasting momment and warning to others. His mangled bo«^in respect to his function, learning, and other quaifications, was decently buried.FINIS

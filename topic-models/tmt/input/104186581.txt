See.THE%SURPRISING ADVENTURES‘Of the RenownedBARON MUNCHAUSEN..# u’} urj * #XiBOUT the beginning of his prerent Majesty'sreign, I had some business with a distant relation,who then lived on the Isle of Thanet; it was afamily dispuT, and not Irhely to be finished soon.—I made it a pradtyce, during my residence there,the weather being fine, to walk out every morning.After a ft« / of the*e excursions, I observed an objcdlon a great eminence, about three miles distant;I extended my walk to it, and found the ruins ofan ancient temple: on the eastern end were therettahns of a lofty tower, near 40 ftet high, over¬grown with ivy, the top apparently fiat: I surveyedit on every side very minutely, thinking that if Icould gain its iJmmit, I should enjoy the most de^Jightful prosptft rf the circumjacent country. Animated by this hope, I resolved, if possible, togain the summit; which I at length cfTcted bymeans of the ivy, tho’not without greit difficultyand danger. The top 1 found covered with thisever-green, *xcept a large chasm in the middle.—Curiosity prompted me to sound the opening, irtorder to ascertain its depth, as I entertained a iTu-.." ^ ( 3 )spicion that it might probably communicate withsome unexplored subterranean cavern in thi hill;but having no line, I was at a loss how to ptcceed.After revolving the matter in my thoughts for sometime, I received to drop a stone down, and listento the echo; which I had no sooner done, than Iheard a rustling below, and suddenly a monstrouseagle put up its head right oppos.ts n y face; andrising pp with irresistible force” cairkd me away,seated on its shoulder'.—I instantly gra p \i it roundthe ne^k, which was large enough to fill my tmis;and its wings, when extended, were ten yards fromcne extremity to the ether.—As it arose’wi h aregular ascent, my seat was perkdliy easy, and I^enjoyed the prosptdl bslow with sn ex pres able plea¬sure.—,lt hovered ever Margate for some time,then dire&ed it course to Dover-cl,ff, where it a-lighted^ and I thought of demounting, but wasprevented by a sudden discharge oi mudestry from3 party of mtrines that were txe.cis v,g on the beach.It in tantly re-asccndcd, and flew over over the seatowards Calais; but so very high coat the Channelto be no broader than the Thames - . London-bridge.In a quarter of an hour 1 fjund myself over a thickwood in France,' where the eagle dctcei-'cd veryrapidly, which caused me to slip down to the backpart of its head; but slighting on a large tree, andraising its head, I recovered my seat as b-fore, butsaw no possibility of disengaging myself, withoutthe danger of being killed by the fail: so I deter¬mined to sit fast. — After resting a few minutes,it to k wirg and proceeded —In tlnee days I sawthe rock or Ch alter vers dbrirft'y —The daybeing clear,notwithstanding my degree ©f elevation, rnthe earth’s surface appeared just like a map, whefiland, sea, lakis, rivers, mountains, and the likewere peife&ly distinguishable; and having sonknowledge of geogeaphy, I was at no less to deter¬mine what part of the globe I was in —My eagle,however, proceedei and looking before me withinexpressible pleasure, I observed that he was pre¬paring to alight, and descended on the top of s veryhigh mountain.—Ac this time the moon, far distantin the west, and oh.cured by dark clouds, bur justafforded light sufficient to discover a kind o£,shrub-b«ry ail around —- The eagle began to staggeragainst the shrubs ; I endeavoured to keep my sear,tut was soon e'.rovyn to some distance among thebushes — In attempting to rise, 1 put my hand ona large hedge.hog which happened to lie amongthe gras- upon its back: It instantly e'esed roundmy hand, so that I found it impossible to shake it off.I struck it several tunes against the ground withoutefivtf-; but white I was thus employed, I heard arustling among the shrubbery, and locking up,I saw a huge animal within three yards of me ! Icould make no defence but held out both my hands,when it.rushed on me, and seized that on whichthe hec’-e-hog war fixed. — My hand being soonrelieved. 1 ran to some distance, where I saw thecreature suddenly drop down and expire, with thehedge hog in its throat !—As soon as day appeared,the eagle fled rff. and I travelled to the town, in¬tending fm- Rome. — 1 travelled post, and findingmyself in a narrow lane, bade the postillion give asignal With hii horn, that ether travellers might notmeet us in the narrow passage.—hie blew with allhis might, bite his endeavours were in vain; he could'15| QQt qiake the horn sound, which wss unaccountablei! and rather unfortunate; tor soon after w« found| another coach coining the other v/ay: there wasi ro proceeding ; however, I got out of my carriage,i and being pretty strong, placed it, wheels and all,; on my head: I then jamped over a hedge aboutnine ieet high (which, considering the weight of: the coach, was rather difficult) into a field, and, came oue again by anothe: jump into the road be-, yond the ether carriage.—1 then went back for thei horses, and placing one on my head, and the otherI under my left arm, by the same means broughtthem to my coach, and proceeded to an inn at thei end of cur stage. — After we arrived at the inr,II my postillion and I refreshed ourselves: he hungli his bon* on a peg near the kitchen’ fire, ana I sati on the other side.—Suddenly we ht^rd a 1 ereng !i tcreng! teng! teng ! We looked round, and nowfound the reason the postillion had ifcat been ableto sound his horn ; his uin£"> were frt zen up in it,and came out now by thawing, plain enough, andt much to the credit of the driver, so that the hontst:'t fellow entertained us for some time with a successiver variety of tunes, without putting In's mouth to theI! horn, to our great astonishment!Having at length arrived at Rome, after flay-I irg a fhort while there, I set cfF from Rome on. a journey to Puissia, in the midst ot winter, on horsc-i hark, as the most convenient manner of travelling.I 1 was but lightly clothed, and of this 1 felt the( inconvenience, the mure I advanced north east.——i Charity, however, induced me to throw my mantlei ever an c!d man, dying a most naked, on a-bie.*.p1 “ l 4 J .   'comaion in Poland.—At length night and darkness lovertook me • no village was to be seen : and thecountry was covered with snow — i'ired, I alighted, ,and fastened my horse to something like a pointedstump of a tree, which appeared above the snow;and lay down on the snow, where I slept so soundly,that 1 did not open my eyes til! full day-light.—Conceive .jy astonishment, to find myself in the |midst of a village, lying in a church yard, r—Myhorse was not to be seen; but I heard him soonEfter neigh somewhere above me. — On lookingupwards, I beheld him hanging, by hi* bridle, (othe weather cock of the s.eeple. — Matters weienow very plain : the village had been covered withsnow over night; a sudden thaw had taken place;I had surk down gentiy to the church yar^ as thesnow had melted away ; and what in the dark I hadtaken to be a stump ef a tree, appearing abovethe snow, proved to Mve been the weather-cock"of the steeple ! I took one of my pistols, shot thebridle in two, brought down the hone, and pro¬ceeded on my journey.■I was at Count Przobosky’s noble country-seat^in Lithuania ; and being it tea, l remained withthe ladies in the drawing-room, while the gentle¬men wore down in the yard, to see a young herseof blood, which was just arrived from the stud.We heard a noise ! 1 hastened down stairs, andfound the horse so unruly, that nobedy durst ap-preach or mount him.— At cr.s leap, 1 was on hisback, took him by surprise, and worked him quiteinto gentleness and obedience/ To shew my horse-ivanahip to the ladies, I forced him to le'-n in at{ 7 )one of the windows of the drawing-room; walkedround several .times, pace, trot, and gallop; and,at last, made hua moui/t the tea-table, there torepeat his lessons in a style which was exceedinglypleasing to the ladies; for he performed them amaz¬ingly well snd did not break * single cup or saucer!The nonle Lord, with his usual politer.ess, beggedI would accept of this young ho. sc, and ride himto Conquest and honor, in ihc campaign againstthe Turks, whic h was soon to be opened, underthe command of Count Munich.Some years before my beard announced ap-, proaching manhood, 1 expressed a strong desire cfii seeing the world, from which I w'as discouragedby my parents. — A cousin, by my mother’s side,took arliking to me, and was much inclined to gra¬tify my curiosity. — His eitqivsnce had more efllclthan mine, for my father consented to my secom-| panyinj* him in a voyage to the Island Ceylon,i and we sailed from Amsterdam -—The only cin um-i stance which h. pper.ed cn cur voyage worth notice,was the wonderful effects of a storm, which had tornup by the roots a great number of trees of enorm-i, ous bulk, that had been carried by the wind so high,th ,t they appeared iike t ae feathers of small birdsfloating in the air; for they were at least nve milesabove the earth I However, as soon as the stormsubsided, they all fell pyptndicuiar into their re¬spective places, and auk root again, except thalargest, which happened when it was blown intothe air, to have a man and his wife on its branches,gathering cucumbers, wlfch here grow on trees !The weight cf this couple, as the tree descended.overbalanced the trunk, and brought it do\yn ina horzontal p«xsition : It fell upon the chief man ofthe Island, and killed him oo the spot, to the greatjoy of the inhabitants!On my return te England, I had o^calion togo down to Wapping to fee fome goods Hiippedfor Hamburgh : after that, 1 took the Tower W hai fin my way back. I was fo much fatigued, that )I ilepped into one of the cannon to coinpofe me, fwhere I fell faft a'leep. This was sbotr aioon; |it was the fourth of June: at one o’clock, .hecannon were difeharged in memory of die day; andI was Ihot over the heufes, on the oppofite fide ofthe river, into a fanner’s yard, where I fell upona large hay-hack, withi ik waking, and continuedthere, in a found fleep, ti l hay berime fo r;;'rava.gantly dear, (which was alaout three niontlis after,)that the farmer found it his intereh to fend 1 iswhole dock to maiket: The (lack I war fepcfmgpipon, was the larged in the yard, containing rbeve ;coo load ; they began to cut that fird. 1 waked,with the voices of the people, who had afeendedthe ladders to begin at the top, and got up, tetaiiyignorant of my iiruition: In attempting 'o rimaway, I fell on the farmer to whom the hay be*longed, and broke his neck, yet received no in¬jury myfeif!Thus, have I related the mod intereding n;.rt ,of my adventures.FINIS,

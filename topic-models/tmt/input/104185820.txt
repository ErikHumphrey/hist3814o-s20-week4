II.iHow Dr. Faust us conjur'd up the De¬vil, making him appear at his house."ffT^AUSTUS, whose n.ind was to stu-dy conjuration, which he followednight and day j he took the Wing ofan eagle and endeavoured to fly over thef world to see and know all the secrets of heaven and earth : in a short time he at-Itained power to command the devil toappear before him when he pleased.One day as Dr. Faustus was walking ina wood, near to^Wiitemberg, in Germa¬ny, he having a friend with him that^was desirous to know the doctor’s art,s he desired him to let him see if he couldit;then and there bring Mephosfophiles be-wfore him ; all which the doctor immsd'i-•4ately did, and the devil upon the firstcall made such a noise in the wood as ifheaven and earth would have come to¬gether ; then, the devil made such aroaring, if the wood had been full ofwild beasns. The doctor made a circlefor the devil, the which circle the de¬vil ran round, making a noise as if tenthousand waggons had been running uponpaved stones. After this it thunderedand lightned as if the whole world hadbeen on fire. Faustus and his friend, a-tnazed at this noise, and the devil’s longtarrying thought to leave the circle ;whereupon the devil made him suchmusic, the like Was never heard in theworld} this so ravished Faustus that hebegan again to conjure Mephostophilesin the name of the prince of the devils,to appear la his own likeness ; whereupon,in an instant, hung over his head a migh¬ty dragon. Faustus calls again after his:former manner, after which there was a,cry in the wood as if hell had been opened,,and all the tormented souls had beenthere ; Faustus, in the mean while askingthe devil many questions, and commandtng him to shew many tricks. .5CHAP. IllHow Mephoslophiles came to Dr.Faustus's house, and •what hap¬pened between them.H T^AUSTUS commanded the spiritto meet him at his house by ten of,, B the clock the next day. At thehour appointed he came into hischamber, asking Faustus |what he would1 have ; Faustus told him, it was his will■ij and pleasure to conjure him to be obedientj to him in all points of those articles, viz.First, That the sphit shall serve him in■fi all things he asked, from"that time till1 his death.Secondly} Whatsoever he would, havefe he should bring him.Thirdly, Whatsoever he desired to know(he should tell him.The spirit answered him and said, hehad no such power of himself, until! he( had acquainted his prince that ruled overhim : for said he, we have rulers over usI1; that send us out, and command us home,’I when they please ; and we can act no far-ther than our power is, which we receivefrom lucifer, who you know for his pridewas thrust out of heaven. But, sait£ thespirit, I am not to tell you any more ex¬cept you make yourself over to us.6Whereupon Faustus said, I will havemy request j but yet I will not be damnedwith you. Then said the spirit, youmust not, nor shall not have your desire,and yet thou art mine, and all the worldcannot save thee-out of my hands. Thensaid Faustus, get thee hence, and I conjurethee, that thou come to me at night. Thespirit then vanished, Faustus then began toconsider how he might obtain his desire,and not to give his soul to the devil.And whi'e Faustus was in these devilishcogitations, night drew on, and this hellishspit it appeared to Faustus, acquaintinghim that now he had orders from hisprince to be obedient to him, and to dofor him whatsoever ho desired provided hewould promise to be his, and withall toacquaint him first what he would have ofhim ? Faustss replied that his desire wastp become a spirit, and that Mephostophil-qs should be always at his command $chat whensoever he called for him, heshall appear invisible to all men, and thatbe should appear in what shape he pleased.To which the spirit answered, that allhis desires should be granted if he wouldsign those articles, he should have whate¬ver, he would wish or ask for ; whereuponjDr Faustus withdrew and pricked hisiji wrist, receiving the blood iaa small saucerI1 which cooleciso fast, as if it forewarnedjj him of the hellish act he was going to com-: mit; nevertheless he put it over embersto warm it, and writ as followeth :I, John Faustus, approved doctor ofdivinity, with my own hand do acknow¬ledge and testify myself to become a ser¬vant to lucifer, prince of Septentrional andOrient, and to him I freely and voluntarygive both body and soul ; in considerationfor the space of twenty four years, if I beserved in all things I shall require, orwhich is reasonable by him to be allowed:at the expiration of which from the dateensuing, I give to him all power to do withme at his pleasure ; to rule to fetch andcarry me where he pleases body and soul:hereupon I defy God and Christ, and allthe host of angels and good spirits j all li¬ving creatures that bear his shape, or onwhom his image is imprinted ; and to thebetter strengthening the validity of thiscovenant and firm agreement between us,-i.I have writ it with my own blood, and sub¬scribed my name to it, calling all the pow¬ers and infernal potentates to witness it ismy true intent and meaning.JOHN FAUSTUS.CHAP. IV.Whal happened to Dr Fauslus afterthe signing of the articles.WHEN Faustus had made am jend of his writing, he called (Mephostophiles to him, and de¬livered him the bond ; where-arpon the spirit told him, that if he did notrepent of what he had doije, he should en¬joy all the pleasure his thoughts couldform, and that he would immediately di¬vert him. He caused a kennel of houndsto run down a hart in the hall, and vanish-^ ied: then a bull danced before Faustus, alsothere was a lion and a bear which fell tolightning before Faustus, and the lion des¬troyed the bear ; after that came a drago/iand destroyed the lion : and this, withbundance of more pastime did the spiritpresent to the doctor’s view* concludingwith all manner cf music, with some hun¬dreds of spirits which came and dancedbefore Faustus. After the music 4was o-ver, and Faustus- began to look about him,he saw ten sacks full of silver, which hewent to dispose of but could not, for none^ 9could handle it but himself, it was «o hot.This pastime did so please Faustus, thathe gave Mephostophiles the will that hemade, and kept a copy of it in his ownhands. The spirit and Faustus being agreedthey dwelt together, and the devil was intheir house-keeping ; for their was neverany thing given aw^y to the poor, whichbefore Faustus made this contract was fre¬quently done, but the case is now altered.CHAP. V.How Faustus Served the Duke ofBavaria,Faustus having- sold his soul tothe devil it was reported among hisneighbours, so that none wouldkeep his company, but his spiritwhich was very frequent with him anddid whatsoever he commanded him, play¬ing merry tricks for*.to please Faustus.Not far from Faustus’s house lived theDuke of Bavaria, the Dulce of Saxony,and the Bishop ol Salisbury, whose hou¬ses and cellars Mephostophiles used, and tobring the bgsj: of every thing they had :one day tire Duke of Bavaria had invitedmost of the gentry of the country to-din¬ner,'for whose entertainment there was a-bundance of provisions made ready : thegentry being come, and ready to sit downto dinner, in an instant Mephostophilescame and took away all with him, leavingthem fall of admiration. If any timeFaustus had a mind for a wild fowl, thespirit would call whole flocks in at a win¬dow ; also the spirit did teach Faustus todo the like, so that now no lock nor keycould keep them out. The devil alsotaught Faustus to fly into the air, and to jact many things which are incredible, andtoo large for this small book to contain.CHAP VI.How Dr Faustus dreamed of hell inhis sleep and what he saw there.AFTER Faustus had a long confer- jence with his spirit concerning thefall of lucifer, and the state andcondition of all the fallen angels,' he, in a vision or dream, saw hell and allthe devils and souls that were tormentedthere : he also saw hell divided into seve¬ral cells, or deep holes ; and for every cell,or deep ward, there was a devil appointed50 punish those that were under his custo- .dy. Having seen this sight be much mar¬velled at it \ and having Mephostophileswith him. he asked him what sort of people>hey were that by in the first dark pit ?11Mephostophiles told him they were thosesrho pretended themselves to be physiciansmd had poisoned many thousands to trypractice ; and now saith the .spirit they have;he same administered to them a^they didco others, though not with the same effect,“or they will never die here saith he. Overtheir heads was a shelf laden with gallipotsTill of poison. Having past them, he cameo along entry exceeding dark, where therevas a mighty crowd, he asked them whathose were ? the spirit told him they wererick-pockets ; who loved to be in a crowdwhen they wefe in the other world, and tocontent them, they put them in a crowdhere, amongst them were some padders onhe highway, and those of that function.(Walking further he saw many thousands .)f vintners, and some millions of taylors,insomuch that they could not tell whencey o get stowage for them ; a great numberxi ff pastry-cooks with peels on their heais.Walking further, the spirit owning a greatcellar door, from which arose a terrible--noise, he asked what they were ? the spiritold him they were witches, and those thathad been pretended saints in the otherivorld ; but how they did stjuable, figjVt.and tear one another ! not far from themjay the whoremongers and adulterer^ whoirtade euchvery mucha hideous noise that he w,startled. Walking downfew steps, he espied an incredible number,almost hid with smoke ; he asked whaithey were ? the spirit told him they wermillers and bakers j but, good lack, whaia noise was there among them, the millercrying to the bakers and the bakers to th(millers for help, but all was in vain, forthere was none to help. them. Passing odfurther he saw thousands of shopkeepers,some of whom he knew, who were tormenteu for defrauding and cheating theircustomers. Having taking this prospectof hell, the spirit Mephostophiles tookhim in his arms and carried him home tohis own house, where he awaking, was a-mazed at what he had seen in his dream.Being come to himself, he asked the spi¬rit in what place hell was, and who madeit ; Mephostophiks answered, knowesithou, that before the fall of Lucifer, therewas no hell,*but upon his fall, was ordain¬ed. As for the substance of hell we devils do not know ; it is the wrath of Gocthat makes hell so furious, and what w«procured by our fall : but where hell isor how it is governed, and whatesoeve:thou desirest to know when thou comesthere thou,shalt be satisfied as far as wknow cursc’v''1' *13.. CHAP VII.Containing some Tricks of UrFaustus,’ t tDR Faustus having attained his de¬sire of his spirit, had now fullpower to act or do any thingwhatever he pleased ; upon atime the Emperor had a desire to see him,and likewise some of th& doctor’s tricks jwhereupon he was requested by the em¬peror to do somewhat to make him merry,but the doctor in the mean while lookinground about him, at last espied a lordlooking out at the window, and the doctorcalling his spirit to help him, he in an in¬stant fastened a large pair of horns uponthe lord’s head, that he could not get hishead in till Faustus took the horns offagain, which were soon taken off invisibly:the lord whom Faustus had served so* wasextremely vexed, and resolved to be reven¬ged on the doctor, and to that end, lay amile out of tov/n for Faustus’s passing by,he being that day to depart from the coun¬try ; Faustus coming by the wood side, be¬held the lord mounted upon a mighty war-likehorse, who ran full drift against Faus¬tus, who by the hdp of his spirit, tookhim and all, and carried him before theemperor’s palace, and grafted a pair ofhorns on Ms head as big as an ojj’s :which he could never be rid of, but worethem to his dying day.CHAP. VHI.*How Dr. Faustus eat at loadof hay,FAUSTUS, upon a time, havingmany doctors and masters of artswith him, went to walk in the field,where they met with a load of hay:how now, good fellow, saith Faustus,what shall I give thee to fill my belly withhay ? the clown thought he had been amad-man to talk of eating hay, told himhe should fill his belly for a penny ; towhich the doctor agreed, and fell to eat-‘ing, and quickly devouring half the load :at which the doctor’s companions laughed,to see how simply the poor country fellowlooked, and to hear how heartily he pray-ed the doctor to forbear : Faustus pityingthe poor man went away, and before theman got near home, all the hay was in thecart that the doctor had eaten, which madethe country fellow adorre.CHAP. IX.Ho®» he struck a ’parcel of studentsthat were fighting together blind;and how he served a parcel ofclownswho were singing and ranting in aninn.THIRTEEN students meeting withseven more near Dr. Faustus’shouse, fell out extremely, first inwords, and at last to blows thethirteen being too hard for the seven,and Dr. Faust us looking out of his windowand seeing the fray and how much theywere over matched, conjured themail blind,so that one could not see the other; andin this manner they fought and smote oneanother, which made all that saw themlaugh ; at length the people parted themand led them to their chambers, and theyinstantly received sight. The doctor com-ming into an inn with some friends wasdisturbed by the hallowing and bawling ofa parcel of drunken clowns, whereuponwhen their mouths were wide open he soconjured them, that by no means theycould shut them again ; and so all on asudden there was a deep silence ; and af¬ter they had stared one upon another, with¬out being able to speak, thinking they wereISbewitched they dropped one by otfe awayin a stinking fear, and never could be gotto the house afterwards.CHAP X.Mow Dr Faustus helped a youngman to a lady.There was a gallant young gentlemanthat was in love with a fair ladywho was of proper personage, nearWirtemberg, near the doctor’shouse : this gentleman had long sougktthis lady in marriage, but could not attainhis desire ; and hav/'ng placed his affectionsso much upon her, he was ready to pineaway, and had certainly died with griefhad he not made his address to the doctor,to whom he opened the whole matter.No sooner had the gentleman told his caseto the doctor, but he told him he need notfear, for his desire should be fulfilled,and that this gentlewoman should havenope but him, which w'as accordinglydone; for Faustus so changed the mindof the damsel by his damnable practice,that she could think of nothing else buthim she before hated; and Faustus’s de¬sire was thus; he gave him an enchantedring, which he ordered him to put intothe lady’s hand, or to slip it on her finger,17; which he did ; and no sooner had she thering but her heart burnt with love to him;i she instead of frowns, could do nothing butsmile upon him, and not be at rest till sheasked him if he thought he could love her,aud make her his wife ? he gladly answer¬ed, with all his heart. So they were mar¬ried the next day, and all by the help ofDr Faustus.CHAP XI.How Dr Faustus made seven womendance naked in the market place.FAUSTUS walking in the marketsaw seven women sitting all in arow selling eggs, butter, kc. Ofevery one be bought somethingand departed. No sooner was he gone,but all the eggs and butter were gene outI of their baskets, and they knew not how :at last they were told, that Dr Faustus hadxonjured their goods away ; they thereu¬pon ran speedily to the doctor’s, and de¬manded satisfaction for their ware ; he re-tsolving to make himself and the town’s^people merry by his conjuring art, made5them return to their baskets naked as everlever they were born and having dancediawhile in the market place, every one’sgoods Were conjured into their baskets a-gain, and be set them at their liberty.18CHAP. XII.Now Faustus served a coutry fellowthat wus driving of swine.DR 7austus, as he was going toWirtemberg overtook a countryfellow driving an hundred swine,which was very headstrong, somerunning one way and some another j sothat the driver could not tell how to getthem along : the doctor taking noticeof it, by his conjuring art, made eve¬ry one of them dance upon their two;hind legs, with a fiddle in one of theirfore feet, and with the other fore foot theyplay’d upon the fiddle, and so they dancedand fiddled all the way till they came intoWirtemberg market. The driver of themall the way dancing before them, whichmade the people wonder : after the doctorhad satisfied himself with the sport he con¬jured the fiddles away, and the driverthen offered to sale, and quickly soldthem all, and took the money ; bulbefore he was gone out of the houseFaustus had conjured the hogs out othe market place, and sent them al! ^home to the aforesaid driver’s houseThe man that bought them seeing al'X:19the swine gone, slop’d the man thatsold them, and would have his moneywhich he was forced to pay, and so re¬turned home sorrowfull,and not knowing what to do ; but, to his great a-imazement, found all his swine in theirtetyes.CH *JP XIII.7/ow Dr Fauslus began to bethinkhimself ofthe near approach ofhis end*•g i^AUSTUS having spun out hisI IjM twenty four years, within amonth or two, began to consi¬der what he should do to cheat[.he devil, but could not find any wayto prevent his miserable end, whichwas now near; whereupon he thusjriesoutto himself, O miserable wretchthat I am, I have given myself to theJlevil for a few years pleasure, to satis-|y my carnal and devilish desires, and^iow I must pay full dear ; now mustI pay full dear; now must I have tor-icnt without any ease; woe is me,or there is no help for me: I dare; ot, I cannot look for mercy from God,20 <for I have abandoned him, and havegiven myself to the devil, to be his forever: and now my time is almost ex¬pired ; I have had my desires; myfilthy lusts I have satisfied ; and I must. be tormented for ever and ever.heiiiiug ui ins \Miy » living, in uum-regard to his precious soul, laying be-;fore him the promise of God’s gracejand mercy, freely offered to repenting'sinners, and spoke so feelingly, thatFanstus shed tears, and promised to itry to repent. This good man was no* ssooner gone but Mephostophiles found;him pensive oh his bed, and suspect- ting what had happened, began to re¬proach him with breach of covenant jto his lord lucifer, and thereupon ai- ;most twisted his neck behind him, bwhich made him cry out most lament- rably, threatening to tear him in pieces, usunless he renewed his obligation, whief r,for fear, with mud sorrow he did, iti/21ija manner the same as the former,which he confirmed bv the letter.CHAP. XIV,How Dr. Faustus was warned of thespirit to prepare for his end.FAUSTUS’sfull time being comethe spirit appeared to him, andshewed him his writing, and toldhim that the next night the de¬vil would fetch him away, which madethe doctor’s heart ake; hut to diverthimself, he Bent for some doctors andmaster batchelors of arts, and otherstudents to dine with him, for whomhe provided great store of varieties,with music and the like ; but all wouldnot keep up his spirits, for the hourdrew near : whereupon his counte¬nance changing, the doctors and mas¬ters of art enquired of him the reasonsof his melancholiness; to which Faus¬tus answered, my friends, you haveknown me these'many j ears, and howI have practised all manner of wicked¬ness, 1 have been a great conjuror,which devilish art I obtained of thedevil; and also to obtain power to dowhatever I pleased* I sold myself to )the devil for twenty four years time; ,which full time being out this night, jmakes me f»d] of hnrmr, I have calledyou my friends to see this my dread¬ful end ; and I pray let my miserabledeath be a warning to you all, howyou study that devilfeh art of conjur¬ing; for if you once begin it, a thou¬sand to one but it will lead you to thedevil, whither I am this night to gowhether I will or no. They hearing jof this sad story, blamed him for con- *cealing it so long, telling him if he hadmade them acquainted before, theythought it might have been prevented.He told them, he had a desire severaltimes to have disclosed this intrigue, jbut the devil told him if he did, he |would presently fetch him away; he ;also told them, he had a desire to joinwith the godly, and leave off thatwicked course, but immediately thedevil used to come and torment him,&c. But now, saith Faustu's, it is but Iin vain for me to talk of what I di<lintend, for I have sold my&elf to thedevil, body and soul is his. No soon¬er had he spoke these words, but sud¬denly it fell a thundering and light¬ning, the like was never heard; where¬upon Faustus went into the great hall,the doctors and masters staying in thenext room, intending to hear his end.‘I About twelve o’clock the house shookiso terribly, that they thought it wouldhave tumbled down upon their heads;jJ and suddenly all the windows of thehouse were broke to pieces, as if allnature had been changed; so thatthey trembled and wished themselvesdsewhere ; when upon a great clapof thunder, with a whirlwind the doors1 flew open, and a mighty rushing ofr wind entered, with the hissing of ser-j pents, shrieks and cries, upon whichf he lamentably cried out murder, andt there was such roaring in the hall, asi if all the devils in hell had been there.When day-light appeared, they tookthe boldness to enter the room, and24iounfl his brains beaten out againstthe wall, and the.floor sprinkled withblood ; and his eyes torn out, veryterrible to behold; but missing thebody, they went in search of it, andfound it on the dung-hill, mangledand mashed to pieces, so ended thismiserable wretch’s life, forsaking Godand all goodness, and given up to hisimplacable enemy, which we hopemay stand, not only as a fearful, butlasting monument and warning toothers. His mangled body in respectto his function, learning, and otherqualifications, was decently buried.FINIS.

SCOUNDREL WILL’SDYICE TO HIS SONS,ANDTHE SONS’ EEPLY.“ Vice is a monster of so frightful mein,As to be hated needs but to be seen.”—Pope.LOCHMABEN1847.SCOUNDREL WILL’S ADVICETO HIS SONS.Scene—A Farmer's Spence, not many miles from the famousTown of Lochmaben,“ My son, give me thine heart, and let thine eyes observe my ways.”Solomo x.1.Sit down, my sons, and hear your father;I for your sakes have called you hither,Before auld age begins to witherThis frame of mine,And I my business, altogether,To you resign.2.I care not though my neighbours clashAbout the way I’ve made my cash,And view me as a dirty trash.And wish me ill,And call me an unfeeling hash,And scoundrel Will.3.I let them talk. Without their aidA little money I have made ;And if to what may now be saidYe’ll a’ take heed,In ony line, I’m not afraid,But ye’ll succeed.44.A score of years are more than runSince I, with only one pound one,In business for myself begunMy lot to try,And found this world required a manStern, deep, and sly.5.A man as subtle as auld Nick,Prepar’d to meet or play a trick ;Who would at nothing stand or stick,But boldly strive,By every means, through thin and thick.His point to drive.6.So ticklish now is every trade,No business-man well can evadeTelling at times what may he saidTo he a lie ;And none to cheat are now afraid,’Tis do or die.7.Men might he honest long ago,And justice like a stream might flow ;But times are altered so much so,That I may say.An honest man is not belowThe sun this day.8.Truth, honour, justice, and so forth.Have long been banish’d from the earth ;Had I been honest since my birth,I had not beenThe man I am, nor ever worthA penny preen.9.Ye know’ yourselves as well as I,I work twa farms, and sell and buyAll kinds of victual, horse, and kye,And d n the skin,However selfish, shrewd, or sly.Could tak’ me in.510.I early in my life beganThe business world to weigh and scan,And many a wary, cunning manI bad to cheat,By some ingenious shift or plan.My bills to meet.11.In years when grain was raw and light,So fozy it would scarcely dight,I look’d around me, left and right,As sharp ’s a razor,Till I got some unskilful wightTo buy by measure.12.When want of straw was nae drawback,But in the ear I saw a lack,I some way always had the nackOf coaxing foolsTo buy in slump, so much the stack,Grain, straw, and hools.* 13.When markets seemed upon the fall,I on a wealthy sot would call,Along with friends who could enthrallWi’ drink the cuif,And swear next day he bought my all.And they were proof.14.Mind, few with me can baud or draw.Brow-beat, hoodwink, contend, or thraw ;Or if they do, away to lawAt once I travel;For there, with lies, and tricks, and jaw,I’ll beat the devil.15.I know a little lawyers’ lore ;And, as I hinted at before.In any pinch I have a core,All cut and dry.To swear, on every point and score,The greatest lie.' . ^A J|616.Without compunction, dread, or fright.They swear for me that wrong is right;While I, in turn, to them, as mightBe well expected.Stand bound to swear that black is wdiite.As I’m directed.17.’Tis said, and I believe it too.That oaths are awful if untrue;But, mighty Jove ! what can we do,In these sad times ?Sins of the very blackest hueAre common crimes.18.Besides, I’m told, by those who know it.When we to cheat are driven to it,The cause that drives us on to do itShould bear the blame ;Nature and common sense allow it,In Justice’ name.19'At all times for a weighty purseA boundless love be sure to nurse ;For honour never mind a curse,Adopt a rule,To pay no more than law can force,Be’t foir or foul.20.Pick all ye can from simple snools ;Keep mind, that all the golden rulesPoor silly pedants teach in schoolsAre unavailing,Or only acted on by fools,Not men of dealing.21.The course with tradesmen to pursue,When their accounts they hand to you,Condemn their jobs, seem furious tooAt their amounts,Till large per centages ye screwFrom their accounts.22.This is the way that I have wrought,And all my worldly battles fought,That ye should get the meals ye ought.And olaes ye need.And ne’er to poverty be brought,And beg your bread.23.Wha gets of worldly gear a slice.Must close his hand as firm’s a vice,And have a heart as cauld as ice.Besides a headThat can see all things in a triceClear as a bead.24.Drinking resist, as far’s yc can,That nobody may you treoan;Take mankind all to be a clanOf rogues together:Never forget the simple man’S the beggar’s brother.25.My sons, as polities are kittle.Say nought about them, think as little ;Be subject aye; ne’er mind a spittleWha wears the crown ;Leave statesmen state affairs to settle.Mind ye your own.26.The time is drawing nigh, no doubt,When ye’ll for wives be looking out;But, gudesake 1 never think aboutWives that are bonnie ;Be all of you on the pursuitOf wives with money.27.Although their cheeks are like the rose.Their lips like cherries, eyes like sloes.And bosoms like the mountain snows,On no pretenceShould you presume to even thoseTo pounds and pence.828.Let flaunting beauty ne’er hoodwinkYour understandings, learn to thinkBeauty skin-deep but lasts a blink,A thing ideal;Whereas, the solid sterling clinkIs something real.29.They must be void of sense or thoughtWho marry women having nought;—Wives, and wives friends, have often broughtMen to the door;They are, at least, a d d down-draughtIf they be poor.30.Who—g is had, I’ll not deny;Yet wh—s may do to put you bye,Till each of you has fixed an eyeUpon a lass.Blessed with the charms the wise envy—The charms of brass.31.Now, to conclude:—I recommendStrict piety ; at least, pretend;And constantly the kirk attendOn Sabbath day;And morn and night at your fire-endSing psalms and pray.32.Suppose you swindle, lie, and cheat.And practice every low deceit.At making cash you will be beatIn many ways,If you at church desert your seatOn Sabbath days.33.’Tis much your interest here to passAmong the douse religious class ;The kirk-attender always hasA most prodigiousAdvantage o’er the stupid assWho’s not religious.934.Belong, at least, to some profession.And try to get among the session ;If guilty then of some transgressionYe cannot hide.You have at least a congregationAll on your side.35.In this, my sons, I’ve done to youWhat prudence prompted me to do ;But as the lads are waiting nowOur reading time ;The Word of God let us fall to,—Let’s chaunt a hymn.THE REPLY OF THE SONS TOTHEIR FATHER.An honest man, though ne'er so poor.Is chief o’ men for a' that.”—Beans.Dear father, we have heard your story,And as your head is getting hoary,To differ from you we are sorry;And yet we need,Seeing that in your sins you glory,Constrained by greed.Honour to parents is their due,When they perform what they should do ;But the harangue we’ve heard from youDiscloses baseDishonest bye-roads to pursue,Dark crooked ways.We will not take yon for our guide,Nor in your wicked schemes confide ;Our mother, too, is on our side,Whose hope and trust is,We shall by honesty abide,Truth, law, and justice.12.3,’’"r—sat114.On you we keep an anxious eye,Anti see you never out the fry,Sometimes about the beasts ye buy,Exchange or sell,Te by defending one great lieA hundred tell.5.At deeds like yours our hearts recoil,And sicken at the projects vile,Which you gloss o’er in words like oil,Smooth and paternal;Conveying precepts, all the whileBase and infernal.6.No wonder neighbours wish you ill,And fain would see you down the hill;And you the name of “ Scoundrel Will ”At last have gotten ;A name that will continue tillYou ’re dead and rotten.7.We do intend, come weal or woe.By strict integrity to go,That on our conduct none may throwThe smallest blame :—What can the world on us bestowLike a good name ?8.We cannot dwell on all you’ve said,The despicable speech ye made ;But some revolting tricks ye playedWe will not pass,That would of common thieves degradeThe lowest class9.It seems, from the discourse we got.You and your colleagues are a lotOf downright knaves, who daily plotTo drive a tradeOf cramming bargains down folk’s throatThey never made.1210,How can ye stand before a court,And there with truth and justice sport;If any miscreants can resortTo what you tell;There cannot be a blacker sortOf fiends in h—11.The loopy thimble-rigging squad,Whom law condemns, are not so badAs you, the paragons of fraud.Who mankind gnaw,And strut about, well fed and clad,Defying law.With robbers on the Queen’s highway,Men may get something like fair play ;They may retreat, or keep at bay,In self-defence;But with you rascals, where have they, The smallest chance ?13.There ’s simple Symon down the gate,You dragg,’d-liim to the court of late ;A cow you swore he sold you atHalf-price when fou ;Though all a lie, yet what of that ?You got the cow.14. ’A baker once to court you broughtFor wheat returned, you said was bought.Sample and stock compared, he thdughtDid not agree ;Though he was right, yet that was nought,You won the plea.With grief and pain, the truth to state,You wronged the man, though he was beat;He had, for sending backfire wheat,Occasion ample;Yet ye maintained he was the cheat,And changed the sample.1112,15,. ' :V,~ ..1316.Had ye no pity, no regret,No sympathy for widow Kate ?The man who took her whole estate,The wheel she span at,Must surely have a breast of slate,A heart of granite.17.Te sent your mandates o’er the knowe,And roup’d her out, both stick and stow ;She got from you a new-ealved cowShe could not pay;And really little wonder how,It died next day.18.Ye saw, and likewise had been told,It had the murrain e’er ’twas sold ;And yet the beast ye did upholdIn health uncommon.And palmed it on, the silly oldPoor widow woman.19.Your servants you have hungered, too ;And when at terms their fees were due.Their petty faults you would reviewIn grim array,And from their little carpi ngs screwOne-half away.20.If some who served you chose to stateWhat they about you could relate.The world your deeds would execrateBy pen and tongue,And honest men, without regret.Could see you hung.21.We overheard you lately say.When starting to the town with hay,“ Lads, when ye weigh it by the way,Tram griths keep on.”This made some forty, by foul play.Weigh fifty stone.Mi'<u.: §“MB1422'Horses ye bought that would not tame,Crib-biters, reesters, blind, and lame,And sold them under some false, nameAt far-off fairs,.Telling your victims that ye cameFrom Girn-the-Hares.23.Why wish our souls to cash confined,The object of a groy’ling mind ?And why to politics be blind VWe have good causeTo learn, as well as all mankind,Our rights and laws.24,We have a firm determination,To know the business of the nation.Its government and legislation.Top, branch, and rootWithout this much of informationA man’s a brute.25.Nought seemingly can you unfoldBut money make and’money hold,By means that ne’er before were told,Though used, forsooth.By you, that has exchanged for gold.Honour and truth.26.Still, money we do not despise,Nor yet above its value prize ;If ever in this world we riseTo have a mailing.It will not be by tricks and lies.And double-dealing.27.Who to believe could o’er be given,That any parent under heaven.Would toll Ids sons, by av’rice driven," Than marry poor,Untockered lasses, they were eveni « Better to wh—re !• * •; 28.You speak'to Us as we were boors,Rude Hottentots, or savage Modrs,That could be led to go with wh—resThan marry women.Who don’t possess that god of yours.Or, rather, demon.29.To marry those we are inclined.Who have to mental virtues joinedHearts faithful, complaisant, and kind.And faces bonnie.In spite of your low grov’ling mindAnd devil—money.30.No other subject we will start.But come to the concluding part.Where you, with deep design and art,Have recommended,Though not religious at the heart.We should pretend it.31.To kirk on Sunday we will go.As long as conscience dictates so ;But whether we attend .or no’,’ Tis something odd.If mankind should have ought to do’Twixt us and God.32.So far as our experience,can.The laws of God and nature scan ;Virtue, we think, should make the man.And not professions,Whether he gets the praise or banOf kirks or sessions.33.If our transactions everywhere -Are unimpeachable and fair.If none we willingly ensnare.By word or deed,What right has any man to careAbout our weed ?.1634.From man that charity we want.Which we to them as freely grant :Deep in all hearts we would implantThat toleration.Like light and heat which God has sentO’er all creation.Now, one remark, and we conclude :—We trust and hope yet to bo proud.To leam this lecture did you good,And ye began,To be what ye ne’er understood—Ready for the Press, and shortly will be Published, The La»tSpeech and Dying Words of Scoundrel Will, who died by thehands of the common executioner, on the scaffold of public opinion,17th September, 1847.35.An honest man.Also, His Epitaph.,rjftms.

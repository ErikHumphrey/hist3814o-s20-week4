Lumsden & Sop.-1820.THE(SOMICAL TRANSACTIONSOFLOTHIAN TOM.•' • *' tPART I.HIS Thomas Black, vulgarly calledLothian Tom, after his native county,was born four miles from Edinburgh.His father being a very wealthy farmer,gave him good education, which he wasvery awkward in receiving, being a verywild, cross, and mischievous boy.l. When he was about ten years of age,he was almost killed by the stroke ofa horse’s foot, which his father had, whohad a trick of kicking at every personthat came in behind him; but when Tomwas got heal of the dreadful woundwhereof many thought he wmld havedied, to be even with the horse, he getsa clod, or piece of a tree, full of woodenpins, fuch as Ihoe-makers use to foftentheir leather upon, and with a rope hetied it to the coupk:-bauk in the ftable,directly oppofite to the horfe’s tail; thengets up on the bauk, and gives it a fwing( 3 >I back, fo that the pikes in the end of it*; came frill drive againft the horse’s arfe,i! which made him to fling : and the more! he flung and ftruck at it, it reboundedback again* and ftruck him : The battleI lasted with great fury, for a long time*i which was good diverfion to Tom, untilhis father, hearing fome difturbance in; the ftable, came in to know the matter,and was furprifed when he faw the poorhorfe tanning his own hide, with his legsall cut and bloody, he cut the rope, andthe battle was ended. But the poor horse(ifwould never kick at any that came be¬hind him afterwards, but always ranfrom it.2. It happened one day that Tom went*iia-flihing, and brought home a few smallr.filh, which his grandmother's cat snapt up; in the dark ; so Tom, to have justice of■ the cat for so doing, catches her, and puts’her jnto a little tub, or cog, then fets hera-drift into a mill-dam, ordering her to; go a-fifhing for herself; then sets out two.or three dogs upon her, when a most ter¬rible sea-fight ensued, as ever was seenion fresh-water ; for if any of the dogs:assayed to board her, by setting in ovemtheir nose, hadrons came flying to that;1 quarter, to repulse him .with her claws:( 4 )thea the veffel was like to be overfet bythe weight of herfelf, fo/he hath to fleeto the other ; and finding the fame there,from thence to the mkidle,, where fhe fat- mewing, always turning hcrfelf. about,combing their no^es.with her foot Theold woman, being informed of the-dan¬gerous fituation of her dearly beloved cat,came runing with a long pole to beat offthe dogs, and haul her afttore. Whatnow, fays Tom, if you be going to takepart with my enemies, you fhall have»an of their reward i Then gives thaold woman fuch a pufh, that (he tumbledinto the - dam over, head and ears, befideher beloved cat, and would undoubtedlyhave perifhed in the, water, had not one«f the people, who was there looking atthe diverfion, come to her relief.3. After this Tom was fent to thefchool, to keep his hand out of an ill turn:And having an old cankered, crab-wittedfellow for his dominie, they were alwaysat variance ; for if Tom had got his whips,which he often deferved, he was fure tobe revenged upon his mafter again for it.So ..Tom perceiving that his mafter hada clofe-ilool in a little clofet within theSchool, where he went to eafe himfelf,Tom gets a penny-worth of gun-powder.and sprinkled it on the ground, directlybefore the seat, and lays a little of italong in a train to the fire-side; thenobserving when his Master went into it,and as he was loosing down his breeches,sets fire to the train, which blew it allabout his Master’s bare hips, ahd scorchedhim terribly, besides the fright, for whichTom was severely whipt ; yet, in a littleafter, he revenged it on his Master.4. So it happened one day, as Tomwent into his Master’s house, the wifewas stooping into a big meal-barrel, tobring out some meal ; Tom takes herby the feet and coups her up into thebarel with her head down, and her bareback-side uppermost; then runs into theSchool, crying. O Master, Master! theDe’il’s looking out o* your meal stand, wi'a fat face, and a black ill-faur’d mouth :yon’s just Auld Nick, if he be living —At this the Master ran with all the speedhe could, to see what it was, and found itto be his own wife speechless and almostsmothered to death; but as she could nottell who did it, Tom got clear off; yethe was not satisfied without some morevengeance on the old fellow; and know¬ing his Master had a fashion, when hewas going to whip the boy s, if they would( 6 )liot loose their breeches willingly, he drewhis knife and cut them through the waist¬band behind: So Tom goes to a butcher,and gets a raw pudding, and fills it with. blood and water, and puts it within thewaistband of his breeches, then goes tothe school next day, and, as the master, was sitting with his back towards the fire.Tom lights a piece of paper, and sets hiswig in a, low, which burnt for some timeunperceived, until the flames came fiz¬zing about his ears! He first put outthe flames by trampling on the wig, andbeing informed that Tom did it, flies tohim in a, rage, ordering him to loose hisbreeches, but Tom tokl him he was neverso mad; then he drew his knife, andwhips poor Tom over his knee, and withgreat kicking and flruggling, cuts thewaifl-band of his breeches, thro’puddingand all, so that the blood gushed out, andTom cried out Murder*! Murder! anddown he fell ; the poor Dominie ran outat the door crying and wringing his hands.Word flew about that Tom was sticketby the Dominie, which made the peoplecome riming from several parts of thecountry roundabout, to see how it was;but on searching him, they found onlythe empty pudding, which discovered thefraud: Then two men had-to get horses( 7 )and ride after the poor Dominie, wtiohad by this time got two or three milesaway, and when he saw them comingafter him, crying to stop and come backagain, lie ran the faster, until he couldrun no more, but fell over oh the road,praying them to let him go, for, if he wastaken back, he was sure to be hanged jand would not be persuaded Tom wasalive, until they forced him back, and hesaw him, but he would be Tom’s teacherno longer; so Tom’s father had to seekanother master for him. _|| PART II.5. There was a young woman servantto Tom’s father, whom Tom had offendedby some of his tricks, and she, to be upwith Tom again, one night spread a hand¬ful of short nettles in his bed, betweenthe sheets, which stung his legs and thighsso much that he was obliged to quite hisbed for some part of the night; for whichhe resolved to be revenged, whenevera proper opportunity offered. It hap¬pened in a tew days after, that she wasinvited to a wedding, where the dancingand diversion induced her to stay all night j( 8 )and in coming home in the morning, hermistress set her to vrash seme tiothef.Bnt site being fatigued with her night’*diversion, and for want ot rest, teli lastasleep with her hands extended in thetub, and standing on her feet with herbelly leaning on the tub; Tom perceiv¬ing this, slips her petticoats and smockover her head letting the sun shine onher bare back-side, which faced "the high¬way. Several people passing by, whileshe continued in this posture, some ofthem weie diverted, and others ashamedat the sight; but a poor cadger had themisfortune to be coming on the road attlie time, and his horse taking frightat this unusual sight, threw off the creel*and broke they poor man’s eggs all tosmash; which so enraged him, that helashed her buttocks with his whip, insuch an unmerciful manner, that with thesmart and shame together, she had notthe least inclination to sleep for the re¬maining part of that day.6. Tom being grown up to the yearsand age of a man, thought himself w iserand more artful then his father; andthere were several things about the househe liked better then to work ; so he turnedto be a dealer amongst the brutes, a cow*C 9 )per of horfe* and cows, * &c.‘ and evenwet ware amongit the brewers and brandyfhops, until he cowped himfelf to thetoom halter : and then his parents wouldfupply him no more. He knew well hisgrandmother had plenty of money, butfhe would give him none, but the oldwoman had a good black cow of her own :So Tom went to the fields one evening,and catches and takes her into an oldwafte houfe which Hood at a diftanccfrom any other, and there he kept hertwo or three days, giving her meat anddrink when it was dark at night, and'made the old woman believe fomebodyhad ftolen the cow for their winter'smart, which was grief enough to theold woman, for the lofs of her dearlybeloved cow. However, fhe employsTom to go to a fair that was near-by,and buy her another; gives him threePounds, which Tom accepts of verythankfully, and promifes to buy one aslike the other as he poffibly could get rThen he gets a piece of chalk, andbrays it as fmall as meal, and fteeps i{in a little water, and therewith rub* overthe cow’s face and back, which madeher baith brucket and rigget: So Tom,in the morning, takes the cow to apublic house within a little of the fair.( )and left her till the-fair was over, and |:lthen drives her home, before him ; and, |jjas soon as they came home, the cow be- }i ■gan to rout as she used to do, which made fthe old woman to rejoice, thinking it was jher own black cow, but, when she sawher white face, fighed and said, Alas!tjhou’ll ne'er be like the kindly brute, ]my Black-lady, and yet routs as like heras ony ever I did hear ; But, says Tomto himself, ’Tis a mercy you know notwhat she says, or all would be wrong yet.So in two or three days the old womanpul forth her braw rigget cow in the |imorning with the rest of her neighbour’s |j;cattle, but it came on a sore day of heavynain, which washed away all the white ||IVom her face and back, so that the oldwoman’s Black-lady came home at night, jland her rigget cow went away with the ||shower, and was never heard of: But !Tom’s father having some fufpicion, and Ilooking narrowly into the cow’s face, jfound some of the chalk not walked away^ |and then he gave poor Tom a heartybeating, and sent him away to seek hisfortune with a skin full of sore bones.i ii )PART III.7. Tom being now turned to his own./hifts, considers with himself how to raisen little more money; fo he gets a longfiring, as near as he could guefs to bethe length of his mother, and into Edin¬burgh he goes, to a wright who was ac¬quainted with his father and mother :The wright asked him how he did ? Heanfwered him tery foftly, he had lofta good dutiful mother last night, andthere’s a measure for her coffin. Tomwent out and ftaid for some time, andthen comes in again, and tells the wrighthe did not know what to do, for his fatherhad ordered him. to get money from fucka man whom he named, and he was thatday gone out of town : the wright askedhim how much he wanted ? To whichhe answered, A guinea and a half might do,or thirty {hillings at the least: So he gavehim ’’he guinea and the half: Then Tomgave him strict charges to be out on themorrow against eleven o^clock with thecoffin, and he should have his money alto¬gether Tom set out for the ale-house,with the money, and lived well whileit lafted. Next morning the wright andhis two lads went out with the coffin, and( 12 )as they wer \ going into the houfe, Tom’smother, {landing at the door, alked themafter how he did, and where he wasgoing with that fine coffin ? He did notknow well what to fay, being fo furprifedto fee her alive; but at laft he told her,her fon brought in the meafure the daybefore, and had got a guinea and a halffrom him, which he faid was to buy fomeother neceffaries for the funeral. O therogue ! faid {he, has he play‘d me that ?So the wright got his guinea and a half,and fo much for his trouble, and had totake back his coffin with him again.8. Tom being now ffiort of moneyagain, began to think how he could raifea freffi fupply ; fo he went to the portamongil the {hearers, and there he hiredabout thirty of them, and agreed to givethem a whole week‘s {hearing at ten-pence a-day, which was two pence higherthan any had got that year; this made*the poor (hearers think he was an honeft,generous, and genteel mailer as ever theygot, for he took them all into an ale-noufe, and gave them a hearty breakfaft,till they could eat no more Now, fays he,when there is fo many of you together,perhaps from different parts, and unac¬quainted with one-another, I do not knowC >3 >but there may be fome of you honefl meft,and fome of you rogues ; and as you areto lie all in one barn together, any of youwho has afty money, you‘11 be fureft togive it to me, and I‘ll mark it down inmy book with your names, and what Ireceive from each of you, and you fhallhave it all again on Saturdays night,when you get your wages. O! very well,goodman, take mine, take mine, everyone fader than another ; fome gave himfive, fix, feven, and eight {hillings, evenall they had earned throc the harved,which amounted to near feven poundsSterling. Having go: all their money,he goes on with them, till about threemiles out of the town, and coming toa great field of danding corn, tho‘ fome-what green, yet convenient for his pur-pofe, as it lay at fome didance from anyhoufe or perfon. So he made them beginthere, telling them he was going to orderdinner for them, and fend his own fer-vants to join them : Away he goes withall the fpeed he could, but takes anotherroad into the town, led they Ihould followand catch him. Now, when the peopleto whom the corn belonged, faw fucha band in their field, they could not un¬derhand the meaning of it; fo the farmer,whofe corn it was, went off, crying always;( 14 )as he ran,to them to flop ; but they woul4not, until he began to ftrike at them, andthey at him, he being in a great paflion,as the corn was not fully ripe; at last,by force of argument, and other peoplecoming up to his afliftance, the poorihearers were convinced they had gotthe bite, which caused them to go awaylamenting their misfortune.In two or three days thereafter, asTom was going down the Canongate,he meets one of his (hearers, who knewhim, and kept fast by him, demandinghis money, and fatisfaction for the reft:6 Whiftit, whifht,’ fays Tom,’ and you’llget yours and fomething else befide.’—So Tom takes him into the jail, and callsfor a bottle of ale and a dram ; then takesthe jailor afide, as if he had been goingto borrow the money from him, and saysto the jailor, ‘ Thrs man hear is a greatthief, I and two others have been in fearchof him thefe three davs, and the othertwo men have the warrant with them,fo if you keep this rogue here till T runand bring them, you (hall have a guineain reward * ‘ Yes,’ laid the jailor, ‘ go,and I’ll fix the rogue for you.’ So Tomgot clear off, leaving the poor innocent <fellow nnd the jailor ftruggling together,and then lets ojf for England directly.c t's yPART IV.9. Toni having now left his own nativecountry, went into the county of Nor¬thumberland, where he hired himfelfwith an old mifer of a farmer; and hepehe continued for feveral years, perform¬ing his duty in his service very well,tho* fometimes playing a roguish biteon thofe about him. His mailer hada very naughty cultom that he wouldallow them no candle at night to fee with,when at fupper : Tom one night fetshimfelf next to his master, and as theywere all about to fall on, Tom puts hisspoon into the heart of the dilh, wherethe crowdy was hotteft, and claps a fpoon-ful into his mailer’s mouth ; a pox on youfor a rogue, cried his mailer, for. mymouth is burnt! A pox - on you for amailer, fays Tom, for you keep a hoitfeas dark as Purgatory, for I was going tomy own mouth with that foup, and mifs’dthe way, it being fo dark; don’t think,mailer, that I am fuch a big fool as tofeed you, while I have a mouth of myown. So, from that night that Tom burnthis mailer's mouth with the hot crowdy,they always got a candle to Ihow themlight at fupper, for his mailer would feed»o more in the dark while Tom wasabout the houfe.19. There was a fervant girl in theforefaid houfe, who, always when /hemade the beds, negledecj to make Tom‘s,and would have him to do it himfelf—‘ Well then/ fays Tom, ‘ I have harderwork to do, and I /hall do that too/-—So next day, when Tom was in the fieldat the plough, when he faw his maftercoming from the houfe towards him, heleft the horfes and the plough /landing inthe field, and goes away towards hismafier, who cried, ‘ What is wrong? or,is any thing broke with you?’ ‘ ^o, no*fays Tom, but I’m going home to makemy bed, it has not been made thefe twoweeks, and ju/l now it is about the timethe maid makes all the reft, fo I‘ll gohome and make mine too.* No, no,ft)rah,* fays his mafter, ‘go back to yourplough, and 1 11 caufe it to be made everynight /or you. ‘ rlhen,’ fays Tom, ‘ Mlplow two or three furrows in the time.*11. There was a butcher came to hismafter's and bought a fine fat calf, foTom laid it on the horfe‘s neck, befcrethe butcher ; and when he was gone,‘ Now,* fays Tam, 4 what will you holdC 17 )master, but HI steal that calf from thebutcher before he goes two miles off?* Why,' says* his master, ‘ I'll hohl aguinea you don’t,' * Done,' says Tom.In he goes, and gets a good shoe of hismaster's, and runs another wav a-crossthe fields, until he got before the butcher,near the corner of a hedge, where therewas an open and turning of the way;here Tom darts himself behind the hedge,and throws the shoe in the middle of thehigh-way ; then up conies the butcher,riding, and his calf behind him : ‘ Hey,'said he to himself, ‘ there's a good shoe,if I knew how to get on my calf again,I would light for it: but what signifies onewithout its neighbour?’ So off he goes,and lets it ly. Tom then slips out, aadtakes up the shoe again, and runs crossthe fields, until he got in before thebutcher, at another open of ihe hedge,about half a mile distant, and there hethrows out the shoe again, on the middleof the road: then up comes the butcher,and seeing it, says to himselfi ‘ Now,I s all have a pair of good shoes for thelifting j and down he comes, lays the calfon the ground, and tying his horse to thehedge, runs back, thinking to get theother shoe, in which time, Tom whips upthe calf and shoe, and home he comes,( 18 )<lemanding his wager, which his mastercould not deny, being so fairly won.-—*The poor butcher returned back to hishorse, got only his travel for his pains;so missing his calf, he .knew not what tosay or do, but thinking it had broke therope from about his feet, and had runinto the fields, the butcher spent that dayin search of it amongst the hedges andditches, and returned to Tom’s master’sall night, intending to go and search far¬ther for it next day, giving them a tedi¬ous relation how he came to lose it bva cursed pair of shoes which he believedthe devil had dropped in his way ; and howhe had. taken the calf and all along withhim, expressing his thankfulness that thedevil was so honest as to spare his oldhorse, when he stole away Ins calf.Next morning Tom went to work, andmade a line white face on the calf withchalk and water ; then brings it out, andsells it to the butcher, which was gooddiversion to his master and other servants,to seethe butcher buv his own calf again.No sooner was he gone with it* then Tomsays, * Now, master, what will you holdbut I’ll steal it from him again, ere hegoes two miles off? ’No, no,’ says hismaster’ ‘ l‘11 hold no more bets with you,but I’ll give you a shiilling if you do it/C 19' * Done/ says Tom, * it will cost you nomore/ So away he runs a-foot thro’/the fields, until he came before the but¬cher, hard by the place where he stolethe calf from him the day before; andhere he lies behind the hedge, and asthe butcher came past, he put his handon his mouth, and cried Ba, baw, likea calf; The butcher hearing this, sworeto himself that there was the calf he hadlost the day jaefore ! Down he comes,and throws the calf on the ground, getsin thro’ the hedge in all haste, thinking■ he had no more to do but to take it up;but as he came in at one part of the hedge,Tom jumps out at another, and gets the, calf on his back ; he then gets in overthe hedge on the other side, and thro’the fields he came safely home, with thecalf on his back ; while the poor butcherspent his time and iabou:’ in vain, run-J nine; from hedge to hedge, and hole to1 hole, seeking what was not there to be' found. So the butcher returned to hishorse again, and finding his other calfgone, he concluded it to be done by someinvisible spirit about that spot of ground ;and so went home and raised a bad reporton the devil, saying, That he was turneda highwayman, and had taken two calvesfrom him. So Tom washing the wfoiteA.( 20 )face of the stolen calf, his master sentthe butcher word to come and buy ano¬ther calf; which he accordingly did a fewdays after, and Tom sold him the samecalf the third time; then told him thewhole affair as it was acted, giving himhis money again. So the butcher gotbut fun for his trouble.PARTY.12. There was an old rich blindwoman, who lived hard by, that hada young girl, her only daughter, and shefell deep in love with Tom, and "l orn fellas deep in love with the money, but notwith the maid; the old woman bestoweda vast of presents on Tom, and mountedbun like a gentleman, but still he put offthe marriage from time to time, and al¬ways wanted something, which the old;woman gave the money to purchase forhim, until he had got about thirty posndsof her money, and then she would delaythe marriage no longer; Tom went andtook the old woman and the girl aside,ami made his apology as follows ; * Dearmother, said he, I am very willing to wedwith my dear Polly, for she appears aeii -2 i')an angel ia mine eyes; but I am lorry,very forry to acquaint you that I am nota fit match for her, ‘What, child,’ saysthe old woman, there’s not a fitter matchin the world for my Polly : I did not thinkyour country could afford fuch a cleveryouth as what I hear of you to be •, youihall neither want gold nor filver, nor yeta good horse to ride upon, and when I dieyou fhall have my all.’ ‘ O but,* faysTom, ‘ mother, that’s not the matter atall, the flop is this, when I was at homein Scotland, I got a flroke with a horfe'Sfoot on the bottom of my belly, which hasfo quite difabled me below, that I cannotperform a husband’s duty in bed.’ Theold woman hearing this clapped her hands,and fell a-crying, ‘ O ! if it had been anyimpediment but that, but that, but thatwofuc that! which, gold nor filver cannotpurchafe, and yet the poorefl people, evencommon beggars, have plenty of it.’—The old woman and her daughter fatcrying and wringing their hands, andTom flood and wept left he fhould getno more Kioney. ‘ O, mother,’ faysPolly,' ‘ HI wed with him neverthelefs,I love him fo dearly! ‘ No, no, youfoolifh girl, would you throw yourfelfaway, to marry a man and die a maid!you don't know the end of your creationb(22)it is the enjoyment of a man in bed, thatmakes women to marry, which is a plea-fure like Paradife ; and if you wed withthis man, you’ll live and die and neverknow it,’ * Hoo, hoo,’ fays Tom, ‘ if Ihad got money, I needed not been thisway till now, 4 money, you fool,’ faidthe old woman, 4 there’s not fuch a thingto be got for money in all England/—4 Ay,’ lays Tom, / there’s a doctor inNewcaftle, will make me as able as anyother man for ten guineas’ 4 Ten gui¬neas !’ faid ftie 44 I’ll give him 50 guineasif he will; but here is twelve, and go tohim directly, and know firft what hecan do, and come again and wed mychild, or Ihe and I will foon die both forthy sake.* Tom having now got twelveguineas more of their money, preparedfor his journey, aud early next morningfet out for Newcaftle ; but in^ead of go¬ing to Newcaftie; he came to old bcot-land, and left Polly and her mother tothink upon him. In about two weeksafter, when he was not like to return,nor fo much as to fend them, any word,the old woman and Polly got a horse,and came to Newcaftle in fearch of him,and went through all the Doctors4 fhops,alking if there came a young man thereabout two weeks ago, with a broken —( 23 )to mend ? Some laughed at them, others.were like to kick them out oi doors, andfo they had to return without Setting anyaccount of him.PART VI.I| 15 Now, after Tom’s return to Scot¬land, he got a wife, and took a little farmnear Dalkeith, and became a very doufeman for many days, following his oldbufinefs the cowping of horses and cows,feeding of veals for flaughter, and the like.I So one day he went to a fair, and boughta a fine cow from an old woman, but Tomi judged by the lownefs of the price thatthe cow certainly had fome fault: Tomj gives the wife the other hearty bicker of. ale, then fays he, 4 Gudewife, the moneyns yours, and the cow is mine, ye maun1 tell me ony wee bits of hurts that fhe has.’4 Indeed,’ quo4 the wife 4 fhe has nae.afaut but ane, and if she had wanted it,I wad never a parted wi4 her.’ 4 And'what’s that, Gudewufe ?’ faid he. 4 Indeed,*ifaid fhe, 4 the filthy daft beafl fucks ayihersel' 4 Hute,’ fays Tom, 4 if that be all,I’lhfoon cure her of that, eO! can yeI do that?* faid the wife; if l h%d kend whathad a don’t, ye wadna gotten her/—* A-well/ fays Tom, ‘ Til tell you whatto do: Tak the cow’s price, I gave yoajuft now, and tye it hard and faft in yournapkin, and give it to me thro’ beneaththe cow’s wame, and I’ll give you thenapkin again over the cow’s back, andTil lay my life for it, that Ihe 11 never Ifuck herfel in my aught, e I wat well/faid Ihe, 4 Tfe do that, an4 there fhou’d |be witchcraft in’t, So Tom no foonergot it thro’ below the cow’s wame, thanhe loofes out the money and puts it inhis pocket, and gave the wife again hernapkin over the cow’s back, accordinglyas he told her, faying 4 Now, wife, you |have your cow, and I my money, andlhe’11 never fuck hcrftl in my aught, asI told you, 4 O dole !’ cried the wife,4 is that your cure ? ye’ve cheated me,ye’ve cheated me?’FINIS.J.

Holiday ' >ids Labour play,An’ failin’health recruit,Yet need a body lat the toldyMak the man a brute PLet Labour’s shanks leave shafts an’ ranks,An’ roam by mount or main;But shun the dens where

joy;But bivthely sing their jingo-ring,Nor blush to be a bey 1Or lat them rove thro’ leafy grove,An’ hear the cushie coo;Or playfu’ lave in sparkling wave,An’ dip like snowy mew;Then sheilies fair an’

RINDERPEST.Tune—“ Scots, Wha Hae"Stots, by fanners purely bred,Stots, whase sires hae freely bled,Must we stamp your gory bed PNor find a remedy PStots, that droop the ruefu’ head,Stots, on which John Bull is fed,Say you’ll gang, but won’t be spedIn Railway truckery,If you held your Highlan’ way,Snoov’d alang frae brae to brae ,Cauler streams would thirst allay,An’ cool your burnin’ e’e.That your flesh and fat may thrive,Let the drover gently driveWhere the road will yield a riveO’ nature’s greenery.Stots, aft crowded head and tail,Swiftly whirled on rattling rail,Where nor grass nor water-pailRelieves your misery;By your pest and by your pains.By your trucks wi’ filthy stains,By your steam-bewilder’d brains,Loud bellow—you’ll be free!6When the gloatain 'c ifns to daw,Seek repose in grassy park,Hast will fit you for the wavkO’ neist (.ay’s trudgery.Farmers, does the Holy BookWeekly rest for beasts o’erlook PBrave ye still the frowning lookThat blights your property ?Since His judgments are abroad,Oh, submissive hear the rod;Grace for oxen green:- the sod,An’ decks- the gowany lea jThen your Sunday tracks tak’ an,Worship not the golc en calf,Turn, oh turn, from mammon’s laughTo deep humility.THE CLEAR, COOLING WAVE.Tune-*-" The Scottish Blue Bells."Let the vot’ry of Bacchus exult o’er his barrels,And boast of his freedom while appetite’s slave;We leave him the hotbed of bloodshed and quarrels,And sing the pure fount with the clear, cooling wave.Spring up lovely fountain, beneath the gray willow,While flowers in thy waters their loveliness lave,And roll thro’ the valley thy far-cheering billow,While fields, flocks, and- iveehabites hail thy clear wave.Chor.—Then loud raise your voices in sweet swellingnumbers,And boldly the taunt of the Bacchanal brave;Till echo reply from the cave of her slumbers,The green-margin’d fount with the clear,cooling wave!7When thro' the parch’d wilderness Israel were straying,And o’er them as brass blaz’d the cloudless concave,The rod-smitten Horeb, the signal obeying,Pour’d forth from her bosom the clear, cooling wave.When far on his journey the Prophet had sped him,His life from the hand of oppression to save,By ravens the bounty of Providence fed him,But left him to drink of the clear, cooling wave.Chor.—Then loud raise your voices in sweet swellingnumbers, &c,To his cot, when the toil-wearied father has plodded,His child brings a draught from the cool, dripping cave;Tho’ drink may force laughter from hearts care-corroded,Yet happiness beams o’er the clear, cooling wave!0 Folly ungrateful, why rifle the vallevs,And torture &r drink wha1 for/bocTlVIercy gave?Wi de Wisdom, to famish a health-flowing chalice,Bi-'hs thro’ the fountain the clear, cooling wave.C/W.—Yhen loud raise your voices in sweet swellingnumbers, &c.SANG O’ THE UNEMPLOYED.Tune—“ Boh and Joan."■ »i ’ . . i J i ’ l ■I haedna nae employThro’ a’ this wintry wather;The meelocks I enjoyWi’ muckle shame I gather.I lang had rowth o’ wark.An’ couldna fart the wages,Wi’ hail coat an’ clean sark,I sang like birds in cages.But aye fan Feemlay cam,I coulda pass the Public;My joy—&pipe ai ’ dram,Wi’ chiels that 1 eld a club-like.8My wife right cauldrife steed.An’ listen’d at the shutter ;The bairns aye girn’d for bread—They kentna fat was butter.An’ there I roar’d a sang,Tho’ ebbin’ fast my pocket,Syne i’ the strynd ere langMy siller’s worth I byockit!An’ gin I fan my wifeAside the Public stanin’,Gin sclafferts was nae rife,Shfe had her share o’ bannin’.The coppers that she gotWas but the Public’s leavins;Had I nae been a sot,I mith ’a had some Savins.But now I’m out o’ warb,Wi’ credit a sad lack o’,Pat sud hae fill’d my ark,Was war’d on drink an’ ’bacco.Then shut ilk Public House,Frae Causey-En’ to Puttie;Let Indignation looseTo crush baith stoup an’ cuttie.Sae prays my “ achin’ void,”—Foul fa’ tobacco-spinners jSoon ’mo the Unemploy’dBe Publicans an’ Sinners!

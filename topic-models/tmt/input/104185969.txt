SWEET HOME.Mid pleasures ami palaces though we may roam,ie it ever so humble, there’s no place like home,I charm from the sky seems to hallow us there,which seek through the world is ne’er met with else¬where.Home, home, sweet, sweet home.,I There’s no place like home, there’s no place lik<home.In exile from home, splendour dazzles in vain,h, give me my lowly thatch’d cottage again ;he birds singing gaily, that came at my call,ivc me them, with the peace of mind dearer than all.Home, home, sweet, sweet home,There’s no place like home, there’s no place likehome.COMING. THROUGH THE RYE.If a body meet a body cornin’ through the rye,If a body meet a body, need a body cry?Every lassie has her laddie,Nane, they say, hae I;Yet a’ the lads they smile at me,When cornin’ through the rye.Amang the train there is a swainI dearly lo’e mysel’;But whare his hame, or what his name,I dinna care to tell.6It' a body meet a body comiti’ frae the touu,11 a body greet a body, need a body frown ?Every lassie has her laddie,Nane, they say, hae I;Yet a’ the lads they smile at meWhen cornin’ through the rye.Amang the train there is a swainI dearly lo’e mysel’;But whare his hame, or what his name,I dinna care to tell.GLOOMY WINTER’S NOW AW A,Gloomy winter’s now awa,Saft the westlin breezes blaw,’Mang the birks o’ Stanely shaw.The mavis sings fu’ cheery, O.Sweet the crawflowers early bellDecks Glenilfer’s dewy dell.Blooming like thy bonny sel’,My young, my artless dearie, 0.(Jome, my lassie, let us goO’er Glenkilloch’s sunny brae,Blythely spend the gowden day.Midst joys that never weary, 0.Tow ring o’er the Newton woods,Lav’rocks fawn the snaw-white clouds,Siller saughs, wi’ downy buds,Adorn the banks sae briery, 0.7Round the sylvan fairy nooks.Feather’d breckans fringe the rocks,’Neath the brae the burnie jouks,And ilka thing is cheery, O.Trees may bud, and birds may sing,Flowers may bloom, and verdure spring,Joy to me they canna bring.Unless wi’ thee, my dearie, O.i  k . r i.MY HEART AND LUTE.I give thee all, I can no more,Though poor the offring be ;My heart and lute are all the storeThat I can bring to thee.A lute whose gentle soul revealsThe soul of love full well;And, better far, a heart that feelsMuch more than lute can tell.I give thee all, &c.Though love and song may fail, alas!To keep life’s clouds away,At least ’twill make them lighter pa-s.Or gild them if they stay.If ever care his discord flingsO’er life’s enchanted strain,Let love but gently touch the strings,Twill all be sweet again.I give thee all, &c.8ALL THAT’S BRIGHT MUST FADE.All that’s bright must fade.The brightest still the fleetest,All that’s sweet was madeBut to be lost when sweetest!Stars that shine and fall,The flower that droops in springing.These, alas ! are types of allTo which our hearts are clinging.Who would seek or prizeDelights that end in aching ?Who would trust to tiesThat every hour are breaking ?Better far to beIn utter darkness lying,Than blest with light, and seeThat light for ever flying'.MY ANNA’S URN.Encompass’d in an angel’s frame,An angel’s virtues lay,Too soon did heav’n assert the claim,And call’d its own away.My Anna’s worth, my Anna’s charmsMust never more return ;What-now shall fill these widow'd arm - ?Ah me! my Anna’s urn.

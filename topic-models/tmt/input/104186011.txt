■ .I,iO£ A I : ,.!!■ AilR. t, *, ,1ATHE*.IFE AND ADVENTURESOFPETER WILLIAMSON.1 Was born in the parish of Aboyne, Aberdeenj Shire, of respectable parents, who sent me veryearly to live with an aunt at Aberdeen ; when,under the years of pupillarity, one playing onthe quay with others of my companions—beingot a stout robust constitution—I was taken noticeof by two fellows belonging to a vessel in theharbour, employed, in the trade called kidnap,ring; that is stealing young children from theirnirents, and selling them as slaves in plantationsibroad. Being market out by those monsters ofmpiety as their prey, I was cajoled on board thehip by them, where I was no sooner got, thanI hey conducted me between the decks to somerthers they had kidnapped in the same manner.\t that time, I had no sense of the fate that wasiestined for me, arid spent the time in childish4amusements with my fellow-sufferers in the steer¬age, being never suffered to go upon deck whilstthe vessel lay in the harbour.In about a month’s time the ship set sail forAmerica. I cannot forget that, when we arrivedon the coast we w’ere destined for, a hard gale ofwind sprung up from the S. E. and, to the cap¬tain’s great surprise (he not thinking he was nearland, although having been 11 weeks on the pass¬age), about twelve o’clock at night, the shipstruck on a sand bank off Cape May, near theCapes of Delaware, and, to the great terror andaffright of the ship’s company, in a short timewas almost full of water. The boat was thenhoisted out, into which the captain and his fel¬low villians, the crew, got with some difficulty,leaving me and my deluded companions to perish,as they then naturally concluded inevitable deathto be our fate. Often, in my distresses andmiseries since, have I wished that such had beenthe consequence, when in a state of innocence !But Providence thought proper to reserve mefor future trials of its goodness. Thus abandonedand deserted, without the least prospect of relief,but threatened every moment with death, diethese villians leave us. The cries, the shrieks,and tears of a parcel of infants, had no effect on,or caused the least remorse in the breasts of the amerciless wretches. Scarce can I say to whic.i5; to g'Lve tne preference, whether to such as these,i who have had the opportunity of knowing the] Christian religion ; or to the savages herein afterj described, who profane not the gospel, or boast' of humanity ; and if they act in a more brutal andl butcherly manner, yet it is to their enemies, for; the sake of plunder and the rewards offered them|l for their principles are alike—the love of sordidj| gain being both their motives. The ship beingi on a sand bank, which did not give way to let| her deeper, we lay in the same deplorable condi-Stion until morning, when, though we saw theland of Cape May, at about a mile’s distance, weknew not what would be our fate.The wind at length abated, and the captain,unwilling to lose all her cargo, about ten o’clock,sent some of his crew in a boat to the ship’s sideto bring us on shore, where we lay in a sort of acamp, made of the sails of the vessel, and suchother things as we could get. The provisionslasted us until we were taken in by a vessel boundto Philadelphia, lying on this island, as* well asI can recollect, near three weeks. Very littleof the cargo was saved undamaged, and the ves-Bsel was entirely lost.When arrived and landed at Philadelphia, thecapital of Pennsylvania, the captain had peopleenough who came to buy us. He, sold us atabout £1G per head. What became of my un*6happy companions, I never knew; it was my iotto be sold to one of my countrymen, whose namewas Hugh Wilson, a North Britain, who had inhis youth undergone the same fate as myself—having been kidnapped from St. Johnstown, inScotland.Happy was my lot in falling into my country¬man’s power, as he was, contrary to many othersof his calling, a humane, worthy, honest man.Having no children of his own, and commiser¬ating my unhappy condition, he took great careof me until I was fit for business, and, about the12th year of my age, set me about little trifles;in which state I continued until my 14th year,when I was more fit for harder work. Duringsuch my idle state, seeing my fellow-servants of¬ten reading and writing, it incited in me an in¬clination to learn, which I intimated to my mas¬ter, tellino* him I should be very willintr to servea year longer than the contract by which I wassold, if he would indulge me in going to school;this he readily agreed to, saying that winter wouldbe the best time. It being then summer, Iwaited with impatience for the other season ; but,to make some progress in my design, I got aPrimer, and learned as much from my fellow-servants as I could. At school, where I wentevery winter for five years, I made a tolerableproficiency, and have ever since been improving7myself at leisure hours. With this good master* continued till I was seventeen years old, whenhe died ; and, as a reward for my faithful service,he left me £200 ourrency, which was then about£150 sterling, his best horse, saddle, and all hiswearing apparel.Being now my own master, having money inmy pocket, and all other necessaries, I employedmyself in jobbing about the country, working forany one that would employ me, for near sevenyears, when, thinking I had money sufficient tofollow some better way of life, I resolved to set¬tle, but thought one step necessary thereto wasto be married; for which purpose I applied tothe daughter of a substantial planter, and foundmy suit was not unacceptable to her or her father,so that matters were soon concluded upon, andwe married. My father-in-law, in order to es¬tablish us in the world in an easy, if not affluentmanner, made me a deed of gift of a tract of land,that lay, unhappily for me, as it has since proved,on the frontiers of the province of Pennsylvania,near the forks of Delaware, in Berks County,'lontaining about 200 acres ; 30 of which werewell cleared, and lit for immediate use, whereonwas a good house and barn. The place pleasingme well, I settled on it, though it cost me themajor part of my money in buying stock, house¬hold furniture, and implements for out-door work ;anti happy as I was in a good wife, yet did myfelicity last me not long; for about the year 1754,the Indians in the French Interest, who had fora long time before ravaged and destroyed otherparts of America unmolested, I may very proper¬ly says began to be very troublesome on thefrontiers of our province, where they generallyappeared in small skulking parties, with yellings,shoutings, and antic postures, instead of trumpetsand drums, committing great devastations. ThePennsylvanians little imagined at first that theIndians, guilty of such outrages and violence,were some of those who pretended to be in theEnglish interest; which, alas! proved to be tootrue to many of us ; for, like the French in Eu¬rope, without regard to faith or treaties, theysuddenly break out into furious, rapid outrages,and devastations, but soon retire precipitatelyhaving no stores nor provisions but what theymeet with in their incursions. Some indeedcarry a bag with biscuit or Indian corn therein,but not unless they have a long march to theirdestined place of action. And those French whowere sent to dispossess us in that part of theWorld, being indefatigable in their duty, and con¬tinually contriving and using all manner of waysand means to win the Indians to their interest,many of whom had been too negligent, and some¬times, I may say, cruelly treated by those who9pretend to be their protectors and friends, foundit no very difficult matter to get over to theirinterest many who belonged to those nations inamity with us, especially as the rewards theygave them were so great, they paying for everyscalp of an English person £15 sterling.Shocking to human nature were the barbari¬ties daily committed by the savages, and are notto be paralleled in ail the volumes of history !Scarce did a dpy pass but some unhappy familyor other fell victims to savage cruelty. Terribleindeed it proved to me, as well as to many others;I that was now happy in an easy state of life,blessed with an affectionate and tender wife, whowas possessed of all amiable qualities, to enableme to go through the world with that peace andserenity of mind which every Christian wishes topossess, became on a sudden one of the most un¬happy and deplorable of mankind. Scarce canI sustain the shock which for ever recoils on me,at thinking on the last time of seeing that goodwoman. The fatal 2d of October, 1754, shethat day went from home to visit some of her re¬lations. As I staid up later than usual, expect¬ing her return, none being in the house besidesmyself, how great was my surprise, terror, andaffright, when, about 11 o’clock at night, I heardthe dismal war-cry, or war-whoop of the savages,and to my inexpressible grief, soon found my10house was attacted by them. I flew to my cham¬ber window, and perceived them to be twelve innumber. They making1 several attempts to getin, I asked them what they wanted. They gaveme no answer, but continued beating, and Irv¬ing to get the door opened. Judge, then, thecondition I must be in, knowing the cruelty anamerciless disposition of those savages, should 1fall into their hands. To escape which dreadfulmisfortune, having my gun loaded in my hand,I threatened them with death if they should notdesist. But how vain and fruitless are the effortsof one man against the united force of so many,and of such merciless, undaunted, and blood-J.irsty monsters as I had here to deal with. Oneof them that could speak a little English, threat¬ened me in return, that, if I did not come out,they would burn me alive in the house—tellingme farther, that they were no friends to the Eng¬lish ; but if I would come out and surrender my¬self prisoner, they would not kill me. My ter¬ror and distraction at hearing this is not to heexpressed by words, nor easily imagined by anyperson, unless in the same condition. Littlecould ^ depend on the promises of such creature:.and yet, if 1 did not, inevitable death, by beingburnt alive, must me my lot. Distracted as Jwas, in such deplorable circumstances, 1 chose torely on the uncertainty of their fallacious promis-re-11es, rather than meet with certain death, byjecting them ; and, accordingly, went out of my; house with my gun in my hand, not knowingwhat I did, or that I had it. Immediately onmy approach, they rushed on me like so manyI tigers, and instantly disarmed me. Having mof thus in their power, the merciless villians boundi me to a tree near the door; they then went intoI the house, and plundered and destroyed everyjj thing, carrying off what moveables they could;j! the rest, together with the house, they set firef to, and consumed before my eyes. The barbar-lij bins, not satisfied with this, set fire to my barn,|| stable, and out-houses, wherein were about 200!; bushels of wheat, six cows, four horses, and fivejij sheep, which were entirely consumed to ashes.| During the conflagration to describe the thoughts,| the fears, and misery that I felt, is utterly iin-| possible, after this, they untied me, and gave meIk a great loud to carry on my back, under which II travelled all that night with them, full of theI most terrible apprehensions, and oppressed with1 the greatest anxiety of mind, lest my unhappyi wife should likewise have fallen a prey to thoseJj cruel monsters. At day-break, my infernal mas-ji ters ordered me to lay down my load, when, tie-(i ing my hands again round a tree with a smallli cord, they then forced the blood out of my fin-jj ger-ends. They then kindled a fire near the12tree whereto I was bound, which filled me withdreadful agonies, concludinof I was sroinfif to bemade a sacrifice to their barbarity.The fire being thus made, they for some timedanced round me after their manner, with vari¬ous odd motions and antic gestures, whooping, |jhalioeing, and crying in a frightful manner, asit is their custom. Having satisfied themselvesin this sort of their mirth, they proceeded in amore tragdcal manner, taking the burning: coalsand sticks, flaming with fire at the ends, holdingthem near my face, head, hands, and feet, witha deal of monstrous pleasure and satisfaction, andut she same time threatening to burn me entire¬ly if I made the least noise or motion of my body.Thus tortured, as I was, almost to death, Isufi’ered their brutal pleasure without being al¬lowed to vent my inexpressible anguish otherwisethan by shedding tears; even which, when theseinhuman tormentors observed, with a shocking-pleasure and alacrity, they would take fresh coalsand apply near my eyes, telling me my face waswet, and that they would dry it for me. How 1suffered these tortures, I have here faintly des¬cribed, has been matter of wonder to me manytimes; but God enabled me to wait with morethan common patience for a deliverance I dailyprayed for.Having at length satisfied their brutal pleasure,they sat round the fire and roasted their meat ofwhich they had robbed my dwelling. Whenthey had prepared it, and satisfied their voraciousappetites, they oftered some to me; though it iseasily imagined I had but little appetite to eat,after the tortures and miseries I had undergone,yet was I forced to seem pleased with what theyoffered me, lest, by refusing it, they had againresumed their hellish practices. What 1 couldnot eat, I contrived to get between the bark andthe tree where I was fixed, they having unboundmy hands until they imagined I had eat all theygave me; but then they again bound me as be¬fore, in which deplorable condition was I forcedto continue all that day. When the sun was set,they put out the fire, and covered the ashes withleaves, as is their usual custom, that the whitepeople might not discover any traces or signs oftheir having been there.Going from thence along by the river, for thespace of six miles, loaded as I was before, we ar¬rived at a spot near the Apalachian mountains,where they hid their plunder under logs of wood ,and Oh, shocking to relate 1 from thence did thesehellish monsters proceed to a neighbouring house,occupied by one Joseph Snider and his unhappyfamily, consisting of his wife, five children, anda young man, his servant. They soon got ad¬mittance into the unfortunate man's house, where14toey immediately, without the least remorse, andwith more than brutal cruelty, scalped the ten¬der parents and the unhappy children; nor couldthe tears, the shrieks, or cries of these unhappyvictims prevent their horrid massacre ; for havingthus scalped them, and plundered the house ofevery thing that was moveable, they set fire tothe same, where the poor creatures met theirfinal doom amidst the flames, the hellish mis¬creants standing at the door, or as near the houseas the flames would permit them, rejoicing andechoing back, in their diabolical manner, thepiercing cries, heart-rending groans, and pater¬nal and affectionate soothings, which issued fromthis most horrid sacrifice of an innocent family,not contented with what they had already done,they still continued their inordinate villiany, inmaking a general conflagration of the barn andstables, together with all the corn, horses, cows,and every thing on the place.Thinking the young man belonging to thisunhappy family would be of some service to themin carrying part of their plunder, they spared hislife, and loaded him and myself with what theyhad here got, and again marched to the BlueHills, where they stowed their goods as before.My fellow-sufferer could not long bear the crueltreatment which we were both obliged to suffer,and complaining bitterly to me of being unableto proceed any farther, I endeavoured to condolehim as much as lay in my power, to bear up un¬der his afflictions, and wait with patience till, bythe divine assistance, we should be delivered outof their clutches; but in vain, for he still contin¬ued his moans and tears, which one of the sava¬ges perceiving as we travelled on, instantly cameup to us, and with his tomahawk gave him ablow on the head, which felled the unhappy youthto the ground, where they immediately scalpedand left him. The suddenness of this murdershocked me to that degree, that I was in a man-jllner like a statue, being quite motionless, expect¬ing my fate would soon be the same; however,recovering my distracted thoughts, I dissembledthe uneasiness and anguish which I felt, as wellas I could, from the barbarians; but such wasIthe terror that I was under, that for some time IIscarce knew the days of the week, or what I did,I so that, at this period, life indeed became a bur¬den to me, and I regretted being saved from myirst persecutors, the Sailors.The horrid fact being completed, they kept on:heir course near the mountains, where they lay;culking four or five days, rejoicing at the plumjler and store they had got. When provisions>ecame scarce, they made their way towardssusquehana, where still, to add to the many bar-jarities they had already committed, passing neari1Ganother house inhabited by an unhappy old man,whose name was John Adams, with his wife andfour small children ; and, meeting’ with no resist¬ance, they immediately scalped the unhappy wifeand her four children, before the good old man’styes. Inhuman and horrid as this rvas, it didnot satiate them, for when they had murderedthe poor woman, they acted with her in such abrutal manner, as descency, or the remembranceof the crime, will not permit me to mention, andthis even before the unhappy husband, who not,being able to avoid the sight, and incapable ofaffordina' her the least relief, entreated them toput an end to his miserable being ; but they wereas deaf and regardless to the tears, prayers, andentreaties of this venerable sufferer, as they hadbeen to those of the others, and proceeded in theirhellish purpose of burning and destroying hisbouse, barn, cattle, hay, corn, and every thingthe poor man a few hours before was master of.Having saved what they thought proper from theflames, they gave the old man, feeble, weak, andin the miserable condition he then was, as wellas myself, burdens to carry, and loading them¬selves likewise with bread and meat, pursuedtheir journey on towards the Great Swamp,where, being arrived, they lay for eight or nine idays, sometimes diverting themselves in exercis- sing the most atrocious and barbarous cruelties on i1 i,heir unhappy victim, the old man; sometimeshey would strip him naked, and paint him all)ver with various sorts of colours, which theyxtracted, or made from herbs and roots ; at otherlimes, they would pluck the white hairs from hisenerable beard, and tauntingly tell him, he wasI fool for living so long, and that they would|: hew him kindness in putting him out of the/ovld ; to all which the poor creature could butjent his sighs, his tears, his moans, and entreaties,at, to my affrighted imagination, were enoughpenetrate a heart of adamant, and soften theost obdurate savage. In vain, alas! were allis tears, for daily did they tire themselves withe various means they tried to torment him—metimes tying him to a tree, and whippingat others, scorching his furrowed cheeksith red-hot coals, and burning his legs, quite toc knees; but the good old man, i nstead of re-ning, or wickedly arraigning the divine justice,e many others in such cases, even in the great¬ly agonies, incessantly offered up his prayers toAlmighty, with the most fervent thanksgiv-1 > s for his former mercies, and hoping the flames,m surrounding and burn in a; hisunding and burning his aged limbs,uld soon send him to the blessful mansions ofjust, to be a partaker of the blessings there.Bid during such his pious ejaculations, his m-Jnal plages would come round him, mimicking-18'.ms !ieart-rendin^ groans and piteous wailingsOne nigflit afteiv he had thus been tormentedvhilst he and I were sitting together, condolingeach other at the misfortunes and miseries wJdaily suffered, twenty scalps and three prisonenfiwere brought in by another party of IndiansThey had unhappily fallen in their hands irCannojigge, a small town near the river Susque-hana, chiefly inhabited by the Irish. Thesfprisoners gave us some shocking accounts of themurders and devastations committed in their parts.The various and complicated actions of these bar¬barians would entirely fill a large volume; butwhat I have already written, with a few otheiinstances which I shall select from the informa¬tion, will enable the reader to guess at the horrirtreatment the English, and Indians in their in¬terest, suffered for many years past. I shalltherefore only mention, in a brief manner, thosethat suffered near the same time with myselffThis party who now joined us, had it not, I!found, in their power to begin their wiekedne-sas soon as those who visited my habitation, the tafirst of their tragedies being on the 25th day oftOctober, 1754, when John Lewis, with his wife rand three small children, fell sacrifices to their,cruelty, and were miserably scalped and mur- t,dered, his house, barn, and every thing he pos- tsessed being burnt and destroyed. On the 28th, ^19Jacob Miller, with his wife and six of his family,together with every thing on his plantation, un¬derwent the game fate. The 30th, the house,mill, barn, twenty head of cattle, two teams ofhorses, and etery thing' belonging to the unhap¬py George Folke, met with the like treatment—himself, wife, and all his miserable family, con--sisting of nine in number, being inhumanly scal¬ped, then cut in pieces and given to the swine,which devoured them. I shall give another in-j stance of the numberless and unheard of barbar-Iities they related of the savages, and proceed totheir own tragical end. In short, one of the sub-I stantial traders belonging to the province, havingbusiness that called him some miles up the coun¬try, fell into the hands of these devils, who notonly scalped him, but immediately roasted himli before he was dead ; then, like cannibals for want!of other food, eat his whole body, and of his headmade what they called an Indian pudding.S From these few' instances of savage cruelty,the deplorable situation of the defenceless inhabi-ii tants, and what they hourly suffered in that part< of the globe, must strike the utmost terror to af human soul, and cause in every breast the utmostI detestation, nor only against the authors of sucht. tragic scenes, but against those who, throughii perfidy, inattention, or pusillanimous and errone-m oub principles, suffered these savages at first, un-repelled, or even unmolested, to commit suchoutrages and incredible depradations and mur¬ders ; for no torments, no barbarities that can beexercised on the human sacrifices they get intotheir power, arc left untried or omitted.The three prisoners that were brought withthese additional forces, constantly repining attheir lot, and almost dead with their excessive,hard treatment, contrived at last to make their; but being far from their own settlements,and not knowing the country, were soon aftermet by some others of the tribes or nations atwar with us, and brought back to their diaboli¬cal masters, who greatly rejoiced at having themagain in their infernal power. The poor crea¬tures, almost famished for want of sustenance,having bad none during the time of their elope¬ment, were no sooner in the clutches of the bar¬barians, than two of them were tied to a tree,and a great fire made round them, where they re¬mained till they were terribly scorched and burnt,when one of the villians, with his scalping knife,ripe open their bellies, took out their entrails,and burnt them before their eyes, whilst theothers were cutting, piercing, and tearing theflesh from their breasts, hands, arms, and legs,with red-hot irons, till they were dead. Thethird unhappy victim was reserved a few hourslonger, to be, if possible, sacrificed in a more21cruel manner—his arms were tied close to hiabody, and a hole being dug deep enough for himto stand upright, he was put therein, and earthI rammed and beat in all round his body, up to theneck, so that his head only appeared above theground; they then scalped him, and there lethim remain for three or four hours in the great-i est agonies; after which they made a small lirei near his head, causing him to suffer the most ex¬cruciating torments imaginable, whilst the poorI creature could only cry for mercy in killing trimI 1 immediately, for his brains were boiling in hishead. Inexorable to alibis plaints, they contin¬ued the fire, whilst, shocking to behold, his eyesgushed out of their sockets ; and such agonizingtorments did the unhappy creature suffer for neartwo hours till he was quite dead! They thencut off his head and buried it with the otherbodies—my task being to dig the graves, which,feeble and terrified as I was, the dread of suffer¬ing the same fate, enabled me to do. I shallnot here take up the reader’s time, in vainly at-i tempting to describe what I felt on such an oc-sl casion, but continue my narrative, as more equal3 to my abilities.A great snow now falling, the barbarians werQi a little fearful lest the white people should, by| their traces, find out their skulking retreats,li which obliged them to make the best ot tneir22way to their winter quarters, about two hundredmiles farther from any plantation or inhabitants,where, after a long and tedious journey, beingalmost starved, I arrived with this infernal crew.The place where wc were to rest, in their tongueis called Alamingo. There were found a num¬ber of wigwams full of their women and children.Dancing, shooting, and shouting, were their gen¬eral amusements ; and in all their festivals andlances they relate what successes they have had,and what damages they have sustained in theirexpeditions, in which I became part of theirtheme. The severity of the cold increasing, thevstript me of my clothes, for their own use, andgave me such as they usually wore themselves,being a piece of blanket, a pair of mogganes, orshoes, with a yard of coarse cloth to put roundme instead of breeches. To describe their dressand manner of living mav not be altogether un-acceptable to some of my readers; but, as the isize of this book will not permit me to be so par- ilticular as I might otherwise be, I shall just ob- -serve, that they, in general, wear a white blank; t, which in war-time they paint with varioufigures, but particularly the leaves of trees, in or¬der lo deceive their enemies, when in the woodsTheir mogganes are made of deer-skins, and thebest sort have them bound round the edges %vithlittle beads and ribbands. On their legs thevi23wear pieces of blue cloth for stockings, some likeour soldiers’ splatter-dashes. They reach high¬er than their knees, but not lower than their an¬cles. They esteem them easy to run in. Breechesthey never wear, but instead thereof two piecesof linen, one before and another behind. Thebetter sort have shirts of the finest linen they canget, and to these some wear ruffles ; but thesethey never put on till they have painted them oivarious colours, which they get from the peconeroot and bark of trees, and never pull them onto wash, but wear them till they fall to pieces.They are very proud, and take great delight inearing trinkets, such as silver plates, round theirrists and necks, with several strings of wampum,hich is made of cotton, interwoven with peb-les, cockleshells, &c. down to their breasts, androm their ears and noses they have rings or beadshich hand dangling an inch or two. The menve no beards, to prevent which they use cer-in instruments and tricks as soon it begins torow. The hair of their heads is managed dif-rently; some pluck out and destroy all, exe p:lock hanging from the crown of the head, whirey interweave with wampum and feathers otarious colours. The women wear it very long,wisted down their backs with beads, feathers,,nd wampum, and on their heads most of themr’ear little c ronets of brass or coppar ; round24their middle they wear a uiaoket instead of apetticoat. The females are very chaste and con¬stant to their husbands; and if any young maidenshould happen to have a child before marriage,she is never esteemed afterwards. As for theirfood, they get it chiefly by hunting and shoot'ing, and boil or roast all the meat they eat.Their standing dish consists of Indian corn soaked,then bruised and boiled. Their bread is likewisemade of wild oats, or sun-flower seeds. Theirgun, tomahawk, scalping-knife, powder and shot,they carry with them in time of war. They inwar decline open engagements; bush fighting orskulking is their discipline; they are brave whenengaged, having great fortitude in enduring tor¬tures and are the most implacably vindictive peo¬ple upon the earth; for they revenge the deathof any relation, or any affront, whenever occasionpresents, let the distance of time be never so re¬mote. After long enduring the greates of hard¬ships with these Indians. I at last escaped outof their hand and went to Quebec; where, 1 wasput on board a French Packet, bound for Eng¬land, and after a passage of six weeks. We, atlast, to our great joy, arrived at Plymouth, onthe 6th of November, 1756.FINIS

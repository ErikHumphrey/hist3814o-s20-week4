To part in peace is my advice;Then cease your botheration,Or it may cost you yet the priceO’ a sequestration.’*Then steering hame, wi’ something maThan some folk reckons plenty,I look’d on every thing as square,And sung a sang how dainty.Wi’ plans in plenty now afloat,Wi’ mair in prospect rising.And auld resolves amaist forgot,I gaed to bed revising.I clearly saw o’er every illThat had sae lately grieved,And wonder’d that my stupid skullIsae sooner had perceived;6But scarcely had I clos’d my ee,When I began a plungin’;Then, as I thought, baith bed an’ me,Into some darksome dungeon.Now deep an’ deeper down I fell,Terrific yet to think o’t,I thought that I was gaun to hell,An’ just upon the brink o’t,When, lo! a voice frae Night’s dark womb,Baith loud and shrill resounded,And rapidly dispell’d the gloomBy which I was surrounded;Then presently a hoary Sage,Wi’ countenance commanding.Who seem’d the vera sire o’ age.Was at my elbock standing:« O what art thou?—and where am I?”Were my interrogations.« Come, follow me,” was the reply,“ And have a little patience.”Then shewing me the Book o’ Fate,That idden myst’ries solved;Besides, a Glass to penetrateWhat was in doubt involved;7'Slid, “ I shall set before your eyesWhat mortal never saw yet;The dusky tow’rs o’ terror rise,\W what is to befa’ yet.”In deep perplexity immur’d,A little on he led me.Then something, just like Jonah’s gourd,He hoisted up to shed me.“ See, then—there stands a vale in view,Whase rising sides, romantic,Like prison wa’s, o’ dusky hue.Are mouldering, rude, an’ antique;Yon grand procession, at the end,Wha seem sae sair dejected,In G w unce were brawly ken’d,And muckle there respected,They’re gaun to Satan’s warehouse-door,Twixt hope and fear suspended.Although their wark has gane before.And loudly there commended.Yon chosen guards, wha tak’ the lead,Keep watching late and early,Wi’ their bold champion on their head—•Spring Water Wr— ——.s“ He’s fashion’d o’ a cross-grain stock.That’s sooner hrole than bendit-.Yet he’s bell wedder o’ the flock.Resolving to defend it;He never yet a step would takeThat conscience over-reached;But when his interest lay at stake,It canniely was stretched;And when disputes, o’ church or state,Ca’d forth his tongue to wield it,Sae skill'd in law, he would, tho’ beat,Be sooner damn’d than yield it.“ He’s set beyond the fear o’ hell, *By conscious approbation.An’ wish’d his weavers like himsel’,Were wordy o’ salvation.He lang had seen the arroganceProsperity ingendet’d,And griev’d to think, that by the fencebae thoughtlessly they wander’d:He saw, that keeping up the priceWas just the way to damn them;But taking alf the tither sliceWas just the way to tame them—9Now wi’ humility an’ rue.Already he has cram’d them.And left them just as scant o’ wooAs when their mothers lamb’d them—Thus he rescues them frae the Tod,Tho’ maist within his clutches,A double aim—It serves his God,And fills his greedy poutches.But then, to save the thoughtless brutes,That here and there had dauner’d,Eae eager were his.sharp look-outs,That he himsel’ has wander’d;He thinks na he’s sae near the denWhere Lowrie lurks to watch,him'.He blindly goes, nor well he ken,Till he spring out and snatch him.See! yonder stands the dismal gate.Just opening to receive them.Whilst their last hope, to hear it grate,Is on the wing to leave them:Hae, put this trumpet to your lug.And for a weeock rest ye,Then ye shall hear, and see incog.Wi’ nJething to molest ye!‘JOThen I beheld the Service-room,Elack, horrible, and dusky,Wi’ bleezes mingling vvi’ the gloom,That look’d like lovvan whiskey;And'warkmanship o’ blackest grain,Wi’ tvva three chosen swatches.That, faith! for some o’ Satan’s ain,Was even mair than matches;The fleecing sheers were also there,Besides the screw and grunstane,Wi’ Satan, in an easy chair,O het an’ Iowan brunstane,His under strappers at his lug,Oleg on the watch were station’d.Each, like a true Rat-catcher’s dog.As nimble as impatient.The grand procession, snug and tight,Were in the lobby ranged.And Satan at the pleasing sight,Frae black to blacker changed.—O Willy, were na ye a fool.Although ye dinna think it,Your Colleagues made o’ you a tool,To echo what they clinktf—sat  b  11But, hark! a sound! now gaping HellRe-echoes from its centre.And you O Willie! at the bell.As first in hand maun enter.He scarcely poppet in his nose.When Hell began to thunder,WT peals on peak, o’ loud applause;For Willie was a wonder.But Satan, frowning, rais’d his voice,“ Forbear, nor set so high a priceOn sic a worthless thing;fs it for him—For sic as he,That’s neither good for God nor me,That hell should loudly ring?Forbear your cheering for a-weeThere’s plenty at the doorDeserving a’ that ye can gie,And even rather more—Then let now, the Gloit now,Be quickly handed hence.And moor’d, and secur’d inThe dungeon o’ suspense.”12Then Willie, just like ane o’ worth,Was by a Dtemon handedBen to the snug and canny birth,As Satan had commanded;But gied a squeak, like oney rat,In horrid desperation,When seiz’d securly by the Cat,'And kens there's nae salvation,Now A w 1VI tentily,Was station’d at the key-hole.And brawly he cou’d hear and see;For it was not a wee hole.—Struck with his predecessor’s fate,Though loudly ca’d to enter,The first time in his life grew Mate,And laith was he to venture.He ca’d on Courage to his aid;But Courage didna hear him:He ca’d on Hope; but Hope had fled,And Mercy cou’d na bear him—What must be must—He ventures ben,Wi’ heavy heart, an’daunted,And, looking just as blunt as aneThat had na been acquainted.13Then Satan, bending frae his throne.Most heartily caress’d him,And in a sweet paternal tone.Endearingly address’d him:Ye’re welcome to your weel won hame.My true and trusty servant,For ye were neither lag nor lameTo make yoursel’ deservin’t;Haud up your face, and look na blate,Depend I’ll not neglect ye.Ye’ve gtown sae like myseP o’ late,I canna but respect ye.The child o’ self—your patron’s pride,—The brag o’ my dominions;For when your interest chang’d its side.Then chang’d ye your opinions;For when wi’ Paisley flock ye fed.Ye bleather’d loud amang them;But when ye got to yon Green-bead,Ye turn’d about to bang them!—Then, nane wi’ greater glee reveal’dAnother’s fau’ts an’ failings.But ay right prudently conceal’dYour ain unhallow’d dealings.'■m'v**?.Tor instance—tliere’s yon lawless shot—And hapless she that felt it—Had not the TlirJ—ye would your throatHae sooner cut than tell’d it;But ye denied as lang’s ye cou’d.Regardless tho’ ye wraaig’d her.Although, when in yon merry mood,Ye brewly kent ye bang’d her., « * ' ' ...t -“ Let Hell resound,” then Satan cries,“ Behold a brother in disguise.That merits your applause;Tho’ ance clad in a wedder’s skin,It happet hut a Ted within,Wi’ gaping, greedy jawsJust like mysel’—The lyart clock—AJy chosen hap and biel’,By which, upon the thonghtless flock.Insensibly I steal.Then, hark ye, i’ll mark ye.Exalted ye shall be,And fondled, and dandled,Upon your daddie’s knee.”i15Then catching A w hy the lugs.First face and features traces,Then fondly his dear darling huggs.In his rude rough embraces—Now Humphy G , your name is cried,Ye’re noted down a true ane;—As good a hand as ever triedThe twisting or the screwin’;Tho’ ye, amang the Vulture breed.Were never reckon’d ponderous;Yet, like the Sparrow-Hawk, your greedAn’ cunning has been wonderous.For ay the Fleecing-Sheers ye pliedWi’ activeness and keenness.And gart them bear upon the hide.Whiles deeper than the skin is:But yonder stands your just account,O’ broad and lengthened pages,O’ which ye’ll get the full amountO’ your weel earned wages.Then hearing, as he thought, his praise,Nae langer douhtfu’ saunter’d,But just (to use a sodger’s phrase)Right shoulders forward enter’d.

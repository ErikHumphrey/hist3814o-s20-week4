I’m sure you’re not wise ; %He’s a rude Highland fellow as poor as a crow,lie’s of the clan of Caithness for ought that I know..|l)ut if you go with him, I’m sure you’ll go hare,[You’ll have nothing father or mother can spare,lOf all I possess I’ll deprive you for aye,;If o'er the hills lassie you go away.It’s father keep what you are not willing to give.yFor fain would I go with him as sure as I live ;IjVVhat signifies gold or treasure to me,'If the Highland hills is between my love and me.(Now she is gone with him in spite of them a'.Away to a place that her eyes never saw ;.4He had no steed for to carry her on,But still he said lassie think not the roadiong.In a warm summer’s evening they came to a glen.Being wearied with travel the lassie sat down,Get up my brave lassie let us step on,For the sun will go round before we get home.My feet are all torn, my shoes are all rent,I’m wearied with travel and just like to faint,Were it not for the sake of your kind company,I would lie in the desert until that I die.The day is far spent and the night’s coming on,And step you aside to yon bonny mill town,And there you’ll ask lodgings for thee and for me,J'or glad would I be in a barn for to be.The place it is pleasant and bonny indeed,But the people are hard-hearted to us that’s in need.Perhaps they’ll not grant us their barn nor byre,But I’ll go and ask them as it is your desire.The lassie went foremost sure I was to blameTo ask for a lodging myself I thought shame,The lassie replied with tears not a few,It’s ill ale, said she, that’s sour when it’s new.In a short time thereafter they came to a grove,Where his flocks they were feeding in numberless droves,Allan stood musing his flocks for to see,Step on says the lady, that’s no pleasure to me.aA beautiful laddie, with green tartan trews,And twa bonnie lassies, were bughting in ewes,They said honoured master are you come again,I Long long have we look’d for you coming hame.: Bught in your ewes, lassies, and go your way hame,. I’ve brought a swan frae the north, I have her totame ;Her feathers are fallen and where can she lie ?The best bed in the house her bed shall be.The lady’s heart was far down it couldna well riseTill many a lad and lass came in with a phrase,To welcome the lady to welcome her home ;Such a hall in the Highlands she never thought on.j The laddies did whittle and the lassies did sing,1 They made her a supper might serve a queen ;I With ale and with whisky they drank her healthround,! And they made to the lady a braw bed of down.I Early next morning he led her to the hay,I He bid'her look round her as far as she could spy,d These lands and possessions my debt for to pay' You winna gae round them in a lang summer day..) 0 Allan, 0 Allan, I’m indebted to thee,ii It is a debt dear Allan I never can pay..* 0 Allan, 0 Allan, how came you for me,n Sure I am not worthy your bride for to be.How call you me Allan when Sandy’s my name,Why call you me Allan sure you are to blame :For don’t you remember when at school with meI was hated by all the rest but loved by thee ?How oft have I fed on your bread and your cheese.Likewise when you had but a haudful of peaseYour cruel hearted father hound at me his dogs.They tore my bare heels,, and rave all my rags.Is this my dear Sandy whom I lov’d so dear ?I have not heard of you this many a year,When all the rest went to bed sleep was frac meFor thinking on what was become of thee.My parents were horn lang before me,Perhaps by this time they are drown’d in the sea.These lands and possessions they left them to me,And I come for you, jewel, to share them with thee.«In love we began and in love we will end,And in joy and mirth our days we will spend.And a voyage to your father once more we will go,And relieve the old farmer from his trouble andwoe.With men and maid servants us to wait upon,So away to her father in a chaise they are gone,The laddie went foremost, the brave Highland loun,Till they came to the road that leads to the town.When he came to the gate, he gave a loud roar,Come down gentle farmer, Catherine’s at your door:<vVhen l;e look'd out at the window lie saw his daughter’sface,With his hat in his hand, he made a great phrase.Keep on your hat farmer, don’t let it fa,For it sets not the peacock to bow to the craw,It’s hold your tongue Sawney, and do not taunt me,loFor my daughter’s not worthy your bride for to be.N' ow he held his bridle reins, till he came down,I And then he conveyed him to a fine room ;i W ith the finest of spirits, they drank a fine toast,I Arid the son and the father drank both in one glass.THE CROOK AND PLAID.! If lassies loe the laddies, they surely should confess,ii For every lassie has a lad she loes aboon the rest,s He’s dearer to her bosom, whatever be his trade,a And through life I’ll love the laddie that wears theCrook and Plaid.He’s aye true to his lover, aye true to me.o He climbs the mountains early, his fleecy flocks toview,0 He spiers the little lavrocks, spring out frae among thedew,1 His faithful little doggie, so frolicksome and glad,Wander’s forward, with the laddie that wears the Crookand Plaid.For he’s Ac.He pues the blooming heather, he pues the lily meek,Calls the lily like my bosom, the heather like my cheek,His words are aye so tender, my heart.is aye so glad,There’s nae wooer like the laddie that wears the Crook:and Plaid.For he's &c.I winna hae the laddie that ca’s the cart and plough,Although he may be tender, although he may be true,But I will hae the laddie that has my heart betrayed,He’s the faithful shepherd laddie that wears the Crookand Plaid.For he’s &c.FINIS.

but they be faucy.Witn fine net-hnods upon their heads,er,ch dame a buckling-comb O,Which mounted >s with filver bright,and fet with Briflo’-ltone'O.Their lockets fine, that bright do fhine,a glancing broach below it;Their bravery full well you fee,how proud they are to ih <w it.With new-fashion capsofdifferent shapes,that are fo monftrous high O!Suoh florey piggs, upon their heads,are frightful to the eye O!( 7 )The other night I got fuch fright,.I blefsrd from all evil,\W en a lady came in shining robes,I thought it was the Devil!jWith a cap more high than granadand hair dreR in fuch order*She appeared like fweet Marg’ret’s gho(TyCoin’d from the Stygian border..'With fiiken hofe, and fine pink shoes,they are all trim’d a1 d ready ;It is not e*fy for to knowa fcodgie by a lady.JThere’s laffes bright turns out at- night,their fign is a white apron ;:'AH in the da^k to feek a. rpark,and wha but our Mifs K tthrine.:Some la{T:s then, I do offend,in telling of your knavery,'iFor that’s the way, I’m bold to fay,that you’ve won all your bravery,| The roving i* odds of Aberdeen,wnen they go to the dancing,I* The young men all admire he fport.they are fo neat and handfiiunc.( 8 )It is well kent, their face they paint,they are fo vain and idle ;To bulk and drefs, more time they pals,than they do on their Bible.With muffs and frils, and cardinals,made of the fineft fcarlet,They worn are, 1 do declare,by many a common harlot.Their qualitie, come show to me,you’ll not know’t by their deeding,D(7ar neighbour, then, I’ll tell you plain,you’ll find it byr their breeding.They curfe and fwear, and uominier,and fco’d like any randy ;Their morning drink, I really think,is wh'fky, gin or brandy.And if they chance to prove with child,or lofe their reputation,O then fets up a tipUng-houfe,and that’s their occupation.Such condudlleads from whores to thievesbut ’mark the difmal Uory !By hangy’s hands their lives they end,and that’s call’d Tyburn’s glory.Fal-de-ral-lal

sorrows,But I’ll gie you a sang about Donald Monro.He was rear’d in the north, ’mang the hills, near Lochaber,Whac clansmen hae march’d and loud bagpipes did blow,5In hii youth he was train'd baith to war and hard labour—Foret£s king an* his country lives Donald Monro.But now whar the rich ample garden discloses,It’s varied productions for use an‘ for show—'Mang the shrubs, an’ the fruits, an’ the sweet smelling roie*.Wi’ his spade an’ his knife, labours Donald Monro,He can delve, he can plant, he can graft, he can gatherThe weeds frae the soil—he can till, he can sow :He does all kinds of work, an’ braves all kinds of weather;For nought comes amiss to bold Donald Monro.When tired by the ills caus’d by Fortune and Folly,Or cheer’d by the fruits from industry that flow,Aye bear an’ forbear, an’ dismiss melancholy—An’ be thankfu’ for guid things says Donald Monre.Some lay up in store for an ill day a comeing;An die ere the guid o- their labours they know—But happen what will, he

the callin’O farmers, or men such as Donald Blonro.6THE AULD BEGGAR MAN.The Auld Beggar Man is a hearty auld cock;Wi’ his sair-tatter’d rags an' his muckle meal-pock,He lives like a king in the midst o’ the lan —He’s a slee pawkie body, the Auld Beggar Man.He has a white pow an’ a fresh ruddy check,For there’s sabbath to him ilk a day o the week :An’ he daunder’s aye onward the best way he canHe’s a canty bit carle, the Auld Beggar Man.The guidwife sets his chair by the clear ingle-side,Whar his feet may grow warm an’ his claes may be driedSyne the haill kintra’s clashes he screeds them off han‘He’s a gabbin bit birkie, the Auld Beggar Man.Wi‘ the guidman he cracks about cattle an* corn.Whether this rig or that ane the best crop has borne :How aits up hae risen an‘ ousen hae fa‘n,Like a beuk he can argue, the Auld Beggar Man.The bairns crowd aroun’ him his stories to hear,While maistly the wee things are swarfing wi’ fear,An’ he tells them how witches wi‘ auld Clootie ban.Till they creep to the knee o‘ the Auld Beggar Man.He‘s ane o‘ our ain fo‘k the lasses aye say ,When their wooers drap in at the close o‘ the day ;Sae he hears them mak‘ up ilk a lovin’ bit plan,He’s an auld farrent body the Auld Beggar Man.When the supper is done an’ the grace has been said,‘Mang the strae in the barn is the auld body’s bed—There he sleeps like a tap till the break o’ the dawn.He’s hale at the heart yet, the Auld Beggar Man.TWi‘ his staff in his hand, an‘ his pock on his back;He stoiters through life on a rough stoney track;His days whiles are dowie, but sin* they began,He has trusted in Heaven, the Auld Beggar Man.THE SONG OF THE GRAVE DIGGER.Poor mortals conceive as they stand on the ground.Supported by all that is solid and sound,’Tis a plank and beneath it, my work's to be found—I gather them in, I gather them in.The child, strong and healthy, careers on the heath,Not thinking, not caring, scarce knowing of death :In an instant he draws his last innocent breath :I gather him in, I gather him in.The youth in the vortex of folly and crime.Advised to repent answers, "Not in my prime."He would, if he knew he had run out his time ;I gather him in, I gather him in.Says Fifty, “Poor Sixty is breaking apace,lie must long, for the health that he sees in my face”Self-deceiver! he dreams not he's first in the race;I gather them in, I gather them in.Hazz i !“saysthe Dotard I’m turn'd of fourscore.And now I shall live to an hundred or more:”At night fall his coffin is brought to his door,I gather him in, I gather him in.The drunkard exclaims, Fill my cup to the brim,In water life sinks but in brandy ‘twill swim,He dies as he speaks, and I make sure of him :I gather him in, I gather him in.8The rich man observes his poor neighbour grow old.And hugs himself on his resources in gold ;A lackey all lace says “a knell must be told,I gather him in, I gather him in.E'en while he was speaking, the moralist elf.Was digging unthinking, a grave for himself;His spade and his mattock are laid on the shelf,They've gather'd him in. They've gather'd him in.‘18 O N G.We part, my love, to meet nae mair,‘Tis cruel Fate's decree ;And a’ the waes o black despairThis widowed heart maun dree.But thy lo’ed form, where'er I rove,I 11 still in f. ncy see,And mind our hours o'youthfu' loveTill I am doom d to dee.When a' the warl' in sleep were laid,And last thou met wi ‘ me,The sighs we breath d,‘and tears we shed,For aye shall sacred be.When death frae warl y waes and care*,This labouring breast shall free,My deare t bliss, in happier sphere*,Shall be to meet wi‘ thee.

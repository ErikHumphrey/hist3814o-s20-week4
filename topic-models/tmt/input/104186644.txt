I thought, atfirst you had more words than money!and now I am convinced of it: Pray, foryour credit’s sake, try your friends ; for Ihave three or four catskin’s more with1gold puddings in their bellies. Indeed,said the gentleman, I am content to owyou have outdone me, and think you havthe philosopher’s stone »or keep a familiarspirit to bring the gold to you from themines that produce that metal.

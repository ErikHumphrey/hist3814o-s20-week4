THE| -1 Wife of Bem9WITH A DESCRIPTION OF HER\Journey to Heaven.F^LKfRK :PKINTED L*. T. JOJ^NSTOM.PInburg^THEWIFE OF BEITH.In Beith once dwelt a worthy wile,Of whom brave Chaucer mention makesShe lived a licentious life,And namely in venereal acts :But death did come for all her craks,When years were spent and days out¬driven,Then suddenly she sickness takes,Deceast forthwith and went to heaven.But as she went upon the wav,There followed her a certain guide ;And kindly to her did say,Where mean you dame tor to abide ?I know you are the Wife of Beith,And would not then that you go wrongTor I’m your friend and will not loath1 hatyougothrough this narrow throngT his way is broader, go with me,And very pleasant is the way :I’ll bring there where you would be.Go with me friend say me not nay.She looked on him, then did speer,I pray you Sir, what is your name ? vShow me the way how you came here iTo tell it to me is no shame.3The Wife of Beith.Is that a favour ’bout your neck ?And what is that upon your side ?Is it a bag or silver sack ?What are you then where do you bide ?I was a servant unto Christ,And Judas likewise is my name.I knew you by your colours first,Forsooth indeed you are to blame;Your master did you not betray ?And hang yourself when ye had done ?Where’er you bide I will not stay ;Go then you knave let me alone.Whate’er I be I’ll be your guide,Because you know not well the wayWill you but once in me confide,I’ll do all friendship that I may.What would you me ?Where do you dwell,I have no will to go with thee ;I fear it is some lower cell,1 pray thee therefore let me be.This is a stormy night and cold.I’ll bring you to a warm inn ;Will ye go forward and be bold,And mend your pace till ye w in in.I fear your inn will be too warm,Foi too much hotness is not best ;Such hotness there may do me harm.And keep me that I do not rest;I know your way it is to hell,For you are not one of the eleven ;4The Wife ofBeith.Go haste you then in^o your cel],My way is only unto heaven.That way is by the gates of hell,If you intend there for to go,Go dame I will not you compel,But I with you will go also.Then down they went a right steephill,Where smoke and darkness did aboundAnd pitch and sulphur burned still,With yells and cries hills did rebound.The fiend himself came to the gate,And asked him where he had been jDo you not know and have forgot.Seeking this wife could not be seen.Good dime he said will you be hereI pray you then tell me your name;The wife ofBeith since that you speerBut to come in I were to blame.I will not have you here good dameFor you were mistress of the flyting,If once within this erate you come,I will be troubled with your biting.Cummer go back and let me be.Here are too many ofiyout rout;For women lewd like unto thee,1 cannot turn my foot about.Sir thief I say I shall bide out,But gossip thou wast ne’er to me ;For to come in, I’m not so stout.And of my bifihg thou’st be free ;5The Wife of Beith.iBut Lucifer what’s that on thee ?i: Hast thou no water in this place ?Thou look’st so black it seems to me,i Thou ne’er dost wash thy ugly face.If we had water here to drink,' We should not care, for washing then.I Into these flames and filthy stink,1 We burn with fire in the doom :I Upbraid me then good wife no more,i For first when I heard of thy name ;I knew thou had such words in store,1 Would make the devil to think shame.Forsooth Sir theif thou art to blame,If 7 had time now to abide ;’ Once ye were well but may thinkshameif That lost heaven fou rebellious pride ;if Who traitor-like fell with the rest,il Because ye wouitl not be content,I And now of bliss are depossest,w Without all grace for to repent. •I Thou mad’st poor Eve long sinceconsent.I To eat of the forbidden tree ;I (Which we her daughters may repent,}(j And made us almost like to thee ;E But God be blest who past thee byfl And did a Saviour provide ;1 For Adam’s whole posterity,’ f‘ All those who do in him confide,Adieu false fiend 1 may not bide,I With thee I may no longer stay •,6The Wife of Beith.My God in death he was my guide,O'er hell I’ll get the victory. *Then up the hill the poor wife .wentOpprest with stinking flames and fear,Weeping right sore, with great relent,Tor to go else she wist not where:A narrow way with thorns and briers,And full of mires was her before ;She sighed oft with sobs and tears.The poor wife’s heart w7as wondroussore ;Tir’d and torn she went on still,Sometimes she sat and sometimes fell,Aye till she came to a high hill,And then she looked back to hell.When that she had #lim’d up the hill,Before her was a goodly plain ;Where she did rest and weep her All,Then rose and to her feet again.Her heart was glad the way was good,Up to the hill she hy’d with haste,The flowers were fair where there shestood,The fields wrere pleasnt to her taste.Then she espied Jerusalem,On Zion’s mount where that it stood ;Shining with gold light as the sun,Her silly soul was then right glad:The ports of pearls shining bright,* Were very glorous to behold,With precious stones gave such a light,7The Wife of Beith.3e walls were of transparent gold,Ijgh were the walls thegates wereshut□d long she thought for to be in ;,it then for fear of biding out,e knocked hard and made some din.To knock and cry she did not spare,11 father Adam did her hear;ho is’t that raps so rudely there,eaven cannot well be won by weir,"he wife of Beith since that you speernth stood these two hours at the gate.iio back quoth he, thou must forbear,ere may no sinners entrance get.Adam quoth she, I shall be in,- spite of all such churls as thee ;rtiou’rt the original of all sin,V which thou art not fly ting free,ht for thy soul offences fled.rAdam went back and let her be,looking as if his nose had bled.| Then mother Eve did at him speer,f ho was it there that made such din?;e said a woman would be here,■liar me I durst not let her in.iril go, said she, and ask her will,er company I would have fain ;But aye she cried, and knocked stillnd in no ways she would refrain.Daughter, said Eve, you will do well,j o come again another time ;leaven is not won by sword or steel,g The Wife of Beilh.Nor none that’s guilty of a crime.Mother said she, the fault is thine,That knocking here so long I stand:Thy guilt is more than that of mi*ne,If thou wilt rightly understand,Thou Swast the cause of all our sin,Wherein we were born and concie'v’d,Our misery thou did’st begin,By thee thy husband was deciev,d;Eve went back where Noah was,And told him all how she was blam’d*Of her great sin and first trespass,Whereof she was so much asham’d.Then Noah said 1 will go down,And will forbid her that she knock ;Go back, he said, ye drunking lown,Your none of the celestial flock.Noah she said now hold thy peace,Where I drank ale thou didst drink wineDiscovered was to thy disgrace,When thou wast full like to a swine,If I was drunk I learn’d at thee.For thou’rt the father and the first,That others taught and likewise rr.e,To drink when as we had no thirst.Then Noah turned back with speed,And told the patriarch Abra’am then,How that the carlingmade him dread,And how she all his deeds did ken.Abra’am then said, now get you gone,Let us no more hear of your din ;9The Wife of Beith.No lying wife as I suppose,May enter in these gates within.Abra’am, she said will you but spareI hope you are not flyting free ;You of yourself had such a care,Deny’d your wife and made a lie :Oh then I pray you let me be,For I repent of all my sin,Do thou but open the gates to me.And let me quietly come in.Abra'am went back to Jacob then,And told his nephew how he sped,How that of her nothing he wan,And that he thought the carling mad.Then down came Jacob thro’ the close,And said go backward down to hell:Jacob, quoth she, I know thy voice.That gate pertaineth to thysell:Of thy old trumphries 1 can tell,With two sisters thou led’st thy life.And the third part of these tribes twelveThou got with maids besides thy wife ;And stole thy fathers bennison,Only by fraud thy father frae ;Gave thou not him for venison,A kid isstead of beaken rae ?Jacob himself was tickled so.He went to Lot where he was lying.And to the gate pray’d him to go,To staunch the carling of her crying.Lot says fair dame make less ado,10The Wife of Beith.And come again another day.Old harlot carle and drunkard too.Thou with thine own two daughters layOf thine untimely seed I say,proceeded never good but ill. vPoor Lot for shame than stole awayAnd left the wife to knock her fil-1,Meek Moses then went down at last,To pacify the carling then ;Now dame said he, knockfnot so fast.You knocking will not let you ben.Good <Sir she said I am aghast,Whene’er 1 look you in the face ;If that your law till now had last;Thera surely I had ne’er got grace :But Moses Sir now by your leave,Although in heaven you be possest,For all you saw did not believe,But you in Horeb once transgressed,Wherefore by all it is confest.You but got up the land to see.And in the mount were put to rest,Yea buried there where you did die.Moses meekly turned back,And told his brother Aaron there :. How the old carling did so c^ack,And in no ways did him forbear.Then Aaron said I will not swear,But I’ll conjure her as I can ;And I will make her now forbear,So that she shall not rap again.The Wife of Beith. 11Then Aaron said, you whorish wife,Get you gone and rap no more;; (With idols you have led your life,)) Or then you will repent it sore.Good Aaron priest I know you well,The golden calf you may, remember.Who made the people plagues to see.This is of you recorded evere :Your priesthood now is nothing worth,1 Christ is my only priest and he,! My lord who shall not keep me forth,! So I’ll get in, in spite of thee.Up started Sampson at the length,' Unto the gate apace came he,To drive away the wife with strength,I But all in vain it would not be.Samson, quoth she, the world maysee,Thou wast a judge that prov’d unjust,Those gracious gifts which God gavethee,Thou lost by thy licentious lust,From Delila thy wicked wife,Thy secrets chief couldst not refrain,j She daily sought to take thy life.Thou lost thy locks and then wastslain,Tho’ thou wast strong it was in vain,Haunted with harlots here and there,Then Sampson turned back again,And with the wife would mell nae mair.Then said king David knock no more,12The Wife of Beith.We are all troubled with thy cry.David quoth she, how cam’st thouthere,Thou might’ts bide out as well as I,Thy deeds no ways thou canst deny.Is not thy sin far worse than mine ?Who with Uriah’s wife did lie,And caus’d him to be murder’d syne.Then Jedith said who s there thatknocks,And to our nieghbours gave these notes ?Madam said she let be your mocks,I came not here for cutting throat's :I am a sinner full of blots,Yet through Christ’s blood I shall beclean,If you and I be judg’d by votes.The thing you did was worse than mine.Then said the sapient Solomon,Thou art a sinner all men say,Therefore our Saviour I suppose,Thee heavenly entrance will deny.Mind quoth she, thy latter days,What idol gods thou did upset,And wast so lewd in Venus’ plays,Thou didst thy Maker quite forget.Then Jonas said fair dame contentyou,If you intend to come to grace,You must dree penance and repent youEre you come within this place.13The Wife of Beith.Jone-as quoth she how stands the case?How came you here to be with Christ ?How dare you look him in the face ?* Considering how you broke your tryst,To go God’s errand thou withstood himAnd held his counsel in disdain;The raven messenger thou played him,And brought no message back again :With mercy thou wast not content.When that the Lord he did them spare ;Although the city did repent,It grieved thee thy heart was sair :Let me alone and speak no more,Go back again into the whale,For now my heart is also sore.But yet I hope I shall prevail.Good Jonas said crack on your fill,Fcr here I may no longer tarry,Yet knock as long as e’er you will,And go into the firry, farry.Jonas she says, ye do miscarry,As I have done in former time.You’re no Saint Peter nor saint Mary,Thy blot’s as black as ever mine.So Jonas then he was asham’d,Because he was not flyting free.Of all his faults she had him blam’d,He left the wife and let her be.Saint Thomas then I counsel thee.Go speak unto yon wicked wife,She shames us all, and as for me,14 The Wife of Beith.Her like I never heard all my life.Thomas then said, you make suchdin,When you are out, and meikle din,if you were here Til lay my life,No peace the saints will get within :It is your trade for to be dyting.Still in a fever as one raves,No marvel though you wives be biting.Your tongues were made of aspen leaves.Thomas quoth she let be your taunts,You play the pick-thank I perceive,Tho’-you be brother ’mang the saints,An unbelieving neart you have ;Thou brought the Lord unto the graveBut would no more with him remain,And wast the last of all the lave,That did believe he rose again.There might no doctrine do thee good,Nor miracles make thee confide,Till thou beheld Christ’s wounds andblood,And put’st thy hands into his side :Didst thou not daily with him bide,Andsee thewonderswhich he wrought?But blest are thy who do confide,And do. believe yet saw him not;Thomas she says, will you but speer,If that my sister Magdalen,Will come to me if she b?1 here ;For comfort sure you give me nane.15The Wife of^eith.He was so blythe he turned back,And thanked God that he was gane jHe had no will to hear her crack.But told it Mary Magdalen.When that she heard her sister’s mocksShe went unto the gate with speed :And asked her who’s there that knocks?’ 1 is I the wife of Beith indeed,She said good mistress you must stand,Till ye be try’d by tribulation.Sister quoth she, give me your hand,Are we not both of one vocation ?It is not through your occupation.That you are placed so divine.My faith is fixed on Christ’s passion,My soul shall be as safe as thine.Then Mary went away in haste,The carlin^- made her so ashamed,She had no wdll of such a. guest,To lose her pains and be so blamed.Now good Saint Paul, said Magdalen,Because you are a learned man.Go and convince this woman then.For I have done all that I can :Sure if she were in hell I doubt jThey would not keep her longer there,But to the gate would put her out;And send her back to be elsewhere.Then w7ent the good apostle Paul,To put the wife in better tune.Wash of that filth that fyles thy soul.16The Wife ofYieith.Then shall heav’n’s gates be open soon.Hemember Paul what thou hast done,For all th’ epistles thou didst compile.Though now thou sittest up above,Thou persecuted Christ a while/Woman he said, thou art not right,That which I did, I did not know ;But thou did sin with all thy might,Although the preachers did thee show.Saint Paul, she said, it is not so,I did not know as well as ye,But I will to my Saviour go,Who will his favour show to me:You think you are of flyting free.Because you were wrapt up above,But yet it was Christ’s grace to thee,And matchlessness of his dear love.Then, Paul, she says let Peter come,If he be lying let him rise,To him I will confess my sin,And let him quickly biing the keys,Too long I stand he’ll let me in.For why I cannot longer tarry,Then shall ye all be quit of din,For I mustspeak w-ithgood Saint Mary,The good apostle discontent,Right suddenly he turned back,For he did very much repent,To hear the carling proudly crack.Paul says good brother now arise,And make an end of all this din :17The Wife of Keith.And if be so you have the keys,Open and let the carling in ;The apostle Peter arose at last,And to the gate with speed he hies,Carling quoth he knock not so fast,You cumber Mary with your cries.Peter, she said let Christ arise,And grant me mercy in my need ;For, why I ne’er deny’d him thrice,As though thyself hast drne indeed.Thou carling bold what’sthat tothee ?I got re’mission for my sin ;It cost many sad tears fro me,-Before I entered here within :It will not be thy meikle did,Will cause heav’n’s gates opened be,Thou njust be purified of sin,And of all sins must be made free.Saint Peter than no thanks to you,That so you weie rid of ytmr fears.It was Christ’s gracious look I throw,That made you weep those bitter tears,The door of mercy is not clos’d,I may get grace as well as ye,It is not so as ye suppos’dI will be in, in spite of thee.But wicked wife it is too late,Thou shouldest have mourn’d uponearth,Repentance now is out of date :It should have been before thv death :V '18The Wije oj Heith.Thou mightest then have turned wrathTo mercy then and mercy great,But now the Lord is very loth,And all thy cries not worth a jotAh ! Peter then what shall 1 do ?He will not hear me as I hear,Shall I despair of mercy too !No no I’ll trust in mercy dear :And if I perish here I’ll stay.And never go from heaven bright jI’ll ever hope and always pray,Until I get my Saviour’s sight.I think indeed you now are right,If you had faith you could win in i5!Importune t.ien with all your might,Faith is the feet wherewith ye come :It is the hands will hold him fast,But weak faith never may piesume;’Twill let you sink, and be aghast.Strongly believe or you’re mi done.But good Saint Peter, let me be.Had you such faith did it abound ?When you did walk upon the sea,Were ye not likely to be drown’d ?Had not our Saviour helped thee,Who came and took thee by the hand :So can my Lord do unto me,And bring me to the promis’d land,Is my faith weak ? Yet he is stillThe same and ever shall remain ;His mercies last and his-good will,19The Wife of YSeith.I’o bring me to his flock again ;He will me help and me relieve,4nd will increase my faith also,■ f weakly I can but believe,For from this place I’ll never go.But Peter said how can that be ?How dar’st thou look him in the face ?inch horrid sinners like to thee,Can have no courage to have grace ;Here none comes in but they that’sstout,i|4nd suffer’d have for the good cause ;Like unto thee are keeped out,For thou hast broken all Moses’ laws.Peter she said I do appeal,From Moses and from thee also ;filWith him and you I’ll net prevail,But to my Saviour 1 will go:/ndeed of old you were right stout,iWhen you did cut off Malchus’ ear;iBut after that you went about,\And a poor maid then did you fear.[Wherefore Saint Peter do forbear,\A comforter indeed you’re not ;.Let me alone I do not fear,"Take home the wissel of your groat:|Was it your own or Paul’s good sword,When that your courage was so keen,'You were right stout upon my word,Then you would fain at fishing been ;1 For ere the crowing of the cock,«0The Wife ofjteith.You did deny your master thrice,For all your stoutness turnd a block,Now ftyte no more if ye be wise.Yet at the last the Lord arose,Environed with angels bright,^4nd to the wife in haste he goes.Desir'd her to pass out of sight.O Lord quoth she, cause me do rightBut not according to my sin ;Have you not promis’d day and night,When sinners knock to let them in ?He said thou wrests the scriptureswrong,The night is come thou spent the day*In whoredom thou hast lived long,And to repent thou didst delay ;Still my commandments thou abus’dAnd vice commited’st busily.Since now my mercy thou refus’d’st,Go down to hell eternally.O Lord, my soul doth testify,That / have spent my life in vain ;! make a wand’ring sheep of me,And bring me to thy flock again.Think’st thou there is no count tocrave,Of all these gifts in thee was planted,/ gave thee beauty ’hove the lave,A pregnant wit thou never wanted*Master, quoth she. it must be granted,My sins are great give me contrition :21The VTifc of'Qeith.The forlorn son when he repent,Obtain’d his father’s full remiss'on.I spar’d my judgment many times,And sp’rtual pastors did thee send ;But thou renew’d’st thy former crimes,Aye more and more me to offend.My Lord quoth she I do amend.Lamenting for my former vice,The poor thief at the latter end,For one word want to paradise.The thief heard never of my teachings.My heavenly precepts and my laws,But thou wast daily at my preachings,Both heard and saw and. yet misknowsMaster quoth she the scripture shows,The Jewish woman who play’d the lowuConform unto the Hebrew laws,Was brought to thee to he put down ;But nevertheless thou let’st her go,yfnd made the Pharisees afraid.Indeed says Christ, it was right so,And that my bidding was obey’d,Woman he said 7 may not cast.The children’s bread to dogs like thee.Although my mercies yet do last,There’s mercy here but none for thee.But loving lord may / presume,Poor worm that / may speak again,The dogs for hunger were undone,And for the crumbs they were rightfain ;The Wife oj TSeith.Grant me one crumb that then doth fallFrom thy blest children’s table Lord,That I may be refres’d withal,It will me help enough afford.The gates of mercy now are clos’d,^nd than canst hardly enter in ;7t is not so as thou suppos’d,For thou art deadly sick in sin,’Tis true indeed my Lord most meek,My sore and sickness I do feel:Yet thou the lame dost truly seek,Who lay long at Bethesda’s pool,Of many that thee never sought,Like to the poor Samaritan ;Whom thou into thy fold has brought,FiVen as thou didst the willow of Nain :M6st gracious God, didst thou not bid,All that were weary come to thee ?Behold 7 come ! even o’erloadWith sin, have mercy upon me.The issues of thy soul are great,Thou art both leprous and unclean,To be with me thou art not fit,Go from me then let me alone.Let me thy garments once but touch,My bloody issue will be whole,It will not cost thee very much,To save a poor distressed soul.Speak thou the word I shall be whole,One look of thee shall do me good,Save now good Lord my silly soul,4iThe Wife of'Qeith.2 3rsiBought with thine own most preciousblood,Let me alone none of my blood,Was ever shed tor such as thee,It was my mercy patience good,Which from damnation made thee free.It is conf'est thou hast been just,Altho’ thou had condemned me;But O ! thy mercies still do last,To save the soul that trust in thee :Let me not then condemned be,Most humbly Lord I thee request.Of sinners all none like to me,.So much the more thy piaise shall lastThy praising me is not perfite,My saints shall praise me evermore ;7n sinners 1 have no delight,Such sacrifice / do abhore.Then she unto the Lord did say,At footstool of thy grace I’ll lie ;Sweet Lord my God say me not nay,Foi if I perish here I’ll die.Poor silly wretch then speak no moreThy faith poor soul hath saved thee ;Enter thou in unto iny glore,And rest thro’ all eternity.How soon our Saviour these wordssaid,A long white robe to her was given ;Tnd then the angels did her leadForthwith within the gates of heaven :(H The Wife qfY^eith.A laurel crown set on her head,.Spangled with rubies and with gold :A bright white palm she always had,Glorious it was for to behold ;Her face did shine like to the sun,la’ke threads of gold her hair hung downHer eyes like lamps unto the moon,Of precious stones rich was her crown.Angels and saints did welcome her,'The heavenly choir did sing rejoice :King David with his harp was there :The silver bells gave a great noise.Such music and such melody,Was never either heard or seen,When this poor saint wasplac’d sohigh, IAnd of all sins made freely claen ;But then when thus she was possest,And looked back on all her fears :^/nd that she was come to her rest,Free’d from her sins, and all her tears,She from her head did take the crown, ,Giving all praise to Christ on high,And at his feet she laid it down.For that the Lamb had made her free,Now doth she sing triumphantly,And shall rejoice for evermore,()’er death and hell victoriously,With lasting pleasures laid in store.FINIS.

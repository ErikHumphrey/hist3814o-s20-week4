MACNI&.1889.( r ^qF SCOTLAND ^ ,THELONDON SPY.THE many shocking crimes committed Ii* and about London as well as frauds andcheats daily practised on the unwary trademan, mechanic and deluded countrymen,call aloud for detection and discovery.—Much has already been writen from timeto time on this subject, and, in many in¬stances with good effect: but, as too muchpraise cannot be bestowed on Virtue, soneither can too much be written in pour-traying Vice in its proper deformity, inorder to give mankind a detestation thereto:therefore a timely warning against that va¬riety of iniquity and roguery, which at pre-jsent is carried on by the wicked and aban-Sdoned, to the injury and frequent ruin ofthe unhappy as well as unthinking part ofthe world who have the mi°fortune to fallinto their hands, become still necessary.3For these necessary and salutary purposesthefbliowing description was written, to putthe unwary on their guard, that they mayavoid the snares of deceivers; to display thevarious practices made use of, to cheat anddefraud, and to caution them against credu.lity and plausible fiction, which too oftemare productive of as bad consequences asthe more barefaced crimes herein specified.The reader will observe, that in generalI have addressed myself io countrymen andwomen, for the following reasons : As theyare at a distance from London ami perhapshaving imbibed too favourable and flatteringideas of its wealth, magnitude, and grandeurmay be induced thereby to repair to themetropolis, rather than remain in the coun¬try ; and before they havebeenintown twen-ty.four hours are frequently ruined by the; sons and daughters of dissipation, who lie inwait to deceive and destroy all who are eoi unfortunate as to fall into their clutches. Iftn order likewise, to put those whose businessI demands their presence in London, on their| guard against frauds, cheats, and imposters,1 lhavedisplayedthevariousnewmethodsihey1 practise in pursuit of their villanous andilicit proceedings, the better to enable my14country readers to escape the traps laid forthem ; which being properly attended to,will enable theai rot only to avoid, but todetect, and bring to justice the violaters cfthe laws of their country.GAMBLERS.There are as many kinds of gambling,as their are trades, and they move in asmany spheres, from the most noble duke or ;dutchess, to the most abandoned chimney. !sweeper; pretenders to honour and honesty, |iversed in various tricks and art, by which inwmy among both nobility and gentry havesquandered away their fortunes in accom-1plishing themselves for the epithet of a coin- iplete Gambler, or, in the true sense of theword an expert Gambler. If instances wereaccessary to prove the assertion, I could pro¬duce hundreds within my own knowledge,many not above a twelvemonth ago thathave been ruined by the pernicious itch ofgaming. Young noblemen and gentlemen,just come to clear estates, and affluent for-twines, have in the hour of dissipation, beenway laid by gamblers, and through theirarts, frauds, and deceptions, have been strip¬ped of the last shilling-—Tradesmen aidsothers, though not exactly in the same way*yet in ways similar to the before mentioned,have been tricked of all by the gamblers ;the consequences whereof have been emigra¬tion, bankruptcy, or imprisonment. Thelower class of mankind having had theirshare of the supposed run ot ill luck, orfrowns of fortune, as they call it, and notknowing when they are imposed on, havebecome sufferers in the last degree ; manyof whom, in order to retrieve their losses,have had recourse to picking ot pockets,shop lifting, and such like offences, till, em¬boldened by success, and for some lengthof time escaping detection, they have set outon greater explods, such as breaking intohouses by night, robbing on the highway, &c*till at length they finish their career a* New¬gate, where they have declateri, that love ofgambling was the first step that led them osto the commission of greater crimes.I shaii now give you a» account of thegames at which the Gambler is most dex¬terous, and the mearas by w hich he imposeson and deb amis others, the better to put youon your guard against his villainy.-—I shallmention several ct the most fashionable andallurieig pleasures at which their various me-6Ihods of deluding and cheating are practisedwith success, via. Gaming houses, Horse¬races, Cock fighting, Bowling, Billiards,Tennis, Pharch Couger etnair, Hazard, &c.together with Routs, Assemblies, Masque¬rades, and Concerts of a particular or pri¬vate nature ; in the latter of these you willfind notorious gamblers of the female sex,who deal in art and deception, as well assome more notorious male cheats, who fre¬quently barter one commodity for anotherprovided discount is allowed.In this great city are several houses notonly converted, but others built, for the as¬sembly of gamblers, into which, however,none under a certain degree are admitted,unless a friend of a subscriber is introducedas a novice in the art, in order to be initiatedinto those rules of fraud and cunning theysquare his actions by : his admittance maybe effected at the expenceoffive or ten thou¬sand pounds, and a qualification is given ofhis adoptness in the science, which will e-nable him to exhibit with eclat at Newmar¬ket or York races. These pretenders to hon.or and honesty, have been detected manyrimes in practising the vilest frauds at play,particularly at th e game of hazard, which is©uch in vogue among the gamblers, whoi carry false dice which they substitate iaI the room of fair ones, with so much dexteri-i ty and slight, that the cheat is not thoughtof.northedicesuspected; forshouldyouexa-mine them, it would be almost impossible tofindoutthedeceptionunless you were versedin their arts and tricKs—Thus set up withfalse dice, false cards, and a wicked design¬ing heart, they prey upon the ignorant andunthinking : And as they head together ©aall occasions, so they give each oiher assist-Snce ; whilst one gamester is cheating th«man of fortune within doors, others are lay¬ing traps for them without, by procuring in¬formation of his estate or fortune from hisservants or acquaintances, procuring stamp#to assign over his estate, in readiness, tellingtheold usurer, that money is wanted at B—9,and if he does not be quick with it, his bro¬ther Jew in iniquity, shall be before handwith him—The sum must be a round one,for the prodigal has many thousands acres tobe disposed of, and that immediately.—A waybobbles the old gentleman, who generallyreceives so much per cent, for the moneyhe lends, till between them all, the gentle¬man is fleeced of part, if not his whole estate$8The shame of being thought bubble, au4exposed to the town., frequently preventsgentlemen from making use of the statuteprovided in such causes, rather than theirveputation should suffer, they tamely submit?o be plundered as aforesaid.At Horse races the countryman maybe assured of meeting with gamblers, whomake a practice of going from one race toanother all over the kiiigdom ; and, notwith¬standing the country farmer, and breeder ofhorses, may in reality, be a better judge ofthese cattle then the gamester, yet l wouldcaution him against wagering with thesegentry, as they, becoming parties in manymatches, getinformation from differentbandswhich horse is, and which is not to win, andthat means generally take you in, as theycall it, and laugh at your folly—They oftenmake bets among themselves, merely to de¬ceive you, and give a preference to the horsethey know must lose, in order to draw vou into lay money upon it.—If it happens (whichis seldom the case) that an honest match isto be run, of which they are unacquainted,then they make use of the following or likestratagem, to insure their pockets ; that i?,they lay you a bet, and put the money into9the nest gentlera^n’s hands to hold, whomIthey pretend they do not know (though he isat the same time their intimate colleague',if you win the gentleman is not to be foun tif vou loss, then one of them meets von, withmuch concern in his countenance, and sayshe, by following your example, and layingon the wrong horse, has lost twice your sum;then squeezes you by the hand, and wishesyou better luck another titne} and so bidsyou farewell for the present.Cock-fighting, of all games, is surelyone of the most barbarous, and a scandal tothose who follow it, both high and low ; tor,f notwithstanding its antiquity, as a diversion,(l| in England, it is a great disgrace to huma¬nity ; and surely none but the most notoriousgamblers can be elated therewith, or givea sanction to barbarity, that even shocksthe wild Indian to hear of.—At these scenesof cruelty the greatest depredations are Cbm-mitted by the attendants thereon, the mostprofane and wicked expressions made use of,the most horrid and blasphemous oaths andcurses denounced against Fortune for theloss of their unlawful expectations.i10With respect to other diversions, fuehale Bowling, Billiards, Tennis &c. they Ihave each their different pleasures, and inthemselves are very inoffensive, genteel,und manly ; but, like others, are frequen¬ted by gamblers, and therefore to be shun.«ed. Thefrauds practised in the above gamesare various, and depends much upon the skillof the gamester, who becomes proficient bydaily practice, -and in order to make a good omarket, can play at them either well or ill, Iand gets or loses, as he finds most conduciveto his interest ; for, as fie lives by cheating, L■to lose sometimes may lead to his winning at Iothers ; or by agreeing to take your part a- jgainst his brother gamblers, which being ;yielded to, he first loses that he may after- ■wards win a part of your money, which is «.divided amongst them when you are gone.•Should you play: at these diversions, let it beonly for trifles j but above all, beware ofbetting or engaging in company you or yourfriends have no knowledge of; for if you doten to one but you are had, a cant wor f theymake use of, instead of saying as the truthis, we have cheated hirp.SHARPERS.The Sharper who has got a general edu-; cation, and has a good address and conver-! sation, has more the power of delusionI than the unlettered cheat, devoid pf address,and other requisites, to complete the pr$-1 tended gentleman, and therefore should he: more carefully avoided. These villains,i having run through their fortunes at an ear-I lyperiodoflife, byassociatingwithprofessed.| gamblers and sharpers, who having eased! them of their money, in return completeI them ior the profession by which they haveI been ruined j thus qualified they set up farI themselves,throwasidehonorandconsciencei and quote thelextalionisfordeceivingothemi as they themselves have been deceived.These gentry are to be met with at allpublic places of diversion, the Horse-race,Cock fight, Billiard, and Hazard tables.—l! They pretend to be men of quality, or inde-: pendent fortunes; many of whom keep theiri equipages and filles de joye, without a footof land, or shilling in tlte funds, merely bydint of industry, in taking in the unthinkingspendthrift, just come to his possessions,leand so qualifying him for the same laudableprofession on the expeecliture thereof, to en¬able him to rab through life by the art of•alculatipn.—Being, by theory, as well asconstant practice complete proficients in thedifferent games they play, these cheat? areseldom deceived in the skill and manage¬ment of their antagonists iu*\i in a very shorttime can discover whether they are accom¬plished professors cr only novices, and ac¬cordingly play the game to advantage.On your entering the tavern, coffee orgaming house the sharper views you withattention, aud is not long before he becomesacquainted and very intimate with you : Ifyou agree to his proposal to play, if he can-not beat you by fair, he will by foul meansrather than lose, he will elude your attention,or raise your passion sufficiently to put youoff your guard, while he plays his underhandgame, and cheats you before your face andthough you are sensible of being cheated#yet you shall not be able to discover by whatmethods it is effected—So fallacious arethese Sharpers, that they will prey on theirfriends and nearest relations, rather than beidle and unemployed, yet seldom engagewch other unless lor instructions, and to keep2!I themselves in practise.—The generous andi misuspeC'inggentleman is often fleeced of hisI binh-iightand inheritance, by entering intw| partnership with the Sharper, who is artful1 and industrious, inlosingtohisassociatesj andcheating the friend that iustrusted him, whopaid a legard to his instructions, ihoiouhijrconvinced of his pretended rectitude andIf honesty.— The guroe being over, aud the| gentlemangonp, theSharpersdivide the spoils amongst them and laugh at the inexperienceand folly of the deluded, ending with, “He. does nor yet know life ”—Some Sharpers*si in high life, will invite their acquaintanceand neighbours to dine or sup with them,I for no oth r purpose than to make them payi severely for the treat, by proposing a gamei at cards after supper, which is generallydone by one of the accomplices, and agreedto by another, the master upon these oc¬casions, sometimes is left out, the better tocarry on the'design, and prevent suspicion offoul play, or, at least, of his having a handin it at the lime ; that he sometimes makeone, but generally loses with every partnerhe engages, till the company are'bankrupt*,and the Sharpers the only gainers thereby.Many a round sum is revised by them in thisU 'manner to rave then f rom a jail, or to sup.port the luxurious and abandoned lives theylead, having every delicacy in season 'vithwhich their tables are furnished, and cellarsstored as a bait to catch gudgeons, whoare easily allured thereby. Their con¬sciences being seared, regardless of the cen--sure of the world, or dictates of humanity,and plunged in different vices, without mo¬ral sentiment or honor, is it to be wonoeredat, if even they cheat their father ’or bro¬ther at play, much less their friends, ac-tjuaiintance, and mankind in genend?If you associate with Sharpers, you mustnot only expect, but deserve to be cheatedby them for your credulity, insufficiency,or stupidity : for who would go with hiseyes open into a den of thieves, but in ex¬pectation of being robbed ? Or who wouldlierd with Sharpers and not expect to becheated ? 'I herefore my advice is, to shunthese reptiles of the creation, fraught withguile, and artful as the serpent to delude..Beware of their conversation, shun theircompany, take no notice of their tricks andfancies j nor be bought with their wheed¬ling professions of friendship : listen not untothem or their enticements, if you would pre-15preserve your peace and property. Be notfond of making new acquaintances with per.sons whose characters you are strangers to,however genteel in appearance and behavi¬our ; for many a Sharper lurks under thedisguise of our modern line gentlemen, asdaily experience fatally shews.SWINDLERS.Of all the vices, frauds, and cheats,related and exhibited, there is not one that; has been more successful, and of old stand¬ing, than that of swindling; which, liko,11 the plague, still rages thro’ these kingdom*. with devastation, to the great wrong andi injury of multitudes, both in town andin country. To expose their pernicious prae-I tices, and the bad effects produced thereby,ji may in some measure stop the progress ofI this growing evil and tend to crush the hy¬dra before it has power to do furtheri mischief: I shall therefore be as exact asj possible in relating one or two of the mosti glaring and flagrant deceptions practised;on the unwary, iu order to give the readertan insight into the nefarious and audacious.proceedings of Swindlers, that they may be«16be enabled to prevent any future attemptsof the like nature upon them by these pesteof society. This new species of knavery,carried on by Swindlers appears speciousin itself, the practisers thereof settingthemselves up for men of property and in¬tegrity, the more easily to defraud the un¬wary and ignorant out of their substanceand effects ; to obtain which, among many,the following is practised : A number ofthem, being connected together, take a gen¬teel house in a reputable part of the town,and divide themselves into classes of master,clerks, out-riders, shopmen, porters, and ||servants. From their making a shew of Iopulence, they easily obtain credit, and layin goods of every kind, which they send ,into the country, and sell or barter forother commodities, which they bring upto London and sell for ready money, gene- ■rally taking in exchange double the quantity, ,,and paying for the same with notes of theirown drawing, indorsing, and fabricating forthe purposes of cheating the poor deluded ■farmer, shop-keeper, and tradesman, in the if.,interior parts of the country. With respect .to tradesmen in town the goods they take iof them on trust, they dispose of to Jews,17i and other receivers of stolen goods, at abouti thirty per cent, under value, for ready-mo-! ney, nay, fifty per tent, rather than notI have the cash ; and as their stay in a placei cannot safely be above six months, on ac-i count of their creditors calling m their debts,and their country-notes becoming due, theyi make all possible dispatch to dispose of thevarious articles, and evacuate the premises! before detection. This done, they play the! same game elsewhere, when, Proteus like,! they change shapes, and disguise themselvesso, as not to be known, and carry on ano¬ther house, but in a different name an man¬ner the master becomes the rider, the riderthe master, the clerks descend to footmenand porters, the porters and footmen toclerks, and so on throughout, till they havedrained many parts of town and country,] to the ruin of many worthy and honest mennin business.These Swindlers have been very artfulIjlin evading the law, in negociati^g the badMnotes they had circulated about the country.[JThey are generally done on copperplates,las neatly as the banker’s: some of them! ar« drawn at sight, others at a longed orShorter date, as suits their conveniency;18the drawer carries them about him all overthe country,, and disposes of them, a secondindorces, a third accepts, but none to pay.But notwithstanding all the arts and in¬sinuations of these Swindlers, they are easilysingled out in a company, from a pretendedhurry in business, and fear of detection ;eyeing every person askance, doubtful ofhaving seen them before.PICKPOCKETS.There are more Pickpockets in andabout London, than in all Europe beside,that make a trade, and what they call a©omfortable living by their employment.—The Opera, Play-Houses, Capital Auctions,and Public Gardens, swarm with them;and of late years they have introducedthemselves into our very Chuich.es, in whichthey have not been less successful, at a cha-fity Sermon preached by a Komaine orother noted orator, than at the Theatres,at a Benefit, when the principal parts have,been played by a Kemble, Siddons, Jordan,Incledon, Munden, and other first rate per¬formers. To set forth the different way*2I . 19ibj which they succeed in their nefariou*practises, would be tedious; therefore I shalli only observe, that in general two go together'one before and the other behind the personwhose pocket is to be picked j the formerof which stops the person either in a croud* „or by a pretending accident, while the othereffects the business. Therefore it would beprudent, when in crouds, to keep one handon your money, and the other on yourswatch; when you find any one push against-you: But should you be robbed tor wantof taking proper care to prevent the same,itake no notice till you see some person near;you stealing away, when you are to secureihim or her, and ten to one but you fix oni the right person. You must however, bei careful to lay hold of their hands, for feariof their conveying your property to ani,accomplice who is always ready to receiveithe same, and set off with it Some Piclc-ipockecs are very dextrous in this way, by[introducing their hands, without being per-:ceived, into the very bottom of the breeches.Others in introducing their hands up Ladies':petticoats, taking hold of the pocket, andsomaking an incision with a knife or scissars,and letting out the contents into their handswithout discovery, which they immediatelydeliver to their asscoiates without stirringfrom the place, to prevent detection.Pickpockets do not confine themselvesto London, but travel all over the country,to fairs and horse-races, and are to be metwith on the stands, and in the booths tothe experience of many gentlemen and others 1who have lost purses, watches, rings, and jpocKet-books, of which they never received |any accounts. Pocket-book are only secureru the inside-pockets, and ihe coat buttoned.Watch chains should be run through a smallloop, contrived for the purpose securingthe watch in the fob, which many practise.But at these public places, it is necessaryfor all persons to be upon their guard, a*they cannot be ignorant of the gentry theyhave amongst them, from the many losssustained by them.)?U151MONEY-DROPERS.These gentry generally ply at the mo?tpublic places in town, and also at fairs andcountry markets, consisting of three or morein company. The dropping of money isthe lure to inveigle countrymen into com.pany, and is accomplished in the followingmanner: The Dropper, when conveniencysuits lays down a guinea, 01 other piece ofmoney, close to any country man ; then ina voice of exultation exclaims, 1 have founda guinea ! Upon which a second comes up,mnd says. Where is it ? or, I’ll not believe itHere it is, cries the former, and appeals tolithe country.man for the truth of his pickingJit up ; who answering in the affirmative,ithe second claims a share, as they were incompany together : upon which the first re.i torts. If any body has a right to a share,lit must be this honest countryman, whoitaw it on the ground as well as myself.—]By this time they are arrived at a house, ofresort, and the Droper proposes givingithem a treat out of it if they will walk in ;; intimating at the same time, that he intendsI to consider the country.mau as a party con.£2eerned, who has a right to share thereThis bait taking, in they go, observedthe thiid, who hitherto had appeared to tano notice of the others, then call for a rooand sorrething to drink. The Dropper thasks the country-man if he has gotten asilver to give in change for the guineaAnd according to his answer they ordtheir matters. While they are engagedsharing the monev, the third enters, wb;sits down, without seeming to know any onpresent on their business. On the Dropper1saying, he will gxr out and get change, thsecond replies, It is scarce worth while fcseven shillings; and seeing a pack of cardon the chimney piece, proposes cutting cthem for the sum, which the other acceptsthe second loses, and the countryman iasked it he wid risk his seven shillings, whthinking he can be nothing out of pockeif he loses, accepts the challenge, and wintwo cr three times, when a game of Whisis proposed, and agreed to, i( a fourth coulobe found. The pretended stranger says, ithey will accept of a bad player, rather thac1'spoil sport, he will make one* The Drop,per and country man agree to be partnersdown they sit; the country-man and his'113artner are successful ; they wager on theIdd trick, the best trump double, and trebletie stakes, till, by sad reverse of fortune,ijhe deluded country-man and his arttuiartner are stripped of the last farthing., RING-DROPPERS.These are a set of cheats, who frequentlyrick simple people, both from the countryind in London, out of their money; butinost commonly exercise tneir villainous artjpon young women. Their method of pro.:;.eedin£ is thus: Privately to drop a ring,rust before such persons come up, when theyfccost them as follows: Young woman, IIiave found a ring, and believe it is gold,or here is a stamp upon it. Immediatelyipon this an accomplice joins him, who,ibeing asked the question, replies, It is gold.Well, says the former, as the young woman|aw me pick it up, she has a right to half ofIt. As it often happens that the youngjaerson has but a few shillings on her, theIjropper says, If you incline for the ring,ayou shall have it for what you have in yourpocket, and what else you can gi ve me ;—which sometimes proves to be a (good hand.24kwchief, cloak, or other apparel. The yourwoman being just about to take the riiiand gave the money and things for it, taccomplice says, You had better ask a golsmith if it is gold, but looking about, 'perceives the shops are shut up, being la iUpon which trey conclude it is gold, aiso part. The deluded creature then sher;the ring to a person in the street, who i:forms her she is cheated by sharpers, fthe ring is not worth twopence, being onbrass gilt, and false stamp put on to deceithe unwary.The above relation is a fact, and t!fraud was practised by these pestilent bar pion a young woman in London.To avoid such company in Lendomuch more gaming with them, Strangeought constantly to be on their guard, arimmediately abscond when they meet wittuch characters.UNIS.

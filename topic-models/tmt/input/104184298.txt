The former, con.taiuing in itself “ a shadow of good thing? tccome,” abounding with numerous ceremonnvinstitutions, imposed upon the worshipers A YOKI• Etkc xxrt. 47.]&($£ • ■ w ■ ■ :.5*-. •.. .3i or bondage which they Were scarcely able to| bear. In the kingdom of Christ, the ritualj observances are only two—Baptism and the] Lord’s Suppjer. It may also be remarked,j that, whereas the meaning and import of the1 former wn§, in many cases, very obscure, it isl the glory of the New Testament ordinances, thatI they were designed to embody the leading factsI and doctrines of the glorious gospel of the blessedI God, and so by means of external signs *‘t»i make our sense assist our faith.” In their few-i aess and sinrpllcity they correspond with thei spiritual nature of the Messiah’s kingdom, and; with its designed universality.' lew and simple! as they are, however, they have been much: misunderstood and grossly perverted by the| greater part of professing Christiana, Thisrhasi in a great measure arisen from not seeking in-| formation ' as to the mode and import of chrisftanI ordinances in the New Testament, but in the1 Old ; and this has been particularly the ease inrespect to Baptism. It must have been mattoi'of remark to all who have Witnessed the celehra-. tion of the Lord’s Supper,*—that in bringing! forth the authority for attending to.this ordinance,the minister does not refer his hearers to thatportion of Scripture in Exodus,—-where the in¬stitution of the Passover is described, but to thosepassages in the New Testament where thej Lord’s Supper; is mentioned,—such as Mat.j xxvi. 26. or 1 Gor. xi. 23. This is right;and were the same mode adopted in reference tothe ordinance of Baptism, much mistake and4cm), o„ that: subject would be avoided. AnI h^ been entertained that the ordinances ofJesus Christ have succeeded certain Jewish ob¬servances and an analogy or resemblance hasbeen traced betwixt Circumcision and Baptism ;but whde the mode, the time,‘and the subjectsof the former have been clearly understood, thesecircumstances as to the latter have been totallymisapprehended. In reading the institution o'fbaptism by our Lord, we find it to be no lessdistinct than that of Circumcision: the subjectsare expressly pointed out to be “ those who be¬lieve the gospel:” the time of its being attendedto,—WHEN THEY BELIEVE J while the MODE,or manner of attending to it, is described by thename of the ordinance. We shall in the firstplace consider, what is the mode or manneof Baptism.Baptize is a Greek word, which the trans¬lators of the Bible have only given an Englishform, but not translated. It properly signifiesto DIP, PLUNGE, or IMMERSE j and that in dis¬tinction from every other mode of washing, aswell as from sprinkling, or pouring, which Iare expressed, in the original, by other words :and that such is its meaning is evident from the Iexamples recorded. Jesus, having been bap¬tized in Jordan, “ went up out of the water,which shows he had been into it. Philip and the ieunuch had already come unto a certain water, !tve are told, “they went both down into the water,”that he might baptize him j and when this was nperformed, “they came up out of the water.” f.1hNow there was no need for mltfi watek, rricoiKG downt: INTO it, ir> order to pour orlsprinkle a little of it on the face.*We shall now briefly enquire to' whom tiiW;ordinance is to be administered. That only be¬lievers of the gospel are the proper subjects ofi baptism, appears evident from the words of the1 commission given to the apostles : There youwill notice, that tkaching precedes baptism;&nd in the parallel passage, it is preceded bybelieving, tBut if there were any ambiguity in the tenor’ of tl1e Commission, it is amply cleared up by theI subsequent practice of the apostles ; which we! find to be in perfect conformity to this law—I Veter began to preach the gospel to the Jews,on the day of Pentecost, and none but they“ who gladly received his word were baptized.t -Philip preached the gospel to the Samaritans,i and it was not till “ they believed the things! concerning the kingdom of God, and the namei of Jesus,” that they were baptized, “ both meni and women.” || See also the instances recorded! in Acts ii. 37- x. 4-7. xvi. 5. and 33.Such is the plain and concise account whichthe New Testament presents to us respectingthe mode and subjects of this Christian ordi¬nance ; and to a mind unprepossessed by thegeneral practice, unfettered by human authori¬ty, and able to read the Scriptures without biasor prejudice, it cannot but appear strange, thatI —T —  —"J-     • Mark i. 5. John iii. 23. f Mark xvi. 1C. J Acts u. -11.|| viii.*I2.oan opinion and corresponding practice has beenadopted by the great majority of Christians, com¬pletely opposed to these plain declarations of theword of God ; and that opinion, too, entertainedand defended by men of learning and piety, who,in every other matter regarding the will ofChrist, have clear and scriptural views ; but;who, in endeavouring to make the Scripturessuit their preconceived (but doubtless sincere)views on this subject, have obscured the meaningand perverted the design of an ordinance full ofimportant instruction to the believer ; nay, wewill venture to assert, that the arguments usedto establish their opinions, are subversive of afundamental principle in die chnstian system.fSee t page 8)Our limits will not permit any lengthenedexamination of those arguments by which Such(we will say) an unscriptural practice is sup¬ported ; we will nevertheless briefly notice someof them, and leave the reader to judge how farthey agree with Scripture authority on the subject.Though the advocates of infant-baptismgenerally acknowledge that there is neither“express precept” or “indisputable example”in the Word orGod, in support of it, yet they!,;think it may be established by analogy andinference. It certainly evinces a great pover¬ty of argument where nothing better can be pro¬duced. It is no less than a reflection on thewisdom of the institutor. Has he appointedan ordinauce to be observed by his followers, 11and does he leave them to the uncertain deduc- ■7fcions of analogy and inference to ascertain How,or by whom, it is to be observed ? It is absnrdto bring forward parts of Scripture which do notavail to warrant it. Baptism », clearly, a posi¬tive ordinance; not like watohal or moralduties, which may be inferred from the natureand relation of things, bat depending entirelyupon the will of Him who instituted it.At a very early period in the history of theChristian Church, we find an attempt was madeto engraft Jewish Institutions among the com¬mands of Jesus Christ. At the beginning ofthe 15th chapter of Acts we have, a remarkableinstance of this, and the decision then given liashappily done away all idea of the rite of circum¬cision being a condition of Salvation ; but still,this Judaical rite has nevertheless obtained a,strong hold over the minds of many, and some¬thing analogous, as to its subjects, has been sup¬posed necessary in the Christian rite of baptism ;and the warm appeals to fhe feelings and afifec-tions in behalf of infants, have doubtless tendedmuch to confirm the idea, (more especially inthe minds of those who have made little enquiryon the subject) that Baptism has, as to its sub¬jects, come in the room of Circumcision. This,however, is a mere gratuitous assertion, to whichthe Scriptures give no support whatever. Ithas indeed been with much seriousness urgedagainst those who hold adult baptism, that they“ cut off their infants from the everlastingcovenant.” If the enquiry is made as to whatcovenant they refer, it is readily defined to betl\at which the Apostle calls the New Cove¬nant ;* but if the enquiry be further made—Areany of the human race born with an interest inthis covenant ? an answer in the affirmative, it isevident, would be in direct opposition to whatthe Scripture testifies of the natural state of everyindividual.t That the Jews should boast oftheir derivative holiness, as descendants ofAbraham, was not very strange ; but this wefind the Baptist commands them to renounce,as of uo avail, and calls upon them to bringforth fruits meet for repentance, as well as thosewhom they accounted the vilest of societv. Hedescribes those who had power to become theSons of God, as being “born not of blood, norof the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man,^ut of God. t The Scripture hath concludedall under sin, that the promise by faith of JesusChrist might be given to them that believe.||They that are of faithThe same are the childrenof Abraham.§” These declarations are all instrict harmony with the testimony and promisecontained in the Commission,—“ he that be-lieveth shall be saved ;” and how it can bemade out, from such passages as these, that in¬fants are in “ a certain sense holy,” and, assuch the subjects of an ordinance designed toexhibit to the baptized the death, burial, andresurrection of Christ, and communion with,   .           -A__   * tial. lii. iv. f Psal. li. 5. Rom. iii. $ John i. 12. 13. !y»V'. ivrJ fl Gal. Hi. 22. § Gal. iii/7.9and conformity to him therein, seems to be q jiteihconceiveable.Jesus says, “ Suffer the little children to cnineunto me, and forbid them not ; for of such isdie kingdom of God.” From this it is argued,that since the infants of believers belong to thekingdom of God, they must have a right tobaptism'. ut this passage;does not distin¬guish the infants of believers from those of in¬fidels, nor conclude for^the baptism of the onemore than the other. The kingdom of Godto which little children are declared to" belong,is his real invisible kingdom, which will nottruly appear until Christ’s second coming ;* fork is that kingdom which none can enter butsuch as receive if as a little child,+ and arereally converted and born again. But there isno room for much reasoning on this passage.Either these infants were baptized, or they werenot. It they were, the controversy is at an end,if they were not, then they ought not. Thatthey Were not then baptized is evident; theywere not brouglui for that purpose, “ but that heshould put las hands on them and pray.”Jesus himself did not baptize them, for he bap¬tized none; nor did he order his disciples to doit ; nor would they have prevented them if theyliad known any thing about infant baptism. b;therefore, while Jesus was rebuking his disciple*for forbidding infants t > come unto him ; if,while he was declaring infants to be of Ins* 2 Tim. iv. 1, -J- Mark x. 15.r&w**,10kingdom ; taking them up in his artus andblessing them ; if while he had such a fair oppor¬tunity of being explicit as to their baptism, andof setting an example of it that might have pre¬vented all the disputes which he forsaw wouldarise ou that subject j but, if on such an occasion,he neither baptized them himself j nor com¬manded them to be baptized, nor so much asgave the least hint of his will that such shouldbe baptized in future ; what can we reasonablyinfer from all this, but that infant-baptism is noinstitution of his, nor was ever intended by him ?We may also learn from this passage what somedo not seem to understand, viz. that infants maybe acknowledged of Christ’s kingdom, broughtunto him, and obtain his blessing, without beingbaptized.Peter, addressing the convicted Jews, says,“ Repent and be baptized every one of you inthe name of Jesus Christ, for the remission ofa ns, and ye shall receive the gift of the HolyGhost, i'or the promise is unto you, and toyour children, and to all tliat are afar off, evenas many as the Lord our God shall call.”*Hence- it is pleaded. That since the promise ofsalvation is made unto the infant children of be¬lievers as well as to themselves, therefore theyought to be baptized.13ut thja argument is grounded upon a com¬plication of mistakes. The promise here re¬ferred to is not the promise of salvation in* Acts ii. 38. 39.11general, but the promise of the Spirit in partieu-lar, which he had before cited from Joel ii. 28—32* and which includes the extraordinarygifts which were peculiar to the first age of thegospel. This promise began to be accomplishedon the day of Pentecost, as the Apostle shows,verse 16, 33, and was made in the first placeto the Jews and their children. The childrento whom this promise is made must of necessi¬ty be the very same that are mentioned in thepromise itself, and who are there termed “ yoursons and your daughters and therefore cannotsignify infant children, for they are such asshould prophesy upon receiving the Spirit, aswe see was actually the case.-j-The Apostle says, “For the unbelieving hus¬band is sanctified by the wife, and the unbeliev¬ing wife is sanctified by the husband : else wereyour children unclean, but now are they holy.’TThe argument from this is, That as the childreneven of one believing parent are holy, as beingin covenant with God ; therefore they ought tohave the seal of that covenant in baptism.y Had this promi-e respected infant children, and been understoodas a warrant for their baptism, then they must have been immediatelybaptised with their parents : but we read of none receivi g baptismon this occasion, but such tjs gladly received Peter’s word, were thesame day added to the church, and continued gtedfastly in theapostles’ doctrine and fellowship, and in breaking of bread, and inprayers ;m even as the multitude baptized in Samaria are expresslydeclared to be beheving men and women, f It is the extremity offolly and perverseness to argue against plain facts.(•Acts ii. 41, 42.) (t Chap. vUi 12.)•Acts ii. 16—32 y Acts ii. 4. x. 46 xix. 6. and xxi. 9.I Cor. xii. 6 — 12. £ 1 Cor. viii. 14.12But the Apostle had no such thing in hiseye; nor would this sense of the passage havesuited his purpose, or have satisfied the scruplesot the believing Corinthians. Their questionwas not—Are our children possessed of new-covenant holiness, and so entitled to baptism ?but (as appears from the answer) it was this—May we lawfully retain our unbelieving wives,or must we put them away, as Old Israel wereobliged to do by the law of Moses ?* To thishe answers, “ If any brother hath a wifi# thatbelieveth not. and she be pleased to dwell withhim, let him not put her away,” &c. And hegives this reason for it, “For the unbelievingwife is sanctified by the husband,” Thissanctification of the unbelieving wife to thebeliever, being opposed to the legal uncleannessof an alien to a Jew, must relate purely to themarriage relation, and signify that she was alawful wife to him, even as the meats formerlyfield unclean by the law of Moses were nowsanctified to him, or made lawful for his use,tAnd what other sanctification or holiness can wesuppose an unbeliever, while such, capable of?lie farther observes, that unless their unbeliev¬ing wives were thus sTmctified, their childrenwould also be unclean. The uncleanness of |the children being stated as a consequence of the [jsupposed unlawfulness of the unbelieving party, Jmust necessarily signify illegitimacy j for athough they were begotten in marriage, yet 3!• Deiit. vii, 3. Ezra x. f 1 Tim, iv. 3—6.,131upon supposition that the marriage itself wereunlawful, they must of consequence have beenan unlawful issue. This holiness of tl>echildren can signify nothing more than legiti¬macy ; because it is opposed to their unclean¬ness, as above explained} and because it isstated as an effect of the sanctification of theunbelieving parent, without which, the Apostle| affirms, they would be unclean ; it must there¬fore be a holiness of the same kind ; for spiritualholiness can never depend upon, or flow from,the sanctification of an unbeliever. As the un¬believing party is sanctified, or made holy, onlyin respect of her being a lawful wife to thebeliever, so the children can have no holiness inconsequence of this, but that of being a law fulissue, which affords no argument for theirbaptism.We read that Lydia was baptized and“ her household that the Jiiiler “ wasbaptized, he and ail his, straightway ;t”mul tnat Paul “ baptized also the household ofI htephanas,£ i hese passages are urged asexhibiting examples o. baptizing infants, takingi for granted that those houses contained infantsWho were baptized upon thejfiuth of their parents.But this is only begging the question in de¬bate. It must first be proved that there wereinfants in the houses mentioned, fur there aremany houses without them : and though thiswere done, which it never can, it still remains to* Acts svi. 6, f Verse 33. * 1 Cor. I- J6.14be proved that they were baptized ; for tin; uni¬versal express!oh of “ all the house,” sornetiroeasignifies only the adult part of it.* But thescripture account of those baptized houses de¬monstrates that they were not infants. Allthe house of Cornelius “ feared God, and re¬ceived the Holy Ghost.f” Lydia’s householdwere comforted as brethren.:}: The wordof the Lord was spoken to all in the Jailer’shouse ;jj and they all rejoiced, believingin God as well as himself. § All the house olCrispus believed on the Lord,* and the houseof Stephanas “ addicted themselves to the ministryof the saints.t” Now if these things, whichare affirmed of all the baptized, will not apply1uuto infants, then it is plain there were no in-ifants baptized in those houses.In respect to the mode or manner oftBaptism, an argument for sprinkling, in op-rposition to immersion, has been drawn fro mithe blood of Christ having been thus said to bt«applied to the soul. We can hardly be per-jfsuaded, that those tvho use this argument, wilseriously assert, that there is a material applicatiou jof the Redeemer’s blood to the souls even oibelievers, although their language indicates something of this kind, when they say. “ if the blooiof bulls—sprinkling the unclean sanctifieth,is not the blood of Christ sufficient, when applied “ the same way,” to purge the conscience!Judges ix. (5. + Acts x. 2, 44, 47.J Ver. 33. § Acts xvi. 34. • Chap, xviii. 8.J Acts xvi. 40U*iJ-|- 1 Gor. xW, 1ft' •15fhe apostleS speak of the sprinkling of thellood of Jesus Christ, of the blood of sprinkling-vhich speaketh better things than that of Abel.But this language is highly figurative j aad hethat would interpret it literally, would not only>rofane the holy scriptures, but conceal the■tand and glorious truth intended to be cocveywd.rhis language i® borrowed from the law, mids designed to shew that in Christ, as the endif the law for righteousness to every on# thatxdieveth, every prefiguration of him is fulfilled}hat the Israelites had the shadow, but that-hristians have the substance. To contend thatthe mode of baptism is to be sought for i» thelanguage of the law, figuratively applied to thesacrifice of Christ and its glorious effects, is ashsurd as to seek for the living among the dead.Because his blood is spoken of as sprinkled, is iti fair conclusion, that this is the pattern forbaptizing ? This is founding it upon a mereingle of words. Where do we find the leastgithority for the doctrine, that because the atone¬ment is Represented by various figures, thereforebaptism must be au external representation ofthese figures ? Besides, in none of the passagoRquoted is there the least mention of water bap¬tism, except in Heb. x. 22. and here it » the“ bathing of the body with pure water,” Toleek for the mode of baptizing where it is not somuch as spoken of, is a strange way of ebtahlieh-ing a plain institution, and shows the sophistrythat is necessary to support an aujfejmdedprtictice.16Having considered the Mode and Subjects oBSptism, we come now to shew what is its impout and design',—and this is a branch ofth.subject but too little attended to. The univurs;practice of sprinkling infants, with the arguments used in support of that human inventionhave, in a great measure obscured its signification ; so that it is amazing to observe the i^mcranee of professors on this head. Amongst thvarious views entertained as to this,—some conoeive it to be a christening, or making ihenChristians ; hence their anxiety to have thensprinkled betimes, lest they should die pagansOthers, again, view it as a sign whereby theiinfants are initiated into the visible churchthough they are neither agreed as to what thachurch is, nor admit them into the full communion of any Visible church. If we consul!the word of God, we shall find that this divinordinance is intended to be a sign of regeneraTltJN, or that the person baptized is born ofthSpirit. Jesus says to Nicodemus,—Exceptrnan be born of Water and of the Spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of God. Wateihere undoubtedly means the water of baptismfor it is distinguished from the Spirit j so thato be born of water, is to be baptized, eveias to be “ born of the Spirit,” is to be regene:rated ; and as the former is connected with thfilatter, and termed a birth in reference to it, nmust he the visible sign or representation of thJtspiritual birth. This is farther evident frorioTitus iii. 5, This ordinance also represents t i17l the repenting believer, the remisMon or washingi away of his sins in the blood of Christ. Aeeord-|in,2fly Peter exhorts the convicted Jews,— Repentand be baptized every one of vou in the name ofJesus Christ for the remission of sins. In Act*xxii. If). Ananias in his address to Paul ex¬presses tin's still stronger. This manner of(speaking will appear very extravagant to manyi-now-a-day:., who 1< ok upon baptism as a mereempty nte or arbitrary precept.*Baptism exhibits the death, buriat, andiresurrection of Christ, whereby he fulfilledall righteousness, together with the Christian’s'(communion with, and conformity to himtherein. I ho Apostle expressly declares andchiefly insists upon this, in Rom. vi. 4. andCol. ii. 12. to which the reader is requested toiturn. i hese passages exhibit to us in a figure,what the gospel declares by way of Testimony :tnat Christ was delivered tor our offences, andiwas raised again for our justification, t Thisiis what was represented‘by his own baptism,ias appears from the reason he assigns to John,—r Suffer it to he so now ; for thus it becovnethus to fulfill all righteousness.”Our limits will not permit entering fartherInto this branch of the subject ; but those whowish to enquire into it more largely, may con¬sult with much profit the late Mr A. MTean’sillustration of the Commission, (Trorn which the■greater part of these pages have been extracted j)• 1 Peter iii. 21.•f Rom iv. 25.18ako Inmes’ “Eugenio and Epenetus,” where tluarguments on each side of the question are withmuch candour discussed; or Cox “on Baptism,’in which the reasonings of modern writers irdefence of Infant Baptism are'replied to.We come now to consider that teaching whiel:has for its object baptized disciples, gatheredout of the nations ; and we have in a preceding i'Bract considered some of Christ’s commandments to them as individuals, and shall proceeqto notice some others whiph they are to ohservtin their united capacity, and in a state of separation from the world. It is not meant that theyshould withdraw7 themselves from human societywhich would be to render themselves useless iithe World, Our Lord and his apostles kep sup a free converse with mankind.* Christian iare members of civil society, and ought to buseful and exemplary in the discharge of tfr iduties which belong to their different stations am trelations therein. But the separation from th jworld which the word of God enjoins Chrisrtians, is to break off all religious connectioilwith such as do not appear to be real believer»in Christ, and subject to his authority,—havin. :ia form of godliness but denying its poxver.From such the solemn call to the people (God is “ to turn away,—Come out of her wfipeople, that ye be not partakers of her plagues.

Atpresent it is invisible to us, and will not appearuntil Christ’s second coming. It is to the visiblemembers of this church that baptism belongs.The word also signifies a particular congre¬gation of visible believers, with its bishops (i. e.iclders) and deacons, regularly assembling in oneplace, for the performance of religious worship,and the observation of Christ’s institutions.—It signifies a single congregation : such wasithe church at Jerusalem, Antioch, &c.—Each•of these societies were composed of visible be-.lievers, or such as by their profession andiwalk appeared to be saints and faithful.* Ithad a plurality of elders or bishops to ruleand labour in the word and doctrine ;f and alsot.f deacons to take care of the poor and serveitables t—It regularly assembled in one PLACE.Ii • l Cor. i. 2.

Such a church, withits office-bearers, is an organized body, completein all its parts,* and has the full power of government and discipline within itself. It is a visiblrepresentation of Christ’s true catholic church,which is at present invisible, and therefore isdesigned by the same epithets, such as God’sbuilding, habitation, temple, house, Christ’sbody, spouse, &e. t To such a church werethe ordinances delivered, t as also the instituteddiscipline ; || and it is only in such a societyseparated from the world, that they can be ob¬served according to their primitive institutionThis union of believers is represented in theScriptures, as being a connection of the mostclose and intimate kind,—a union, which, wherformed is not to f.-j dissolved but upon groundthe most important.

That it is a solemn institution no believeri will question j for every service connected with theI duty and worship we owe to God as our Creator, ourii preserver, and merciful redeemer, must be solemn andimportant; but it will be found, that in so far a» ~wei exalt any particular religious duty, we are very muchi in danger of depreciating others. The Lord's Supperhas been distinguished as the mcM solemn approachto God, as a sealing ordinance, or devoting ourselyOs■ to the Lord, Nothing of this kind is indicated in the: Scriptures. If we turn to that institution in the OldI Testament, the Pas&ovhh, which is considered asanalogous to that in the New Testament, we find itwas expressly appointed to commemorate that deli¬verance granted to the Israelites, when the destroying1 Angel passed through the land of Egypt, and slew allthe first born of the Egypti a^g. In like manner Jesus■wrought out a great .deliverance Ibr his people, in>e-i deeming them from the curse of that law which th*yI had broken. In the character of the sinner’s substi-* tute. he obeyed the law in all it precepts : he magni-‘ fied it and made it honourable, and brought in aneverlasting righteousness, in which Jehovah i» well; pleased, and by which the ungodly are justified, llieLoad knew the hearts of his disciples, he knew hbwreadily they might forget him and his work,—«jd bej knew also, that unless they kept them in meihbry,they neither would lire by him nor to him; thereforei he appointed this ordinance, not for any complex ori mystical design, but, simply as a remembrancer of hisl dying love.This ordinance, like Baptism, has been awfully per-; verted by superstitien; and like it has been deeplyinvolved in obscurity and error. Within the courseI of a few centuries, we find the simple rite of an asseravi bly of Christiana eating bread and drinking wine, itt 4grateful commemoration of the expiatory sufferingsand death of Christ, converted into a splendid andIn the church of Rome, onecomplicated ceremony,deviation produced another, till the Lord’s supper ended in the idolatrous sacrifice °f the mass. In Pro¬testant countries it is still called a sacrament. It isobserved so seldom by many calling themselves Chris¬tian churches, and attended to with so many appenda¬ges of preaching days, &c. that every unprejudiced!person, iq, comparing such, practices with what theftfew Testament sajs concerning it,.would at oncerpronounce,'in tfie words of Paul, “ This is not to eatthe Lord’s Supper.” s; cThey likewise continued stedfastly in the prayers.Prayer is also a solemri service, inasmuch as it is anaddress presented unto God in the name of Christ, !the great Iligh-pri^t fi^.id Advocate, through whose-mediation alone thfere 4a access unto the throne olgrace with accepfeVce.

j1 cannot blame him because he is constant,True love is better than silver or gold.A costly jewel she instantly gave him.Then in her trembling hand took a knife;One fatal stroke, before they could save her.Quickly did put an end to her life.Great lament was made for this lady,Jemmy on board the ship he did steer:Unto old England he homeward came sailing,With a longing desire to meet with his dear.But when her father heard he was returning,He wrote a letter to the boatswain, his friend.Saying a handsome reward I will give you,If you the life of young Jemmy will end.Void of all mercy, and for sake of the money,The cruel boatswain the same did complete ;As they upon the deck one day were walking,He suddenly tumbled him into the deep.PART HI.IN dead of the night, when all were asleep,His troubled ghost to his love did appear,Crying, arise my beautiful Nancy,Perform the vow that you made to your dear.You are my own, therefore tarry no longer;Seven long years for your sake I did stay ; 'Hymen doth wait for to crown us with pleasure.The bride-guests are ready, then come away.•She cry’d, who’s there, under my window ?Surely it is the voice of my dear!Lilting her head from her soft downy pillow,Straight to the casement she did repair.7By iight of the moon which brightly was shiningShe spy’d her love, who to her did say,Your parents are sleeping, before they awake,Stir, my dear creature, and come away.O Jemmy, she cry’d, if my father should hear.We both shall be ruin’d, I pray thee repairUnto the sea-side, I'll- there meet with you ;With my two maids I’ll meet with you there.Her night-gown embroider’d with gold & silver.Carelessly round her body she instantly throws.With her two maids who did attend her,To meet her lover she instantly goes.Close in her arms did the spirit enfold her,Jemmy, she said, you are colder than clay !Sure you’re not the man that I did admire ;Paler than death you appear unto me.Yes, fairest creature, I am your true love ;Dead or alive you know you’re my own !I come for thy vow, my dear, you must followMy body now to a watery tomb.I, for your sake, refus’d gold and silver ;Beauty and riches for you I despised *,A charming lady for me did expire -,For thinking on you I was deaf to her cries.Your cruel Parents have been my undoing,And now l do sleep in a watery grave -,Now for thy promise, my dear, lam shewing,Dead or alive now you I must have.PART IV.THE trembling Lady was sorely affrighted ?Arnazed she stood near the brink of the sea !With eyes lifted up, she cry’d, cfud parents,May you be requited for your cruelty.8She then cry’d aloud, my dear, I am comingNow into thy bosom I'll soon fall asleep !When she had thus spoken, this unfortunate LadiSuddenly plung’d herself into the deep.When to her father the maidens thus told !He wrung his hands, saying, what have I don.Oh 1 dearest child, it was thy cruel fatherThat did provide thee a watery tomb. !Two or three days being then expired,These two unfortunate Lovers were seenIn each other’s arms on the waves a-floating.By the side of the ship on the watery main.The cruel boatswain was struck with horror*Straight did confess the deed he had done,Shewing the letter which came from her fatherWhich was the cause of those lovers doom.On board of ship he was tried for the murdeiAnd at the yard’s arm was hang’d for the samerHer father he soon brake his heart for his daughtiBefore that the ship into the harbour came.Thus cursed gold has caused distraction.Why should the rich covet still after gain ?I hope this story it will be a warning,That cruel parents may ne’er do the same.True love is better than jewels or treasure ;Riches can never buy true love I know;But this young couple lov’d out of measure,Love was the cause of their overthrow.%PIN IS.

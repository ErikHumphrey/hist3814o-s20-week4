I.Of his Birth, Parentage, and Education.In the reign before William theconqueror, I h rve heard in ancient his¬tory that there dwelt a man in theparish of the Isle of Ely, in the conn-4ty of Cambsid^e, whose name wasThomas Hickathrift, a poor man anda day labourer, yet he was a verystout man, and able to { erform twodays work instead of one : He havingone son, and no more children in theworld, he called him by his own name,Thomas Hickathrih, This old manput his son to good-learnings but hewould take none, for he was as we callthem in this age,- none of the wisestsort but something less, and had nodocility at »His father being soon cal'ed opt ofthe world, his mother was tender ofhim, maintained him by her hand-la¬bour as well as ske eauld ; he beingslothful, and not willing to work toget a penny for his living, but all hisdelight was to be in the chimney cor¬ner, - and would ,^at as much at onetime as would serve four or five men ;fafiJhd tti&b in dieight, when he wasbnt? ten years of age, about eight feetand in thickness live feet, and hishand was like unto a shoulder of23mutton ; and in all his parts fromtop to toe, he was like unto a mon¬ster, and yet his great strength wasnot known.idCHAP. II.How Tkom'Xs Hickathri/ls Strength cameto be known.The first time that his strength wasknown, was by his mother going toa rich farmer’s house (she being buta poor woman) to desire a bottle ofstra*v to shift herself ami her sonThomas. The farmer being a veryhonest, charitable man, bill her takewhat she would. She going hometo her s6ne Tom, said, I pray go tosuch a place and fetch me a bottle ofstraw, i have asked him leave, Heswore he would not go: nay, praythee, Tom go, sai l his old mother.He swore again he would not go, un¬less she would borrow him a cirtrope. She being willing to pleasehim, went and borrowed him a cartrope to his desire.He taking it went his way; comingto the farmer’s house, the master wasin the barn, and two men threshing.Said Tom, I am come for a bottle ofstraw. Tom, said the master, takeas much as thou canst carry. Helaid down the cart rope, and beganto make his bottle ; said they, Tomthy rope is to short, and jeer’d poorTom, but he fitted the man well forit : for he made his bottle, and whenhe had finished it, there was supposedto be a load of straw in it, of twothousand weight. Said they, what agreat fool art thou, thou canst notcarry the tenth of it ? Tom took thebottle and flung it over his shoulder,and made no more of it than we doof an hundred weight, to the greatadmiration of master and men.Tom Hickathrift’s strength beingthen known in the town, they wouldno longer let him lie baking by thefire in the chimney corner, every one237would be hiring him to work : Theyseeing hirn to have so much strength,told him that it was a shame for himto live such a lazy course of life, andto lie idle day after day, as he did.Tom seeing them bait him in amanner as they did, went first to onework then to another; but at lengthcame a man, who would hire him togo to the wood ; for he had a tree tobring home, and he would contenthim. Tom went with him, and hetook with him four men besides;but when they came to the wood,they set the cart on the tree, and be¬gan to diaw it up with pullies; Tomseeing them not able to stir it, said,stand away, ye fools, then takes it upand sets it on one end, and lays it onthe cart; Now, says he, see what aman can do. Merry is it true, saidthey. When they had done, as theycame through the would they met thewood-man, Tom asked him for astick to make his mother a fire with.Aye, says the wood-man, take oneI'T' r • t • •r f rthat thou canst carry. Tom espyeda tree bigger than the one that wasin the cart, and lays it on his shoul¬der, and goes home with it as fast asthe cart and six horses could draw it.This was the second time that Tom’sstrength was known.When Tom began to know that hehad more strength than twenty men,he then began to be merry and verytractable, and would run, or jump,took great delight to be amongst com¬pany, and to go to fairs ami meetings,to see sports and pastimes.Going to a feast, the young menwere all met, some to cudgels, someto wrealing, isome throwing’the ham¬mer and theTi^e ; Tom stood a whileto see the sport, and at last goes tothem that were throwing the ham¬mer; and standing a little to see theirman-like sport, at last he takes thehammer in his hand to feel the weightof it, arid bid them stand out of theway, for he would throw it as far ashe could. Aye, said the smith and9<23jeered poor Tom, you’ll throw it agreat way I’ll warrant 3011 ; Tom tookthe hammer in his hand and flung- it;and their was a river about fn;e orsix furlongs off and flung it intothat: When he had done, he bid thesmith fetch the hammer again, andlaughed the smith to scorn.When Tom hail done this exploit,he would go to the wrestling, tho’ hehad no more skill of it than an ass,but what he had by strength ; yet heflung all that came to oppose him, forif once he laid hold of them, theywere gone. Some he would throwover his head, some he would laydown silly, and how he pleased ; hewould not like to strike at their heels,but flung them two or three yardsfrom him, ready to break their necksasunder ; so that none at last durstgo into the ring to wrestle with him,for they took him to be some devilthat was come among them; soTom’s fame soon spread more andmore in the country.10CHAP. III.Hovt Tom came to be a Brewer’s man ; and hotchorn he came to hill a Giant, aud at last wasMr Hickathrift.TOM’s fame being spread abroadboth far and near, there was not aman durst give him an angry wordfor he was something fool-hardy, anddid not care what he did unto them;so that all them who knew him wouldnot in the least displease him. Atlength there was a brewer at Lynn,who wanted a good lusty man to carryhis beer to the marsh, and to Wis¬bech ; hearing of Tom, went to hirehim, but Tom seemed coy, and wouldnot be his man, until his mother andfriends persuaded him, and his mas¬ter intreated him ; likewise promisedhim that he should have a new suitof clothes and every thing answerableIrom top to toe; besides he shouldeat and drink of the best. Tom atlast yielded to be his man, and his11f Ifmaster told him how far he mastgo; for you must understand therewas a monstrous giant, who keptsome part of the marsh, and durstnot go that way; for if they did, hewould keep them, or kill them; orelse he would make bond slaves ofthem.But to come to Tom and his mas¬ter, he did more work in one day,than all his men could do in three ;so that his master seeing him verytractable, and to look so well afterhis business, made him his head manto go into the marsh, to carry beerby himself, for he needed no manwith him. Tom went every day inthe week to Wisbech, which was avery good journey, and it was twentymiles the road way,Tom going so long that wearisomejourney and finding that way whichthe giant kept was nearer by half,and Tom before by being so wellkept, and drinking so much strongale as he did j one day he was going12to Wisbech, and without saying anything to his master, or to any of hisfellow servants, he was resolved totake the nearest way to the wood ; orlose his life to win the horse, or losethe saddle, to kill or be killed, if hemet with the giant; and with thisresolution he goes the nearest waywith his cart anil horses to go toWisbech, but the giant perceivinghim, and seeing him to be so bold,thought to prevent him, and came in¬tending to take ids cart from him.rite g-iant met l orn like a lion, asthough he would have swallowed himup at a morthful; Sirrah, says he, whogave you authority to come this way?Do you not know that I make allstand in fear of my sight, and youlike an impudent rogue must comeand fling open my gates at yourpleasure ! flow dare you presume todo this ? Are you so careless of yourlife ? 1 will make thee an example forall rogues under the sun ; dost thounot care what thou dost? And doyou not see how many heads hangupon yonder tree that have offendedme! But thy head shall hang higherthan all the rest for an example.Tom made answer, A turd in yourteeth for your news, for you shallnot find me like one of them. No,said the giant, why ? Thou art buta fool if thou comest to fight withsuch a one as I am, and bring noweapon to defend thyself withal.Said Tom, I have a weapon here willmake you understand you are a traitor-ily rogue. Aye sirrah said the Giant,and took that word in high disdain, thatTom should call him a traitorily rogue,and with that he ran into his cave tofetch his club, intending to dash outTom's brains at the first blow.Tom knew not what to do far a wea¬pon, for he knew his whip would dobut little good against such a monstrousbeast as he was, for he was in heightabout twelve feet, and six feet aboutthe waist; but while the Giant wentfor his club, Tom bethought himself of14two very good weapons, for he makesno more ade, but takes out the axle-tree, and a wheel for his shield andbuckler ; and very good weapons theywere, especially in time of need.The Giant, coming out again, beganto stare at Tom, to see him take thewheel in one hand and axle-tree inthe other to defend himself with. O!said the Giant, you are like to do greatservice with these weapons; I havehere a twig that will beat thee and thywheel and axle-tree to the ground;that which the Giant called a twig wasas thick as some mill-posts are, butTom was not daunted tor all his bigand threatening speeches, for he sawperfectly there was no way except one,which was, to kill or be killed ; so theGiant made at Tom with such a vehe¬ment force, that he made Tom’s wheelcrack again, and Tom lent the Giantas good, for he gave him such a weigh¬ty blow on the side of his head, thatmade the Giant reel again. What saidlo ibeuJd idstiodtod mo'i .duly eid loiTom are you drunk with my stong beeralready.The Giant recovering laid on Tommost sad blows ; but still as they came,Tom kept them off with his wheel, sothat he had no hurt of all: In short,Tom piled his work so well, and laidsuch huge blows on the Giant, thatsweat and blood together ran down hisface and being fat and foggy ; withfighting so long, he was almost tiredout, and asked Tom to let him drinka little water, and then he would fightwith him again, No, said Tom, mymother did not teach me that wit; whowould be the fool then ? Tom findingthe Giant began to weary, and that hefailed in his blows, thought it was bestto make hay while the sun did shine,for he laid on so fast as though he wasmad, till he brought the Giant downto the ground. The Giant seeing him¬self down, and Tom laying so hard onhim, made him roar in a most lament¬able manner, and prayed for him notto take away his life, and he would do16any thing for him, and yield himself tohim and be his servant; but Tomhaving no more mercy on him than adog or bear, laid still a) the Giant, Tillhe laid him for dead and when he haddone he cut of his head and went intothe cave, where lie found a great storeof silver and gold which made hisheart to leap.Now having done this action, killingthe Giant he put his cart togetheragain, loded it and drove it to wisbechand delivered his beer ; and cominghome to his master, he told it to him ;his master was so overjoyed at the news,that he would not believe bin till hehad seen ; and getting up the next day,he and his master went to see if hespoke truth or not together with mostof the town of Lynn. When they cameto the place and found the Giant dead,he then shewed the place where hishead was, and what silver and goldthere was in the cave, all of themleaped for joy for this monster was agreat enemy to all the country.This news was spread all up anddown the country how lorn Hickathrifthad killed the Giant, and well was hethat could run or go to see the Giantand the cave ; then all the folks madebonfires for joy ; and Tom was bettera respected man than before.Tom took possession of the giant’scave by consent of the whole conpany,and every one said he was deservedtwice as much more ; Tom pulleddown the cave, built him a fine housewhere the cave stood ; and the groundthat the giant kept by force andstrength, some of which he cave to thepoor for their common, the rest hemade pastures of and divided the mostpart into tillige, to maintain him andand his mother Jane Hickathrift.Tom’s fame was spread both far andnear through the country ; and it wasi no longer Tom but Mr. HicTathrift;i so that be was now the chiefest manamong them ; for the people fearedTom’s anger as much as they did thegiant before Tom kept men andmaid servants, and lived most bravely ;he made a park to keep deer in ; nearto his house he built a church andtfave it the name of St. James’s church,because he killed tne giant on that day,which is so called to this hour: Hedid many more good deeds, and becamea public benefactor to all persons thatlived near him.CHAP. IV.Htr.v Tom kept a pack of Hounds: His Kickinga Foot-ball quite away : Also boxv he had liketo hove been robbed by Four Thieves, and howhe Fisc aped.TOM having got so much moneyabout him, and not being used to it;could hardly tell how to dispose of it,but yet he did use means to do it; forhe kept a pack of hounds, and men tohunt with him; and who but Tom then.So he took such delight in sports, that1923.he wouhl go far and near to meetings,as cudgel-play, bear-baiting, foot-balland the like.Now Tom was riding one day, helighted off his horse to seethe sport,for they were playing for a wager ;Tom was a stranger and none did knowhim there ; but Tom soon spoiled theirsport; for he meeting the foot-ball, tookit such a kick that they never foundtheir ball more; they could see it fly,but whither none could tell; they allwondered at it, and began to quarrelwith Tom ; but some of them got no¬thing by it; for Tom got a spar, whichbelonged to a house that was blowndown, and all that stood in his way heknocked down, so that all the countryAvas up in arms to take Tom ; but all invain, for he manfully made way wher¬ever he came.When he was going from them, andreturning homewards, he chanced to besomewhat late in the evening; on theroad, their met four stout lusty ruguesthat had been robbing passengers that20way ; and none could escape them, forthey robbed all they met with, bothrich and poor. They thought whenthey met with Tom he would be a goodprize for them ; perceiving that he wasalone made cocksure of Ids money,but they were mistaken, for he got aprize of them. Whereupon meetingwith him, they bid him stand and de¬liver. What, said Tom,shall I deliver?Your money sirrah, said they. But,said Tom. you will give me betterwords for it, and you must be betterarmed. Come, come, said they, we donot come here to prate, but we comefor money, and money we will have,before you stir from this place. Aye,said Tom, is it so, nay then get it, andtake itSo one of them made at him ; buthe presently unarmed him, and tookaway his sword, which was made ofgood trusty steel, and smote so hard atthe others, that they began to put spursto their horses and begone ; but hesoou stayed their journey, for one ofei -them having a portmanteau behind himiTom supposing there was money in it,fought with a great deal of more cour¬age than before, till at last he killedtwo of the four, and the other two hewounded very sore, so that they criedout for quarters, and with much ado he: gave them their lives, but took alltheir money, which was about two hun¬dred pounds, to bear his expenses1 home. Now when Tom came home,I he told them how he had served thei four highway mono w hich caused aI laughter from hisoW mother ; then re-freshing himself, went to see how allli things were, and; what his men hadj done since lie went from home.•Then going up into hi.s forest, hewalked up and down, and at last metI with a lusty l inker, that had a good1 staff on his shoulder, and a great dog;to carry his leather bag and tools toj work. l orn asked the l inker whencehe come and whither he was going, forthat was no high-way : But the Tin¬ker, being a sturdy fellow, bid him goItI22Cheer then, Soldier, ’midst afflictionBright’ning joys will aften shine ;Virtue aye claims heaven’s protection, —Trust to providence divine!‘ . 7  :—  —Sweet as Rosebank’s woods and river,Coo], when summer’s sunbeams dart,Cam’ ilk word, and cooled the feverThat lang burned at Willie's heart.Silent slept he pn, poor fallow,Listening to his guide before,Owre green knowe and gowany hallovr,Till he reached the cot-house.Laigh it was, yet sweet, though humble,Deck'd wi' hinnysuckle round ;Clear below Esk‘s waters rumble.Deep glens murmuring back the sound.Melville's towers, sae white and stately.Dim by gloaming glint to view ;'i hro' Lasswade's dark woods keek sweetlySkies sae red and lift sae blue !Entering now, in transport mingleMither fond and happy wean,Smiling round a happy ingle,Blessing on a clean hearth-stone.Soldier, welcome !—come be cheery— 5Here ye'se rest, and take your bed—Faint, waes me ! ye seem, and weary.Pale's your cheek, sae lately red.A'S23; lij —I . -if.b !:• —jf;3n io.i Sf-)Changed I am, sighed Willie till her,Changed, .nae doubt, as changed can be :Yet, alas, does Jeanie MillerNought of Willie Gairlace see ?—I ^93 eirf bsqi'v .o'nin’.-hnd -7Ha’e ye marked the dews of morningGlittering in the sunny ray,Quickly fa’, whan, without warning,Rough blasts cam’ and shook the spray.SjLbsrifenorto hrm—bnoodo—botioqqrja ,Vi«i1 Ha’e you seen the bird fast fleeingDrap, when pierced by death mail fleet ?Then see Jean, wi’ colour deeing,i Senseless drap at Willie’t feet.stnqa ^nivisa eomii ompril| After three king years’ affliction,(Af their waes now hushed to rest,)I, Jean ance mair, in fond affection,Clasps her Willie to her breast.b b > .

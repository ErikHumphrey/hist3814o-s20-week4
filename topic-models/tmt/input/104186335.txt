ILieutenant GEORGE SPEARIAG.l ^ ' ’■? % > X jlnN W ednwdny la^t, between tbe hours of X ^htul 4 o'clock afternoon, I went into a litth?wood, caJled Northvv-oodskle, situated betweculi and miles to the south-west of Glasgow, ,■,nt% a design to gather a few haze! nuts.—I lta<l ,ttot been in t he, vyc-od above 15 minutes, nor gat- iherttd more than fen huts, before I unfortunately .ihll into an old coal pk* ex?etly 51 feet deep, ;v;hieh had Ixhjh made through a solid rock. Os*iStxjvering my reeolieetion, ! found mysilf sir- itjng tsear-iy as a tailor dees at his work, the blooddowiog very fast front my mouth. 1 thought (bad ‘broken a blood vessel, and consequently,, ibad not long to live; hut, to my great comfort;, 'i soon discovered that the blhod proceeded frt>u; Ia wound in my tongue, which I supposed I hadbitten in my tali. Looking at my watch, it waston minutes past four; eml getting up,, I surrcyed !xny 'tintb-'i, and, to my inespressmle joy, fovudthat not one of them was broken. I was soon r - |ftroejied *o my situation, having from my chin*- lImod thought that something very extraordimu v ,was to uappeji wo in the, «swr?e of my Jtfb* a ad 5V- ,d utrt ine •feast doubt u relieved ui thensormog: for, the wood being but sma’l, and sit- ;i?,.ted noar a po^akus city, k la iiitltu fnquenr'-ucaj&cially yy tl'.e n\i,trseason,atjd there are sevm!{’oGt^athii leading through it.Night approached^ wjhen it to mm, notio geiit.'e sbojweM, but in torrents, such as at theautua.aal ra iinox. The pit was about 5 feet hidiameter, but not haviag been worked for severalyears, the subterraneous passages were chunkedtip, with small intermissions, tid the day of myrelease, and in a very short time 1 was ail overwet.In this com fort!css condition i endomwod totake seme repose. \ forked s? iek which I found, in the pit, l placed di tgvmaSiy to t-he side of it,' which served alteniately to support my head as ar pillow, or my body occasionally, which was muchi bruised; but, in the whole time 1 remained he: e,i| I do not think that ever I slept an hour together.|j Having passed a very disagreeable and tediousI night, I was somewhat cheered with the appear¬ance of day light, and the melody of a robin- rt-hreast, that had perched directly over the mouthof the pit; and this pretty little warbler continuedto visit my quarters every morning during myccmfinement; which I construed into & happy e-^:en of my deliverance. And J. •sinccreSy- Ueiieveithe trust I had iu Providence, and ihe iroaapsuyof this little bird, eontribnied.raaeh tothjt scT*n--isr of mind I constantly enjoyed- At the distaneeof about a hundred yards, in o direct line fr.amthe pit; there was a nntor-iniH, the Toiller's heu?©Wits nearer to me, and the’road t© the mill Wasstill nearer; so thatH could Ircq-ae^tiy ''-cur thehars-cs going ©u the road tv end flam ihc l£ iC 4 tw^uently I hei^rd human voices; and l eouI»dutinc-Ijpheartlieducks iind hens about the miMJ'rtiado the best use tf my voice on every becasionit was to no manner of’^urposc; for the wm-i,v. hicti was constantly liigh,* hi-eW in a line frommill to the pit, U-hich easily accomitsdbr'wltat1 invud; asid-f at tlie same time, nry v«iee wascwded the contrary way.I cannot say i suffered nuVch from hunger;affor two or three days my appetite ceased, butmy thirst was intolerable; atjd though it almostconstantly rained yet I could not, till the third orfourth day preserve a drop of it, as the earth atthe bottom of the pit sucked ii up as fast as it ranon***. In this distress I sucked my clothes ; butvom them 1 could extract but little moisture,The shock 1 received in the fall together with thedislocation of one of my ribs, kept me, I imaginein a oontimial fever; 1 cannot otherwise accountlor my suffering so much mere irom thirst than.1 did from hunger. At last I discovered the thighbone of a bull almost covered with earth, whichi was afterwards informed, fell into the pit 18years before me. I dug it np, and the large endof it left a cavity that, i suppose, might contain, quart. This the water gradually dnuomd into,but so very slowly, that it was a eontidewibi© lia^eof ore I could dip a nutshell foil at a ti«©s, whichi emptied into tire palm of my hand, and so drunkit > The water how began to increase pretty fas*,>o that I was very glad to enlarge my reservoir,wisp much, that on the 4thordth day, I h&d a sutlTif ettf supply i a«d this water was certainly thep; esei vatiou of my Kti\At the bottotM oftire pit there were grentM& of reptiles, sueli as frogs;- toads, Jargo b&tfc*waiis , or slugs ; &c. These noS‘ious t-iesriu-rs»»enfl frequently crawl about me, and tfren:%;etiintn mv reservoir; nevertheless, 1 t bought ft tin-sweetest water I had ever tasted ; end, at'tlnstuitce of tone, the retnembranee of it is so sw etr; ■Wrar, were it now passible to obtain any of it, Iam sure I could swallow it with avidity. ■ havefrequently taken both frogs and toads out of urueek, where, I suppose they took shelter while Vslept. The toads I always destroyed; but tlie fi eg*I eurefuliy preserved, as I did not, know bul lw-ight be under the necessity of eating them,-us »should not have scrupled to have done, k id Ibeen very hungry.Saturday the Oth, there fell but iitlle rain, and1 had the satisfaction to hear the voices of so toel*oys in the wood, luimedialoiy 1 called out withail my might, but it was all in vain, .hough l.af-terwards learned that they actually heard me; butJ etrg [Repossessed with an idle story, of a wildman being in the wood, they ran away very wsuchterrified.Sunday the 17th was my huth <iay, whoa I•oiapleted my 41st year; and i think it was thenext day that some of my acquaintance, having*accidentally heard that I had gone the way 1 did,4P»fc two or.threo porters out purposoly to searchthe pits for me. These men wentto the miikVskis^se, and made enquiry for eu? ; bat, oa*mnt of the groat rasa at the time, they nevere&tered the wOt'd, b«t eraaliy returned to theiremployers, teilmg s&tgn th-.-y -feu jvfuehed Sitefend tTiat I was not to be found. Ma»jpeople in my dismal situation would have die -i mdespair; but, 1 thank God, I enjoyed a perfectserenity of *ni*id; so ranch so, that on the Tues*day afternoon, and when S had been six night?hi the pit, 1 very composedly, by nay of amuse¬ment, fell to combing my w.g upon my knee,humming a tune, and thinking on Archer inthe play caiud the Beaux Stratagem.At- lejigth the morning, .September ‘iOth, thehippy morning for my deliverance came! a day,,that while,niy menmry lasts, 1 will always cele¬brate with gratitude to heaven.- Through thebrambles an ! bushes that covered the mouth ofthe pit, 1 could ditOQ .er the sun shining bright,and my pretty warbler was chanting his melodi¬ous strains, when my attention was roused by aeoiifused noise of human voices, which seemedlobe approaching fast towards the pit. Immedi¬ately I calk'd.out, and most agreeably surprised,many of my acquaintance, were.in search of me.As soon as they heard my voice, they all runWvv«rds the pit, and 1 could distinguish a ws*known voice exclaim, ‘Good God! he.is stiltliving. ‘ Anotlier oftb»si, a very honest NorthBriton, betwixt his surprise and joy, eouhi n#thelp asking wc, in ike iiibernmn style, il l wasstill living ? i ealkd oct that 1 was, and heart;too ; and then gave them particular direeUetahow to proceed in getting me eat.bdi tuuuteiy, at that juncture, -a ( oKev bolerg-higU? a working pit in the utdghhourhood, wfeNpa«.j.i'igalong ttie-raadi and heaving the uunstta-iiso fy Ac ly-ifid, cuvkAty led hire, ia(1)mto the cause ©fit; by hi. assistance, and a rcjsevchich wac tlievi procuvcrl from the mill, i n^assoen safely landed on terra fa raa (continents:K'uin land).

Almost iliefirst question uiy friends asked me was. How longI had been in the pit?

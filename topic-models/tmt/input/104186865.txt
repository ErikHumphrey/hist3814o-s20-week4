ali babaon,The Forty Thieves,DESTROYED BYMorgiana, a Female Slave.A TALE;{Fron the Arabian Nights' Entertainments.]SOLD WHOLESALE BY j; FRASER & C»..PRINTERS, STIRLING.• *\A L I BABA.TN a town of Persia there lived two brothers,the sons of a poor manj the one was namedCassim, and the other Ali Baba.Cassim, the elder, married a wife with a con¬siderable fortune, and lived at his ease in ahandsome house with plenty of servants; butthe wife of Ali Baba was as poor as himself;they dwelt in a mean cottage in the suburbs ofthe city, and maintained his family by cuttingwood in a forest nigh Bagdad, the city in whichhe resided.One day he went to the forest, as usual, withhis son, and having laden his son’s asses, anddespatched him to the city, was preparing toload his own with the wood he had cut, whenhe heard the sound of a horn, and, immediatelyafter, the neighing of horses. Upon lookingmore attentively he-discovered a troop of horse¬men, galloping towards the place where 'hestood.4.ALI BABA.He had often heard of robbers who infestedthat forest, and, in a great confusion, hastilyclimbed up a large thick tree, which stood atthe foot o| if rock, and hid himself among thebranches.w*> The horsemen soon galloped up to the rock,where they all dismounted.Ali Baba counted forty of them, and he 'could not doubt but they were thieves, by theirill-looking coutenances.Each took a loaded portmanteau from hishorse, and he who seemed to be their captain,turning to the rock, said, Open Sesame, andimmediately a door opened in the rock, and allthe robbers passed in, when the door shut ofitself.In a short time the door opened again, andthe robbers came out, followed by their cap¬tain; who said, Shut Sesame.The door instantly closed; and the troop,mounting their horses, were presently out ofsight.AH Baba remained in the tree a long time,and seeing that the robbers did not return, heventured down; and approaching close to therock, said, Open Sesame.Immediately the door flew open and Ali Ba¬ba beheld a spacious cavern, very light, and fil¬led with ali sorts of provisions, merchandise,tich stuffs and heaps of gold and silver coin,which these robbers had taken from merchantsand travellers.Ali Baba then went in search of his asses.ALI EABA.5and having brought them to the rock, took asmany bags of gold coin as they could carry,and put them on their backs; covering themwith some loose faggots of wood; and after¬wards (not forgetting to say Shut Sesame,) hedrove the asses back to the city; and hav¬ing unloaded them in the stable belongingto his cottage, carried the bags into the houseand spread the gold coin upon the floor beforehis wife.His wife delighted with possessing so muchmoney, wanted to count it; but finding itwonld take up too much time, she was re¬solved to measure it; and running to the houseof Ali Baba’s brother, she entreated them tolend her a small measure.Cassim’s wife was very proud and envious:‘ I wonder,’ she said to herself, ‘ what sort ofgrain such poor people can have to measure;but I am determined I will find out what theyare doing.’So before she gave the measure she artfullyrubbed the bottom with some suet.Away ran Ali Baba’s wife, measured her mo¬ney, and having helped her husband to biuy itin the yard, she carried back the measure toher brother in-law’s house, without perceivingthat a piece of gold was left sticking t® the bot¬tom of it.‘ Fine doings, indeed!’ cried Cassim’s wifeto her husband, after examining the meaeu.e,‘ y^ur brother there, who pretends to be soIjALI BABA.poor is richer than you are, for he does notcount his money, but measures it.’Cassim hearing these words, and seeing apiece of gold, grew as envious as his wife, andhastening to his brother threatened to informthe Cadi of his wealth, if he did not confess tohim how he came by it.Ali Baba without hesitation told him thehistory of the robbers, and the secret of thecave, and offered him half his treasure:, butthe envious Cassim disdained the offer, deter¬mined to have fifty times more than that out ofthe robbers’ cave.Accordingly, he rose early the next morn¬ing, and set out with ten mules loaded withgreat chests.He found the rock easily enough by Ali Ba-Baba’s description, and, having said, open Sesa¬me, he gained admission into the cave, wherehe found more treasure than he even had ex¬pected from his brother’s account of it.He immediately began to gather bags of goldand pieces of rich brocade, piling them closeto the door; but when he had got together asr M.'h, even more than his ten mules couldp:: ibly carry, and wanted to get out to loadtfjvrtt, the thoughts of his wonderful riches hadmane him entirely forget the word which caus¬ed me door to open.l:i vain he tried Vame, Fame, Fame, Vetame,and a thousand others; the door remained asimmoveable as the rock itself, notwithstana’ingAL1 CA'fii.7Cassim kicked and screamed, till he was i^adyto drop with fatigue and vexation.Presently he heard the sound of horses’ feet,which he rightly concluded to be the robbers,and he trembled lest he should fall a victim tohis thirst of riches.He resolved however to make one effort toescape: and when he heard Sesame pronouncedand saw the door open, he sprang out; but wasinstantly put to death by the swords of the rob¬bers.The thieves now held a council, but not oneof them could possibly guess by what mean$Cassim had got into the cave.They saw the heaps of treasure he had piledready to take away, Vat they did not miss whatAli Baba had secured before.At length they agreed to cut Cassim’s bodyinto four quarters and hang the pieces withinthie cave, that it might terrify any one from fur¬ther attempts; and also determined not to re¬turn themselves -for fear of being watched anddiscovered.When Cassim’s wife saw night come on, andher husband not returned, she became greatlyterrified.She watched at her window till day-break,and then went to tell Ali Baba of her fears.Cassim had not informed him of his designof going to the cave, but Ali Baba, now hearingof his journey thither, did not wait to be desir¬ed to go in search of him.S iLT BABA., . ,fie djove his asses to the forest with&ut •delay.He was alarmed to see blood near the rock)and on entering the cave he found the body ofhis Unfortunate brother cut to pieces, and hungup within the door. It was too late now to savehim; but he took down the quarters and putthem upon one of his asses, covering them withfaggots of wood; and weeping for the Qiiserableend of his brother, he regained the city.The door of his brother’s house was open¬ed by Morgiana, an intelligent faithful femaleslave, who AH Baba knew was worthy to betrusted with the secret.He therefore delivered the body to Morgiana,and went himself to impart the sad tidings tothe widow of Cassim.The poor woman was deeply afflicted, andreproached herself with her foolish envy andcuriosity, as being the cause of her husband’sdeath; but AH Baba having convinced her ofthe necessity of being very discreet, she check¬ed her lamentations and resolved to leave ev¬ery thing to the good management of Mor¬giana.Morgiana having washed the body, hastenedto an apothecary’s and asked for some particu¬lar medicine; saying it was for her master Cas¬sim, who was dangerously ill.She took care to spread the report of Cassim’sillness through the neighbourhood; and as theysaw AH Baba and his wife going daily to thehouse of their brother in great affliction, theyALT BABA. 9wore not surprised to hear shortly after that.Cassim had died of his disorder.The next difficulty was to bury him withoutdiscovery; but Morgiana was ready to contrivea plan for that also.She put on her veil, and went to a distant'part of the city very early in the morning,where she found a poor cobler just opening hinstall.She put a piece of gold in his hand; andtold him he should have another, if he wouldsuffer himself to be blindfolded, and go withher, carrying his tools with him.Mustapha the cobler hesitated at first; butthe gold tempted him and he consented.Morgiana then carefully covered his eyes, sothat he could not see a step of the way, and ledhim to Cassim’s house; and taking him to theroom where the body was lying, removed thebandage from his eyes, and bade him sew themangled limbs together. /•Mustapha obeyed her order; and having re¬ceived two pieces of gold, was led blindfold thesame way back to his own stall.Morgiana then covering, the body with awinding sheet, sent for the undertaker to makepreparations for the funeral; and Cassim wasburied with all due solemnity on that very sameday.Ali Baba now removed his few goods and allhis gold coin that he had brought from the ca¬vern, to the house of his deceased brother, of.wffiich he took possession; and Cassim’s widow10ALI BABA.received every kind attention both from Ali Ba¬ba and his wife.After an interval of some months, the troopof robbers again visited their retreat in the fo¬rest, and were astonished to find the body re¬moved from the cave, and every thing else re¬maining in its usual order.« We are discovered,’ said the Captain, ‘ andshall certainly be undone, if we do not adoptspeedy measures to prevent our ruin. Whichof you, my brave comrades will undertake todiscover the villain who is in possession of oursecret ?’One of the boldest of the troop advanced^and offered himself. He was accepted on thefollowing condition:—that if he succeeded inhis enterprise, he was to be made second incommand of the troop; but that if he broughtfalse intelligence, he was immediately to be putto death.The bold robber readily agreed to the condi¬tions, and disguising himself proceeded to thecity.He arrived there about day-break, and foundthe cobler Mustapha in his stall, which was al¬ways open before any shop in the town.‘ Good morrow, friend,’ said the robber as hepassed the stall, ‘ you rise betimes: I should* think, old as you are, you could scarcely see< to work by this light.’‘ Indeed, Sir,’ replied the cobler, ‘ old as I4 am, I do not want for good eye-sight; as youAL1 BABA.II‘ must needs believe, when I tell you I sewed a‘ dead body together the other day, where I had‘ not so good light as I have now.’‘ A dead body!’ exclaimed the robber, ‘you‘ mean, I suppose, that you sewed up the wind-‘ ing sheet for a dead body.’*1 mean no, such thing,’ replied Mustapha,‘ I te * you I sewed the four quarters of a mai*‘ together.’This was enough to convince the robber hehad luckily met with the very man whocould give him the information he was in searchof.However he did not wish to appear eager tolearn the particulars, lest he should alarm theold cobler.He therefore began to laugh: ‘ Ha! ha! ha!said he, ‘ I find, good Mr Cobler, that you per¬ceive I am a stranger here, and you wish tomake me believe that the people of your city doimpossible things.’‘ I tell you,* said Mustapha, in a deep and an¬gry tone, ‘ I sewed a dead body together withmy own hands.’‘ Then I suppose you can tell me alsowhere you performed this wonderful busi¬ness r’Upon this, Mustapha related every par¬ticular of his being led blindfold to* the house,&c.‘ Well, my friend,’ said the robber, ‘ tis a finestory I confess, but not very easy to believe12ALI BABA.ho’.vever, if you will convince me by shewingme the house you talk of, I will give you fourpieces of gold to make amends for my unbe¬lief/f I think,’ said the cobier after considering awhile, ‘ that if you were to biinciiohi me, ishould remember every turning we made; butWith my eyes open I am sure I should neverfind it/Accordingly the robber covered Mustapha’seyes with his handkerchief, who led him thro’most' of the principal streets, and stopping byCassini’s door, said, ‘ Here it is, I went no fur¬ther than this bouse.’The robber immediately marked the doorwith a piece of chalk; and giving Mustaphahis four pieces of gold, dismissed him.Shortly after the thief Mustapha hadrjuitted the door, Morgisma coming home frommarket, perceived the little i^iark of white chalkon the door; and 'suspecting something waswrong, directly marked four doors on one sideand five on the other of her master’s in exact¬ly the same manner, without saying a wordto any one.* The robber meantime rejoined his troop, andboasted greatly of his success.His captain and comrades praised his dili¬gence; and being well armed, they proceededto town in different disguises, and in separateparties of three or four together.It was agreed among them, that they wereto meet in the market-place at the dusk of e-AM BABA.ISveiling-, and that the captain, and the robberwho had discovered the house, were to go therefirst, to find out to v/hom it belonged.Accordingly being arrived in the street, andhaving a lantern with them, they began to ex¬amine the doors, and found; to their confusionand astonishment, that ten doors were markedexactly alike.The robber who was the captain’s guide•ould not say a word in explanation of this mys¬tery; and when the disappointed troop gotback to the forest his enraged companions or¬dered him to be put to death.Another now offered himself upon the sameconditions as the former; and having bribedMustapha, and discovered the house, he madea mark with dark red chalk upon the door, ina part that was not in tjie least conspicuous;and carefully examined the surrounding doors,to be certain that no such mark was upon any¬one of them.But nothing could escape the prying eyes ofMorgiana; scarcely had the robber departed,when she discovered the red mark; and gettingsome red chalk, she marked seven doors oneach side, precisely in the same place and in thesame manner.The robber, valuing himself highly upon theprecautions he had taken, triumphantly con¬ducted his captain to the spot; but great indeedwas his confusion and dismay, when he foundit impossible to say which among fifteen housesmarked alike, was the right one,.-14-AU BABA.The captain, furious with his disappoint¬ment, returned again with the troop to the fe-restj and condemned the second robber also todeath.The captain having thus lost two of histroop judged that their hands were more activethan their heads in such services, and he re¬solved to employ no other of them, but gohimself on the business.Accordingly, he repaired to the city, andaddressed himself to the cobler Mustapha, whofor six pieces of gold readily performed thesame services for him he had done for the twoother strangers. The captain, much wiserthan his men, did not amuse himself with sett¬ing a mark upon the.door, but attentively con¬sidered the house, considered the number ofwindows that were in it, and passed by it veryoften, to be certain that he should know itagain.He then returned to the forest, and orderedhis troop to go into the town and purchasenineteen mules and thirty-eight large jars, onefull of oil, and the rest empty.In two or three days jars were bought, andall things in readiness. The captain put a maninto each jar, properly armed, and rubbed oilon the outside of each, the covers having holesbored in them for the men to breathe through.With these he loaded his mules, and, in thehabit of an oil-merchant, entered the city inthe dusk of the evening.He proceeded to the street where Ali BabaALI BABA. 15dwelt, and found him sitting in the porch ofhis house.‘ Sir,’ said he to Ali Baba, I have broughtthis oil a great way to sell, and am too latefor this day’s market.‘ As I am quite a strauger in this town, willyou do me the favour to let me put my mulesinto your court-ypri, and direct me where Imay lodge to-night?’Ali Baba, who was a good-natured man, wel¬comed the pretended oil-merchant very kindly,and offered him a bed in his own house: andhaving ordered the mules to be unloaded inthe yard, and properly fed he invited his guestin to supper.The captain haying seen the jars properlyplaced in the yard?*followed Ali Baba into thehouse, and, after supper, was shewn the cham¬ber where he was to sleep.It happened that Morgiana was obliged tosit up later that night than usual to get readyher master’s bathing linen for the followingmorning, and while she was busy about thefire, her lamp went out, and there was nomore oil in the house.After considering how she could obtain alight, she recollected the thirty-eight oil jarsin the yard, and determined to take a little oilout of one of them for her lamp.She took her oil vessel in her hand, and ap¬proaching the first jar, the robber vdthin said‘ Is it time, captain?’Any other slave, perhaps, on heating many16ALT BABA,men in oil jars, would have screamed out; but-the prudent Morgiana instantly recollected her¬self, and replied softly, ‘ No not yet; he stilltill I call you.’She passed on to every jar repeating the samequestion, and receiving the same answer, tillshe came to the last, which was really filledWith oil.Morgiana was now convinced that this wasa plot of the robbers to murder her master AliBaba; so she ran back to the kitchen, andbrought out a large kettle which she had filledwith oil, and set it on a great wood fire; and assoon as it boiled, she went and-, poured into thejars sufficient of the boilingwithin them.Having done this shand her lamp, and crept softly to her cham¬ber.The captain of the robbers, bearing everything quiet in the house, and perceiving nolight any where, a-rose and went down into theyard to assemble his men.Coming to the first jar, he felt the streamof the boiled oil; he ran hastily to the rest,and found every one of his troop put todeath in the same jnanner.Full of rage and despair at having failedin his design, he forced the lock of a doorthat led to the garden, and made his escapeover the walls.On the following morning, I-Torgiana re¬lated to her master, Ali Baba, his wonderful' o^o kill every mani^rpnt out her fireALI BABA. 17deliverance from the pretended oil-merchantand his gang of robbers.Ali Baba at first could scarcely credit hertale; but when he saw the robbers dead inthe jars, he could not sufficiently praise hercourage and sagacity; and without letting anyone else into the secret, he and Morgiana,the next night, buried the thirty-seven thievesin a deep trench at the bottom of the garden.The jars and the mules, as he had no use forthem, were sent from time to different marketsand sold.While Ali Baba took these measures to-pre¬vent his and Cassim’s adventures in the forestfrom being known: the captain returned to hiscave, and for awhile abandoned himself to griefand despair.At length, however, he determined to adopta new scheme for the t.estruction of AH Baba.He removed by degrees all the valuable mer¬chandize from the cave to the city, ind took ashop exactly opposite to Ali Baba’s house.He furnished the shop with every thing thatwas rare and costly, and went by the name ofthe merchant Cogia Hassan.Many persons made acquaintance with thestranger; and among others, Ali Baba’s sonwent every day to his shop.The pretended Cogia Hassan soon appearedto be very fond of Ali Baba’s son, offered himmany presents, and often detained him to din¬ner, on which occasions he treated him in thehandsomest manner.ISALI BABA.AH Baba’s son thought it necessary to makesome return to these civilities, and pressed hisfather to invite Cogia Hassan to supper.Ali Baba made no objection, and the invita¬tion was accordingly given.The artful Cogia Hassan would not too has¬tily accept this invitation, but pretended he wasnot fond of going into company, and that hehad business which demanded his presence athome. These excuses only made Ali Baba’sson the more eager to take him to his father’shouse, and, after repeated solicitations, themerchant consented to sup at Ali Baba’s housethe next evening.A very splendid and delicious supper wasprovided, which Morgiana cooked in the bestmanner, and, as was her usual custom, shecarried in the first dish herself. Having sur¬veyed Cogia Hassan attentively, she perceivedthat he was the pretended oil-merchant.The prudent Morgiana did not say a wordto any one of this discovery, but sent the otherslaves into the kitchen, and waited at table her¬self. While Cogia Hassan was drinking, sheperceived he had a dagger beneath his cloak.Supper being ended, and the desert andwine on the table, Morgiana went away anddressed herself in the habit of a dancing-girl.She next called Abdalla, a fellow-slave, toplay on his tabor while she danced.When she appeared at the parlour door,her master, who was very fond of seeing her19ALI BAljA.ilance, ordered her to come in to entertain hisguest with some of her best dancing.Cogia Hassan was not very well pleased withthis entertainment, yet was compelled, for fearof discovering himself, to seem pleased withthe dancing, while, in fact, he wished Morgi-ana out of the apartment, alarmed lest heshould lose the present opportunity of mur¬dering AH Baba and his son.Morgiana continued dancing with the out¬most grace and agility. Then, drawing apoinard from her girdle, she performed manyastonishing feats with it:—sometimes present¬ing the point to one, and sometimes to ano¬ther, and, to the astonishment of all, seemedto plunge it into her own bosom.Suddenly she paused, and, holding the poi¬nard in the right hand, presented her left toher master, begging a little money. Ali Ba¬ba and his son, astonished at the request, pre¬sented her with a small piece of money.She then turned to the pretended Cogia Has¬san, and while he was putting his hand into hispurse, she plunged the poinard into his heart.‘ Wretch!’ exclaimed Ali Baba, starting fromhis seat, ‘ thou hast ruined me and my family.’‘ No, Sir,’ replied Morgiana, ‘ 1 have pre¬served and not ruined you and your son. Lookwell at this traitor, and you will find him tobe the pretended oil-merchant who came oncebefore to rob and murder you.’Morgiana having pulled off the turban andthe cloak which the false Cogia Hassan wore,20AH BABA.shewed that he was not only the pretended oil-»merchant, but the captain of the fo ty robberswho had slain his brother Cassim, nor couldhe doubt that his perfidious aim had been todestroy Ivm, and probably his son with theconcealed dagger.All Baba, who felt the new obligation heowed to Morgiana for thus saving his life a se¬cond time, embraced her, and said, ‘ My dearMorgiana, I give you your liberty; but mygratitude must not stop there, I will also mar¬ry you to my son, who can esteem and admireyou no less than does his father.’Then turning to his son, he added, ‘ You,my son, will not refuse the wife I offer; for,in marrying Morgiana, you take to wife thepreserver.and benefactor of yourself and yourfamily.’The son, far from shewing any dislike, rea¬dily and joyfully accepted his proposed bride,having long entertained an affection for thegood slave Morgiana.Having rejoiced in their deliverance, theyburied the captain that night with great priva¬cy in the fcrench along with his troop of rob¬bers; and a few days afterwards Ali Baba ce¬lebrated the marriage of his son a/id Morgianawith a sumptuous entertainment, and every onewho knew Morgiana said, site was worthy ofher good fortune, and highly commended hermaster’s generosity towards her.During a twelvemonth, Ali Baba forbore 3to go near the forest, but at length his curio-ALI BABA.21sify incited him then to mal^e another jour¬ney.When he came to the cave, he saw no foot¬steps either of men or horses; and havingpronounced open Sesame, went in, and judgedby the state of things deposited in the cavern,l that no one had been there since the pretendedCogia Hassan had removed the merchandise toi his shop in the city.Ali Baba took as much gold home with himas his horse would carry; and afterwards con-ducted his son to the cave, and taught him al-so the secret of opening it.This secret they handed down to their poste¬rity, who availed themselves of it, and usingtheir good fortune in beneficence to the poor,lived in honor and splendor, and fjUed withrenown some of the most eminent offices in theeity of Bagdad.22Turkish Impartiality.A Grocer of the city of Smyrna had a sonwho, with the help of the little learning thecountry could afford, rose to the post of Naib,or deputy to the Cady, or mayor of the city,and as such visited the markets, and inspectedthe weights and measures of all retail dealers.One day, while going his rounds, his fatherwas advised by the neighbours to remove hisweights, which they knew to be deficient. Theold cheat, depending on his relationship to theinspector, laughed at their advice, and, at hisshop door, calmly awaited his coming. TheNaib, however, was well assured of the dis¬honesty and'unfair dealing of his father, andresolved to detect his villany, and make an ex¬ample of him. Accordingly, he stopt at thedoor, and coolly said to him, ‘ Good man,fetch out your weights, that we may examinethem.’ Instead of obeying, the grocer was de¬sirous to put it off with a laugh, but was soonconvinced his son was serious, by hearing himorder the officers to search his shop, and see¬ing them produce the instruments of hisfraud, which, after an impartial examination,were openly condemned and broken to pieces.His shame and confusion, ho •ever, he hoped,would plead with a son to excuse him all fur¬ther punishment of his crime; the Naib, how¬ever, sentenced him to a fine of fifty piastres,23and to receive a bastinado of as many blowson the soles of his feet. All this was execut¬ed upon the spot; after which, the Naib, leap¬ing from his horse, threw h'mseJf at his feet,and watering them with his tears, addressedhim thus:—‘ Father, I have discharged my du¬ty to my God, my sovereign, my country, andmy station; permit me now, by my respect andsubmission, to acquit the debt 1 owe a parent.Justice is blind, it is the power of God onearth; it has no regard to father or son—God,and -our neighbour’s right, are above the ties ofnature. You had offended against the laws ofjustice, you deserved this punishment, youwould in the end have received it from someother. I am sorry it was your fate to receive itfrom me, my conscience would not suffer meto act otherwise—behave better for the future,and instead of blaming, pity my being reducedto so cruel a necessity.’ This done, he mount¬ed his horse again, and continued his journeyamid the acclamations and praises of the wholecity. Report of which being made to the Sub¬lime Porte, the Sultan advanced him to thepost of Cady; from which, by degrees, he eoscto the dignity of Mufti, who is the head ofboth religion and law among the Turks. Wereour dealers with false weights to be treated ac¬cording to the Turkish law, the poor mightnot be so much imposed on as they are at pre¬sent.24DISHONESTY PUNISHED.. An Usurer, having lost a hundred pounds ina bag, promised to give a reward of tenpounds to J:he person who should restore it. Aman having brought it to him, demanded thereward. The usurer, loath to give the rewardnow that he had got the bag, aliedged, after thebag was opened, that there were an hundredand ten pounds in it when he lost it. The us¬urer being called before the judge, unwarily ac¬knowledged that the seal was broke open in hispresence, and that there were no more at thattime but a hundred pounds in the bag. ‘ Yousayj’ says the judge, «that the bag you lost hada hundred and ten pounds in it.’ «Yes, mylord.’ ‘ Then,’ replied the judge, ‘ this cannotbe your bag, as it contained but a hundredpounds: therefore the plaintiff must keep it tillthe true owner appears; and you must look foryour bag. where you can find it.’FINIS.

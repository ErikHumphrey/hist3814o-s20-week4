O dool for the order,Sent our lads to the border !The English for anes, by guile got the day :The Flowers of the Forest,That ay shone the foremost,The prime of our lads lie cold in the clay.We’ll hear nae mair lilting.At our ewes milking :The women and bairns are dowie and wae,Sighing and moaning,On ilka green loaning,Since our bra’ Forresters are a wed away.I have seen the smilingOf fortune beguiling j.I have felt all her favours, and found her decaSweet are her blessing,And kind her caressing ;But now it is Hod, it is lied far away.I nave sopn the forest,Adouied the foremost,With Cowers of the fairest both pleasant and ga’Sae bonny was there blooming,Their scent the air perfuming,But now they are withered, and all gone awayI have seen the morning,With gold the lulls adorning,-7And loud tempest storming before the middle day;I’ve seen Tweed’s silver streams,Shining in the sunny beams,Grow drumly and dark as it rolled away.O fickle fortuue !Why thus cruel spoiling ?Why thus perplexing poor sons of a day?Thy frowns cannot fear me,Nor smiles cannot chear me,Since the Flowers of the Forest are a’ wed away.JOHNNY COPE.(COPE sent a letter frae Dumbar,Charlie meet me an’ ye dare,.And I’ll learn you the art of war,If you’ll meet wi’ me in the morning.Hey Johnny Cope are ye waking yet,Or are your drums a-beating yet,If ye were waking I would wait,To gang to the coals i’ the morning:* When Charlie look’d the letter upon,He drew his sword the scabbard from,Come follow me my merry merry men,Ah’ we’ll meet Johnny Cope i’ the morning,Hey Johnny Cope, &c.Now Johnny be as good as your word.Come let us try both fire and sword,8*And dinna rin awa like a frighted bird,That’s chac’d frae its nest i’ the morning.Hey Johnny Cope, Sec.When Johnny Cope he heard of this,He thought it wadna be amissTo ha’e a horse in readinessTo flee awa i’ the morning.Hey Johnny Cope, &c.Fy now Johnny get up an’ rin,The Highland bag-pipes make a diu,lt’s\>est to sleep in a hale skin,For 'twill be a bluidie morning.Hey Johnny Cope, &c.When Johnny Cope to Dunbar came,They spear’d at Jiim whare’s a’ you men fThe never a bit do I ken,For I left them a’ i’ the morning.Hey Johnny Cope, &c.Now, Johnny, troth ye was nae blate,To come wi’ the news o’ your ain defeat.And leave your ain men in sic a strait,So early i’ the morning.Hey Johnny Cope, &c.Alas ! tjuoth Johnny, I get a fleg,W i’ their claymores and ph'.labegs,If 1 face them again I’ll break my legs ;So I wish you a good morning.Hey Johnny Cope, See.FINIS.

Having so done, place your bush in somequickset or dead hedge near unto towns ends, backyards, old houses, or the like: for these are the resortof small birds in the spring time; in the summer andharvest in groves, bushes, or white thorn trees, quicksethedges near corn fields, fruit trees, flax, and hemp lands ;and in the winter about houses, hovels, barns, stacks,or other places where stand ricks of corn, or scatteredchaff, &c.As near as you can to any of these haunts, plant yourlime bush, and plant yourself also at a convenient dis¬tance undiscovered, imitating with your mouth severalnotes of birds, which you must learn by frequent prac¬tice, walking the fields for that purpose very often, observing the variety of several birds sounds, especially jsuch as they call one another by.Some have been so expert herein, that they could :imitate the notes of twenty several sorts of birds at least,by which they have caught ten birds to another’s onethat was ignorant therein.If you cannot attain it by your industry, you must ||buy then a bird call, of which there are several sorts, 1and easy to be framed ; some of wood, some of horn,; some of cane, and the like.Having learnt first how to use this call, you shall1 sit and call the birds unto you, and as any of them lighton your bush, step not out unto them till you see themsufficiently entangle; neither is it requisite to run forevery single bird, but let them alone till more come, forthe tiuttering is as good as a stale to entice them more.You may take these small birds only with lime twigswithout the bush.Some boys have taken two or three hundred smalltwigs about the bigness of rushes, and about three incheslong, and have gone with them into a field where therewere hemp cocks ; upon the tops of half a score lyingall round together, they have stuck their twigs, andthen have gone and beat that field or the next to it,where they saw any birds, and commonly m such fieldsthere are infinite numbers of linnets and green birds,which are great lovers of hemp seed.And they flying in such vast flocks, they havecaught at one fall for them upon the cocks eight dozenat a time.But to return, there is a pretty way of taking birdswith lime-twigs, by placing them near a stale or twomade of living bats, placing them aloft that they may bevisible to the birds thereabouts', who will no sooner be. perceived, but every bird will come and gaze, wonderingat the strangeness of the sight, and having no otherconvenient lighting place, but where the lime twigs areyou may take what number you list of them. But theowl is a far better stale than the bat, being bigger andmore easily to be perceived, besides he is never seenabroad but he is followed and persecuted by all the birdsthat are near.If you have not a living bat or owl, their skins willserve as well, stuffed, and will last you twenty years ;there are some who have used an owl cut in wood, andnaturally painted, with wonderful success.SKLUKT TO HI.VOKH P1GKO.SS THOM QUITTING A PIGEONHOt’SU.lake the head ami feet of a gelt goat, and boil themtogether till the Hcsh separates from the bone ; take thisflesh and boil it again in the same liquor, till the wholeis consumed; bruise into this decoction, which is verythick, some potters earth, out of which you are to takeall the stoilesj vetch, dung, hemp, food, and corn; thewhole must lie kneaded together, and reduced to a pasteor dough, which form into small loaves about the thick¬ness of two fists, and dry them in the sun or oven, andtake care it do not burn ; when they are baked, laythem in several parts of the pigeon-house, and as soonas they are set there the pigeons will amuse them¬selves with pecking them, and finding some taste there¬in, which pleases them, they will keep so close to it,that they will not afterwards leave it but with re¬gret.

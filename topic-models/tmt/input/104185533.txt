th ir gros tdings with sorrow and woe,** JJt5Tet seem’d that night as his anger had been gone.Lest that young Grigor the place should abscond.But he sent a messenger into Inverness,Which brought out a party young Grigor to press,And for to make ready, no time gave we hear,He ask’d bat one favour, a word of his dear.When being deny’d, the old man with a frown,Said, Soldiers can have sweethearts in every town:At this the young Lady cry’d bitterly,May the heavens requite you for your cruelty.Young Grigor took courage and marched away.When the captain viewed him, this to him did say,For the Lady that lov’d you, Sir, I piety her case.Who’s lost such a beauty and sweet blooming face.His lady cry’d ont, What a wretch can he be.Caus’d press this young man for no injury!His long yeliow hair to his haunches hang’d down,Over his broad shoulders from ear to ear round.Now Grigor, considering his pitiful case.Received the bounty, and swore to the peace.His Captain unto him a furlong he gave,To see his dear Katty once more he did crave.Two lines then he sent her by a solid hand,That he under the oak at midnight would stand.For to wait upon her, and hear her complaint,And there for to meet him she was well content.Her vows she renewed, with tears not a few.And a gold-ring on’s finger as a token she threw,Which was not to move come death or cemc life,Till that happy moment he made her hi* wife.6.She fain would go with him, but he answered no.For your parents will follow, and cause us morewo;My Maker be witness, and this green Oak, said he,That I ne’er shall enjoy a woman but thee.A.nd here where he left her a-weeping full sore,Poor creature, she never got sight of him more.For in short time thereafter he went to sea.And left the sight of Britain with the tear in hiseye.And went to America, their orders being so,There prov’d a gallant soldier,and valour did show,That for his behaviour they ne’er could him blame.From a corporal, at last to a serjeant he came.PART HI.BEing near Fort Niagara, in the year fifty-nine,On the 30th of July, as he always did incline,To frequent the green-wood at some distant place.To breath out his sorrows his mind to solace.Among the savage Indians, alas! here he fell*.But how he was murdered we cannot well Sell,For on the next morning they found him theredead; .Two Indians lay by him wanting their head.Cut off with his broad sword as they understood.As there all around him was nothing but blood,Five wounds in his body, his hair scalpt away,His.clothes, sword, and pistol of all made a prey:And one of his fingers from his hand theyhad cut.On which the gold-ring from his love- he had got,7I In that very moment, though in Scotland, we hear,i A dreadful tpectre to his love did appear,As she was a-weeping under the green Oak,;! He quickly past by her and nora word spoke;Si Yet shaking the left hand, where the ring he didwear,' Which wanting a linger and blood dropping were.Whereat the young Lady was struck with amaze,. And rose to run after, and on him did gaze;.As she knewit was Grigor, but how in that place,It made her to wonder and dread the sad case.With terror and grief, home she did retire,iAnd spent the whole night in weeping and prayer.So early next morning she rose with ihe sun,jlWent back to the green Oakj to weep all alone.For always she esteem’d that place as we hear.As on it she got the last sight of her dear: ,As there she sat weeping and tearing, her hair,.Again the pale spectre to her did appear,And with a wild aspect it stat’d in her face,jlfheii said, O dear Katty, do not me embrace;7or I’m but a spirit, though shining in blood,dy body lies murdered in a foreign wood:There’s two wounds in my body and three iamy side,Vri:h hatchets and arrows that’s both deep andwide;iy scalp and fine hair for a premium is sold,net also my finger, with the ring of pure gold,/nidi you threw upon it as a mark of true love,ovt’t stronger than death, for it does remove,8For my earnest desire, it is for you my dear.And till you are with me I’ll still wander here.For this world’s but vanity, all’s but avain show,It’s nought to the pleasures where we are to go;She went to embrace him, being void of all fright^But he in a moment went out of her sight.Then home in great horror to her father didrun,Cry’d, Oh! ctuel father, now what have you done;Grigor! loved Grigori came to me in blood!And his body lies murder’d in an American wood.He shew’d me his wounds, and each bleedingsore,And therefore my pleasures on earth are no more,Her father look’d at her as one being amaz’d,Then said, my dear Katty, your brains they arecraz’d.But still she maintain’d it, and cry’d like a child;Ne’er was seen for to laugh, nor yet for to smile;Brought to her all doctors, whose skill was in vain,Who still gave opinion she was sound in the brain.Her body decay’d and her face wan and pale,She soar’d to her true love, beyond death’s darkvale:First her, then her mother in one night expir’d;J hope she enjoys the bliss she desir’d.Now the old father he cries, bereft ®f all joys,Tbo’ he has plenty of gold, no girls nor boys;Let all cruel parents to this take great heed,His pretty young daughter is now with the dead.FINIS.

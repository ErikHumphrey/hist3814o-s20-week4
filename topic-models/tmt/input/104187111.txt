A -rrrjn etMSIR JAMES THE ROSE.Of all the Scottish northern chiefsOf high and warlike name,The bravest was Sir James the Rose,A knight of meikle fame.His growth was like a youthful oak,That crowns the mountain’s brow:And waving o’er his shoulders broadHis locks of yellow flew.Wide were his fields, his herds were larAnd large his flocks of sheep,And numerous were his goatsUpon the mountain steep.The chieftain of the good clan Rose,A firm and warlike band,Five hundred warriors drew the swordBeneath his high command.In bloody fight thrice had he stood.Against the English keen,Ere two and twenty opening springsThe blooming youth had seen.The fair Matilda dear he lov’d,A maid of beauty rare;Even Margaret, on the Scottish throne,Was never half so fair.3Long had he woo’d, long she refused,With seeming scorn and pride;Vet oft her eyes confess’d the loveHer fearful words denied.At length she blessed his well tried love,Allow’d his tender claim ;She vow’d to him her tender heart.And own’d an equal flame.Her father, Buchan’s cruel lord,Their passion disapprov’d;He bade her wed Sir John the Graeme,And leave the youth she lov’d.One night they met as they were wont,Deep in a shady wood;Where on the bank, beside the burn,A blooming saugh tree stood.Conceal’d among the underwoodThe crafty Donald lay.The brother of Sir John the Graeme,To watch what they might say.When thus the maid began, My sireOur passion disapproves;He bids me wed Sir John the Graeme,So here must end our loves.My father’s will must be obey’d,Nought boots me to withstand ;Some fairer maid in beauty’s bloom,Shall bless thee with her hand.Soon wall Matilda be forgot.And from thy mind effac’d ;4But mav that happiness be thine,Which I can never taste! . /What do I hear? is this thy vow ?Sir James the Rose replied;And will Matilda wed the Greeme,Though sworn to be my bride ?His sword shall sooner pierce my heartThan ’reave me of thy charms ;And clasp’d her to his throbbing breastFast lock’d within his arms.1 spoke to try thy love, she said.I’ll ne’er yred ajan but thee;The grave shall be my bridal bed,If Graeme my husband be.Take then, dear youth, this faithful kiss,In witness of my troth ;And every plague become my lot,That day I break my oath.They parted thus—the sun was set—Up hasty Donald flies;And turn thee, turn thee, beardless yopth,He loud insulting cries.Soon turned about the fearless Chief,And soon his sword he drew ;For Donald’s blade before his breast.Had pierced his tartans through.This for my brother’s slighted love.His wrongs git on my arm—Three paces back the youth retir’d,And sav’d himself from liarm .5Returning swift, his sword he rear’dFierce Donald’s head aboveAnd through the brain, a»d crashing bone,The furious weapon throve.Life issued at the wound—he fellA lump of lifeless clay ;So fall my foes, quoth valiant Rose,And stately strode away. x..Through the green wood in haste he j}a£E:’dUnto Lord Buchan’s hall-—Beneath Matilda’s window stood.And thus on her did call,;Art thou asleep, Matilda dear,Awake, my love ! awake ;Behold thy lover waits, without,A long farewell to take.For I have slain fierce Donald Graeme,His blood is on my sword ;And far, far distant ore my men.Nor can defend their lord.To Skye I will direct my flight.Where my brave brothers bide ;And raise the mighty of the Isles,To combat on my side.O do not so, the maid replied.With me till morning stay ;For dark and dreary is the night.And dang’rous is the way.AH night I’ll watch yon in the paffy,My faithful page I'll send.6In haste to raise the brave clan Rose,Their master to defend.He laid him down beneath a bush,And wrapp’d him in his plaid—While trembling for her lover’s fate.At distance stood the maid.Swift ran the page o’er hill and dale,Till, in a lonely glen.He met the furious Sir John Gr<eme,With twenty of his men.Where goest thou, little page, he said,So late ? who did thee send ?—I go to raise the brave clan Rose,Their master to defend.For he has slain fierce Donald Grpeme,His blood is on his sword;And far, far distant are his men,Nor can assist their lord.And has he slain my brother dear.The furious chief replies;Dishonour blast my name but heBy me ere morning dies.Say, page, where is Sir James the Rose ?I will thee well reward—He sleeps into Lord Buchan’s park,Matilda is his guard.They spurred their steeds and fnrious flew,Like lightning o’er the lee ;They reach’d Lord Buchan’s lofty tow’rs,By dawning of the day.7.Matilda stood without the gate,Upon a rising ground—And watch’d each object in the dawn.All ear to every sound.Where sleeps the Rose ? began the Graeme,Or has the felon fled ?This hand shall lay the wrretch on earthBy whom my brother bled.And now the valiant knight awoke.The virgin shrieking heard;Straight up he rose and drew his sword/When the fierce band appeared.'Your sword last night my brother slew,His blood yet dims its shine;And e’er the sun shall gild the morn,Your blood shall reek on mine.*.. fYour words are brave the chief returned.But deeds approve the man ;Set by your men, and hand to hand,We’ll try what valour can.With dauntless step he forward strode,And dared him to the fight;The Graune gave back : he feared his arm,For well he knew his might.Four of his men, the bravest four,Sunk down beneath his sword ;But still he scorned the poor revenge,And sought their haughty lord.Behind him basely came the Graeme,And pierced him in the side •isOut spouting came the purple stream,And all his tartans dved.■ . nBut yet his hand dropped not the sword,Nor sunk he to the ground-—Till through his enemy’s heart the steelHad forced a mortal wound.Gr»me, like a tree by wind o’erthrowu.Fell breathless on the clay !And down beside him sank the Rose,And faint and dying lay.Matilda saw and fast she ran—0 spaae his life, she cried—Lord Buchan’s daughter hegs his life,Let her not be denied.Her well-known voice the hero heardtHe rais’d his death-clos’d eyes;He fix’d them on the weeping maid,And weakly thus replies .-In vain Matilda begs a life,By death’s arrest denied;My race is run—adieu my love,Then closed his eyes and died.The sword yet warm from his left side.With frantic hand she drew;I come, Sir James the Rose, she cried,1 come to follow you." ' ;The hilt she lean'd against the ground,And bar’d her snowy breast;Then fell upon her lover’s face,And sunk to endless rest.

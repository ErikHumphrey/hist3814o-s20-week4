My lovely Poll,’ Tom faintly cries,‘ Thy poignant grief dispel;5Wipe pff those tears which dim thire eyesThen sigh'd and bade farewell:Hut, ah ! e’er long poor Tom had leftHU Poll and native shore,When by a shot of life bereft,He fell, to rise no more.The fatal news, Tom’s death to tell,Resounded from afar;And told how brave in battle fellThis gallant British tar.P*or Polly now, with piteous sighs,Tom’s dismal end relate ;Aud to some desert spot she flies,To mourn his hapless fate.usodlt -ilo^a siorlt Wtidt bm; etsierl deM... ■„ •, lk fo... fr.There’s nae Luck about the House.Aud are ye sure the news are true.And are ye sure he’s w< II,Is this a time to ta’k of walk,Mak haste set by your wheel,Is this a time to ta’k of wark,Mak haste set by your wheel.Is this a time to ta’k of wal k,When Collin’s at the door ;Gie me my clock, Til to the quey,Aud see him come a-shore.Por there’s nac luck about the house,There’s nae luck at a’;6There'# little pleasure in the bouee,When our goodinan’s awa.jhil bw'l uioT fieoq y n,l io'o ! r!iR»e up, and make a clean fure-iide,Put on the muckle p)at,Gie little Kate her cotton gown,And Jock his Sunday’s coat,And make their shoon as black as slacs,Their hose as white as sna.t's a' to please our ain goedman,For he’s been hang awa.For there’s nue luck, &c.There is twa hens into the bauk,S’been fed fed this month and mair,Mak haste and thravv tlieir necks about.That Colin well may fare;And spread the tab'e neat and clean.Gar il^a tbjng look braw,It’s a’ for love of my goodman,For he’s been lang avi a.For there’s nae luck, Ac.io >1 fci of orrti'j a aidf tl9, Gie me down my big bonnet,My bishop’s sattin gown,For I maun tell tell the baillie’s wife,That Collin’s come to town ;My Sunday’s shoon they maun gae on,My hose o’ pearl blue,It’s a’ to please my ain goodman,For he’s bauh led and t rue.For there's nae l.uek, &c.7$&£ tine s Ins words, 8ttG smootii s his triosirhHis breath’s like caller air, P^’His very foot has music in’t,When he comes up the stair.And will 1 see his face again,And will I hear him speak ;I'm downright dizzy wi’ the thought,l» Until I’m like to greetFor there’s nae luck, Ac.Tbe cauld blasts of the winter wiad,ITiat thrilled thro’ my heart,They’re a’ blawn by, I hae him safe.Till death we’ll never part;But what puts parting in my head.It may be far awa,Hie present moment is our ain.The neist we never saw.For there’s nae luck, &c..1 ) id* ho sa aih h iSince Collin’s well, I’m well content,I ha’e na mair to ciave,Could I but live to mak him blest,I’m blest aboon the lave:And will I see bis face again,And will I hear him speak ;I’m downright dizzy wi’ the thought,la troth I’m like to greet.For there’s nae luck, Ac.8Come boat me o'er, come row me o'er,Come boat me o’er to Charlie;I’ll gi’e John Ross another bawbeeTo boat me o'er to Charlie.We’ll o’er the water, we’ll o’er the sea,V> e ll o’er the water to Charlie,Come weel, come woe, we’ll gather and go,And live or die wi’ Charlie.I io’e weel my Charlie’s name,Tho’ some there be abhor him ;Uut, O ! to see auld Nick gaun hameAnd Charlie’s faes before him !We‘U o’er &c,f swear and vow bv moon and *tnr«,And sun that shines so early,j-f I had twenty thousand lives.I’d die as oft for Charlie.We'll © er, &c.v - ,9'ffMO ot liani an ; '.taold mid ol -avU-i::*..! uluo )FINIS.fi^ i li' " 1 ilrW.nlgnofll oilt i« vsKib irigiinr4

fasten them witli one of you;garters to your left wrist on going to bed, and bind theother garter round your head ; then say,St. Peter take it not amiss,To try your favour I’ve done this;You are the ruler of the keys.Favour me then, if you pleaseLet me then your influence prove,And see my dear and wedded love.This must be done on the Eve of St. Peter’s, and is a«old charm used by the maidens of Rome in aucicntimes, who put great faith in it.A CURIOUS SPELL.If a maid wishes to see her lover, let her take tkfollowing method.

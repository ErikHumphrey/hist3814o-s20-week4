He that minds his book shallhave praise, but he that will notlearn must feel the rod. The wisechild will think of his book and shallnot be beat; the fool will mind playand must be whipt.When you rise out of your bedin the morn, first pray to God, tobless and keep you this day, and allthe days of your life, from all things19that may hurt you. Give him thanksfor his great love to you ; for yourhealth, rest, and strength; for hiscare of you, and all that lie givesyou. Let your first thoughts be ofhim—to him lift up your heart.Next wash your hands and faceclean ; comb your hair; and thengo to school. Walk in peace to andfrom school; let not your voice beheard in the street, nor give causeto those who see you, to say you arerude. Pull off' your hat, or make abow to those you meet, and know bythe way all your friends.When you are come to school,first bow to him who is to teach youwhat you are to learn. Then sitdown in your place, but make nonoise all the time you are there.—What you are to learn, do to thebest of your skill; for that will beyour own when you are gone fromschool.God made the world •, by thegoword of the Lord the earth, the seasand alj things were made. He form¬ed the light, he gave the sun fear alight by day, and the moon and starsfor a light by night. He formed thehills, the fowls of the air, the plantsqf the field, and the herbs for the useof man : He said let them be and itwas SO- Q Lord how great are thyworks!The Lord he is God; it is hethat hath made us, and not we ourjselves. He hath formed us, that weshould show forth his praise. Whythen hath the. fool said in his heart,there is no God ? Shall the worksay of him that made it, he made itnot? Ye fools, when vvill yq bewise ?Bring the poor that are cast outto thy house. Hide not thy selffrom thine own flesh. Charge themthat are rich in this world, that theyhe rich in good works. -Give almsof such things as you have. Thoushaft not glean thy field : thou shaltleave to the poor. Take heed thatyou dd not your almS to be Seen ofmen : but when thou dost alms, letnot thy left hand kno\^ what thyright hand doth.Walk not thou in the way of illmen ; keep thy feet from their path :pass not by it turn from it; £o riotnear it; least thou learn their waysand1 get a snare to thy soak Cottieout front them saith the Lord ; takeheed to thyself, that thou be riotsnared by them. Love not themthat hate the Lord ; with such a onedo not eat.God is a true God, most wise,just, and good. There is but oneGod, and I ought to fear hirh, andin all my ways to trust in him, andplease him. He is good to all.By the word of God were allthings made, and in hirir I live andmove.I should be lost if I bad not Orifc22to save me, and he that saves me isChrist the Lord.He took on him the form of man,and did live a good life ; he didpreach good words and works to us,of God and the next world.He wrought strange things; hemade the sick well, and the lame hemade to walk.He did die for the whole worldthe sad death of the cross, for oursins, to make God a friend to us.He rose from the dead on the thirdday, and did go up to bliss ; wherehe is ]iow at the right hand of God,where he still lives and will be ourfriend.And he will come from thence atthe last day to judge the world.W e must love God with all ourhearts, and do as we would be doneby.I must not take the name of Godin vain, but must love him and fearhim. ' ' - ' i. •23; I must hear and read God’s wordwith great joy, and must give thanksto him for all the good he hath doneto me, and to all.I must keep the Lord’s day well,and not speak my own words, nordo my own works on that day.I must seek the love of God, andpray to him for grace, and givethanks to him for all he has done tous.We must pray in the name ofChrist for grace, to help in the timeof need.I must own my own sins, andgive God praise, for he has beengood to me.I must take care, day by day, thatmy heart be not prone to pride, andtake care of a rash wish.I must set a watch on my mouth,and take care of my words. I mustnot tell a lie, nor mock at any one,nor call any foul names, nor speakill words.24I must give all men their dues;I must be just in all my ways; Imust love my friends, and speak wellof all men.I eah not da it in mine Ownstrength, but in the strength of thegrace of Christ, which I must ask ofGod for his sake.i .... . ..... . + . a , , .■One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.I.

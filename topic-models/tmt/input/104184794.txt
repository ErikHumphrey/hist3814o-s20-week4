It had within the walls one hun-red and fifty thousand inhabitants, besidesn omen and children.t ! The trenches about it were sixty feet deep^11 out of the rock, and two hundred and fiftywoad. Not long after S’aishak king of Egyptok it, and became master of Solomon’s riches^i d of all king David’s spoil, which he had tak-I’i from many nations, 2 Kings xiv. it was againijindered, and part of the wall broken downi Joash king of Israel, in Amaziah’s reign,(Kings xvi. Not long after, Anaz the fifteenthng of Judah, impoverished the temple, to pre-it Tiglathpilnezer with the treasures thereof,i 1 Manasseh lost what remained.4And Nebuchadnezzar laid this glorious city,with the temple, palace, walls, and towers evenwith the ground, 2 Kings xix. After eighteenmonths’ siege, in the eleventh year of Nebu¬chadnezzar’s reign, the princes of Babylon sur¬prise^, and took this brave city ; presently afterNebuzar-adan, general of the Babylonian army,commanded by Nebuchadnezzar, spoiled th$temple, carrying away the vessels of gold andsilver, and the great laver given by king Solo¬mon, and burnt the temple the first day of thenext month, which was twenty-one days after thesurprisal, 470 years, six months and ten days af- ']ter the foundation ; 903 years, six months andten days after the departure of the people out |of Egypt; 1760 years, six months after theflood; 3516 years, six months and ten daysafter the creation. Thus, and then was the cityof Jerusalem taken, and for seventy years theJews remained in this captivity.It was built again by Nehemiuh, 2 Chron. i. ii.iii, iv. The temple and city were spoiled againby Burgoses, lieutenant to Artaxerxes, then byPtolmeus the first, then by Antiochus Epiphanesj,and again by Appoilonius’ deputy ; after whichit was taken by Pompey, ami robbed by Cras-Jsius in his Parthian expedition. 'Yet all thailosses the temple and city sustained, were re-jpaired by Herod the Great, who enlarged thecity, new-built) the temple,glorious; it waswalls, the thirdenlargedand left it botbflcompassed with!]wall had ninety!Iv.vers, the second wall had fourteen, and theId wall had sixty. Agrippa built a founh wail;n cubits high, but did not finish it, lest Clnudi-s Caesar should think that ho designed to rebel;et the Jews afterwards built it twenty cubits1 igh, and raised a battlement two cubits, and"inilt three towers thereon ; ail their towers wereli mit of white marble, each stone being twentyi ubits long, ten broad, and five thick, so curious-']ly joined, that they seemed but one stone, andhe compass of the city, from the north to theU’est, was forty-three furlongs.Jj Within the city was the king’s palace, surpass¬ing all in the world for largeness and workman-jihip, environed whh a wall, which was thirty;’ubits high, adorned with towel's, and beautifiedjlj.vitli houses to an hundred of the nobility; andI n every room were many vessels of gold andf silver, and porches adorned with curious pillars,and many pleasant walks, with all manner of(trees and fountains, which spouted out water,with cisterns and brazen statues, from whichwater ran continuallv.The temple was built upon a rocky mountain,and the place at the top, was not at first bigenough for the temple and court, the hill beingJvcry steep, but the people every day broughtjeartli thither, and they at last made it plain, and|lar-ge enough, with wonderful curiosity and la-jbonr, ifttlosed with three walls, which werer.many days labour, with the cost of all the holyItreasure offered to God from all parts; thefoundation of the temple was laid three hundredds-M trches were double, supporte d H&lif Lji?& twenty cubits liigb, all o;oj:»4 piece if JssArble j the tops of cedar so exactly wrought astonished beholders; the porches, thirty cubits broad, and the compass othe temple was six furlongs; the courts wercuriously paved and wrought with all sorts ostones, and the gates were covered with weight;plates of gold; only one v/ith Corinthian brass,which for beauty excelled the others, dazzlingthe eyes of the spectators.Then ‘.he Sanctum Sanctorum, or Holy of Ho¬lies, situated in the midst, had twelve stairsto go up to it, the fore part of it was an hundredcubits high, and as many broad, and backwardsit was forty cubits on ead) sfde. It bad, as itwere, two shoulders twenty cubits high, a ruttwenty-five wide, and had no doors, to shew tiintheaven was always open. AH the fore parts were!gilded within and covered wnli fine gold : the inner part was divided into two rooms, whereoilthe first only might be seen, which was in heighninety cubits, in length forty, and in breadthtwenty. Round about tho wall was a gohvine, whcreorf diung grapes in clusters, beingsix feet long; it had golden gates' fifty-five cu¬bits high, and sixteen broad, and curious hang¬ings of the same length, wrought with purplevelvet, scarlet, and silk. All the fahw was scexquisite and rich, that none could imagine anyworkmanship to be wanted, for it was nil cover¬ed with massy plates of gold, which nstbnishcithe bqhcfidcrs ; the top also was set with rods o«gold, sharp at the ends, lest birds should sit there¬on, and defile the holy place.Our Saviour was born in the year of theworld 'tOOt, and in the 43d year of AugustusCaesar ; many remarkable things were seen in theheavens, which caused the wise men to conclude,that some more than an ordinary person wouldappear upon the earth ; the learned thought itto he Augustus Caesar, who then reigned pros¬perously ; but others thought it to be he whom'the prophet Isaiah speaks of that should havethe government on his shoulders, even the Sa-.viour of the world, whom the Evangelists men¬tion, that the angels declared to the shepherds,'and the star directed the wise men of the east tofind out the place of his birth. So that,As the new earth with a new sun rvas blest,So heaven with a new glorious star was drest.At Christ’s birth, the temple at Home, dedicat¬ed to the god Pan, fell to the earth j and whenit vvas built, the Romans addressed the oracle of/.polio, to know how long it should endure;who answered,“ Till aVir<nh should brine: fortha son,” which they judged impossible, thereforethey believed that their temple should last eter-"aNy* ,The night that Christ was horn, there appear¬ed in Spain at midnight, a cloud with so greata light, that it seemed like mid-day.

Atthe clfth year of his age he disputed with thetlfx i: is, and at tliai time there appeared a ter-sibie comet, so that the light of the sun appa¬rently failed, the heavens seemed to burn, andfre beams fell from them. In the twenty se¬cond y ear of his age, several bloody comets wereFetn, and the river Tiber overflowed the city ofHome.T’t'RLius Lentulxus’ Epistle to Rome con¬cerning Christ.> - ,f‘There appeared in those days a man of greatvirtue ca'letl Jesus Christ, who is yet livingenrong us, and by the people is called a pro-pint ; but his own disciples call him the Sox ofGod. He raiseth the dead, cureth all mannerof diseases ; a man of stature, somewhat tall andcomely, with a reverend countenance, such asthe beholders may hot!) fear and love; Ins hairof the colour of a chcsnut full ripe, and plaindown almost to his cars, but from tiience down¬ward some-what curled, but more orient of co¬lours, waving about his shoulders ; in die midstof his head gocth a seam of hair, or parting,jibe that of the Nazarites : his forehead very9plain and smooth ; his face without spot orWinkle, beautified with a comely red j his nosqand mouth so formed, that nothing can be re¬prehended, his beard thick, in colour of thehair of his head ; his eyes grey, clear and quick,in reproving he is severe, in counselling, cour¬teous and fair spoken ; pleasant in speech, mix¬ed with gravity, it cannot be remembered thatany have seen him laugh, but many'have seenhim weep ; in proportion of body well shapedand straight, bis hands and arms very delectableto behold ; in speaking very temperate, modestand wise ; a man, for his singular beauty farexceeding the sons of men.”Within the thirty-third year of Christ’s life,he was crucified by the wicked hands of theJews, v/hich caused many miracles, attested bothby Heathens and Christians. At his deaththere was a mighty darkness in the day time,from six till cine, that is, from our twelve to ourthree in the afternoon, and yet no eclipse of thesun, it being full moon; so it was contrary tothe order of nature, but the power of God de¬prived the sun of his light.Dionysius the Areopagitc, being that day inAthens, and seeing the darkness, cried with aloud voice, “ hither the world is at an end, ofthe God of nature suffers.” Then the men ofAthens being astonished, built an altar to theUnknown God ; and afterwards St. Paul de¬clared to them, “ That Christ,” who suff-redthat day, “ was the Unknown God,” wherebyhe conveited many to the Christian faith.10It is likewise acknowledged by Plutarch,though a Heathen, that after the death of Christ,not only the oracles of Egypt ceased, but throughall the world, for which he can give no reason,being ignorant of Christianity; however Satandid plainly acknowledge himself overcome bythe death of Christ, and could never give anyanswers afterwards.The words of Plutarch to Emilias the Oratorconcerning the matter, are as follows,“ My father coming by sea, towards Italy, andcoasting by night about an Island not inhabited,called Paraxis; when most in the ship were atrest, they heard a fearful voice which came fromthat Island, that called upon Alaman, who waspilot of the ship, and an Egyptian born, thoughthis voice was heard once or twice, yet no manhad the courage to answer it till the third time,when the pilot answered, who is there ? Whois it that calls ? What would you have ? Thenthe voice spoke more high, and said, Alaman,I require, that when you pass the gulph of Lan-guna, you remember to cry aloud, and make* them understand that the great god Pan isdead.” At these words, all in the ship were as¬tonished, and concluded that the pilot shouldnot take notice of the voice, nor stay in thegulph to utter such words if they could get be¬yond it. Now going in their voyage, and com¬ing to the place before-mentioned, the ship stoodstill, and the sea was so calm, that the*’ couldgo no further ; whereupon they resolved, thatAlaman should perform ttys embassage, so he11frlaccd himself upon the poop of the ship, antried aloud, be it known unto you, that th: i;reat god Pan is dead. When he had uttere ii Ihese words, they heard many mournful crier,;j;roans and lamentations, that continued somelime, which surprised those ia the ship ; butjiaving a prosperous gale, they followed the'utourse, arrived at Rome, and told the advenure ; and told Tiberius the Emperr, all thei ruth thereof.It is evident, that Satan in all parts was ba¬nished by the death of Christ, and it is supposedhat this'god Pan is not to ba understood onlySilks the god of the shepherds, but rather some mas¬er devil, who lost his power and empire as they -ill did at the death of Jesus Christ.About forty years after the death of Christ the‘Jews had many warnings shewn them from lion-!jVen. Before Vespasian came in the feist eipeeks: the priest heard a mhn walking in thejtemple, saying with a terrible voice, Cerm,let us go away out of this place, let us make■Jiiiaway from hence.”Now the sins of the Jews being come to theIjfull height, who with cruel hands had crucifiedsiiitlie Lord of Life, that innocent blood, whichfithey desired might fall on them and their chii-iidrcn, began now to be avenged upon them j forithe civil wars were begun by Jeholranan andSimon, who destroyed all the corn and fruits ]without the city, and Jehohanan within the cityravished the citizens’ wives and daughters, and jthe;! floods of innocent blood. The citizens.12being weary of this tyranny, delivered the cityto Simon, thinking he would help them, but heioined the other rebel, and they reigned month-about, till at last they quarelled between themselves.Then there was nothing but slaughter and.bloodshed, so that the blood of the Jews ran.through the streets even to the temple of theLord, like a flood : all that the seditious over¬came, they set their houses on fire, so that theyburnt fourteen hundred storehouses, that werelull of corn, wine, and oil, which caused a sud¬den famine in Jerusalem. Thus Goo visitedthe city with four plagues at once, viz. sword,pestilence, famine, and fire: to which the fifthwas added, the ruin and destruction of ail theglorious buildings, so that nothing but desola¬tion, pollution of the temple and all holy things,and uproar without any rest: no help, no suc¬cour, but every corner was full ofhowling, yel¬ling, weeping, wailing, sobbing and sighing of[. women, children, and aged men starving forwant of bread, and others roaring in theiri wounds; so that all manner of miseries cp-'-ressed the inhabitants, and he was thought anippy man who was dead before that day.At this time Vespasian, with his 'army, waslying at Galilee, and from thence he went toKoine to receive the Imperial Crown, anti left hisson Titus, with the half of his army to besiege jJerusalem, the other to tarry at Alexandria tillurfher orders. “That J shall do,” said Titino *1; , .13“ clefir father, for unto you it Lelongeth to conicsnand, and for me to obey.”In the first year of the reign of Vespasian Ti¬tus mustered his army, and found them sufficientfor the siege 6f Jerusalem. He then inarchedto Samaria, and from thence to Atelonia, thir¬ty furlongs from Jerusalem, where he pitchedhis camp, and the next day he brought histvhole army to Jerusalem, a little before thefeast of the unleavened bread, which was Aprilthel4th,sothatan infinite number|ofpeople, whocame to celebrate were all shut up in the cit}',which raised a famine ; oxen's dung was sold ata dear rate, so was old leather ; and some wo¬men for want, boiled their children and did catthem.Now Titus approached the walls of the city,and pitched his camp upon the liver Poleponia,raiseo a mount, and with a battering ram brokeinto the city, May 7th, and afterwards he raisedfour other mounts, and made himself master ofthe second wall, and i uilt twelve castles there¬on, so that none could pass in or cut, wherebythe famine and pestilence raged within, and thesword without the city, so that multitudes per¬ished ; for from April the 14th to July follow¬ing, there were buried by the common chargeof the city, 600, 000 carcases, and multitudesthrown into empty houses, and over the walls,which filled the houses with dead bodies.Titus intended to save the temple from fire,w hen some of the city were in flames, by settinga guard on it, but the seditious who raised thebe?14fire, slew every man of the guard, which Titusiiearing, brought his who'.e army thither. Atthat time a soldier of the seditious took a flam¬ing fire-brand, and cast it through the goldenwindow into the temple, and the others set fireto the doors, and after the gojd grew hot, thewhole fabric was in a flame, and the Holy ojHolies was laid open to the view of all therepresent.This happened in the second year of thereign of Vespasian, and the same month that itwas burnt by Nebuchadnezzar. Titus drew hissword to save the holy place, but the flamesrushed through all parts of the temple in a mo¬ment, so that none could save it. The Jewsseeing all go to destruction before their eyes,they then threw themselves into the flames,“ Why should we live any longer ? now thereis no terrvnlc.” After the Holy of Holies was .burnt, Tit’us entered it, and saw the glory of it,and said, CI well perceive that this is no otherthan the house of God, and the dwelling placeof the kins' of heaven : the God of heaven whois God of this house, take vengeance on the se¬ditious, whtfse heinous deeds have brought thisevil upon themselves and this holy place.'Ou the 7th of September Titus commandedall the lower city to be set on fire, and assaul- fted the upper city, breaking over their fences,and destroying all before him with fire andsword, then he commanded the city and templeto be razed to the foundation, and the ground•to be forthwith ploughed. And Jehohanan and15Simon were sent prisoners to Rome, with 706of the Jews: the book of the law and the pur¬ple veil of the sanctuary were taken in triumphto Rome, at that time neither sun nor moonappeared for fifteen days, as Christ foretold.St. Jerome writes that in his time, on thatday of the year wherein Jerusalem was taken bythe Romans, you might have seen aged menand women, and several other wretched people,who with blubbered cheeks and dishevellad hair,went howling and lamenting for the ruin of thetemple and sanctuary, wearing and bearing intheir habits and bodies the sad character of di¬vine veangeance, of whom the soldiers exacteda fee for liberty of weeping: and they who for¬merly sold the blood of Jesus, were now forcedto buy their own tears, without being pitied.The Roman soldiers being now quite spentwith doing execution, and having a great dealmore of their work yet to do. Titus orderedhis men to hold their hands, saving only to thosewhom they found armed, or in a posture of re¬sistance, and to give quarter to all the rest. Butthe soldiers went beyond their commission, andput the aged and sickly to the sword promiscu¬ously with their companions ; and for those thatwere strong and serviceable, they shut them upin the temple in the women’s quarter. Caesarappointed Fronto, one of his friend* and fre -men, to inform him of the people, and to do bythem as he deserved. As for the ruffians and theseditious, that impeached one another, ho hadthem all put to death ; but for men of comelyand graceful persons, and in the prime of their‘youth, he reserved them for the triumph j send¬ing away all above seventeen years of age to theremainder of them m chains in Egypt, to be em¬ployed in servile offices and drudgery, besides ||those that were distributed up and down the pro-1|vihees for the use of the theatres in the quality Jof swords-men or gladiators, all under seventeen j|he exposed to sale.In the mean time, while the prisoners were |under Fronto’s charge, there were 11000 ofithem starved to death, betwixt the churlishness |lof the keepers that would give them no meat, Ifand the snucamishness of their stomachs that «would swallow none. But in truth the mouths |were too many for the provisions.'I he number of the prisoners in this war was97000. The number of the dead was 110000 ;the greater part of them Jews by nation, thoughnot natives of Judea, for it was only a generalmeeting of them at Jerusalem, gathered togeth¬er from all quarters to celebrate the feast of thepassover ; who were then surprised into a war.There was such a prodigious multitude, andthey so straitened for lodgings, that the crowdfirst brought are plague into the town, and thenquickly made way for a famine. The city notbeing capable of entertaining that vast body ofpeople, if the calculation of Cestius may at leastpass fuv any thing, us follows.Kero had so great a contempt for the Jews,that Cestius made it his suit to the high prieststo bethink themselves of some way of number-17ng their people ; and this he did out of a desire:o give Nero to understand that the Jewish na-ion was not so despicable as he imagined ; sohat they took their time to enter upon theimputation, at the celebration of their paschaleast; when offering up a sacrifice to be eateniftenvavds, in the 9th hour of the day to the11th; and the sacrifice to be eaten afterwardsn their families by ten at least, and sometimes20, to a lamb, they reckoned upon 260, 500 ob-ations; which, at the rate of ten to a lamb,amounts to 2,665,000 persons, all pure and;ound, for neither lepers, scorcubites, mentroubled with gonorrhoeas, women in their mon-5;hly sickness, or people labouring under anymalignant distempers, were admitted to any part1 n this solemnity ; no more were any strangers;jut what came thither for religion. So that:his mighty concourse of people from abroad be¬fore the siece, were afterwards bv the riphtecusprovidence of God, cooped up in that city as inIP .prison ; and the number of the slain in thatBiege was the heaviest judgment of that kind,hat ever wras heard of. Some were killed open-y, others kept in custody by the Romans, whoiiearched the very sepulchres and vaults for them,band put all they found alive to the sword. Theren.vere upwards of 2000 that had either laid vio-ent hands on themselves, or killed one anothery consent, besides those that, perished by theamine. The putrid corruption of dead bodiesent out a vapour to poison as many as cameithin the reach of it. Some were not able to\isehduro it, and so went out of the way; othershad their hearts so set upon booty that they ri¬fled the very carcases} and trampled upon the |dead bodies as they hfy soaking in their corrup¬tion, but avarice sticks at nothing. Tiicy brought’out several prisoners also, that the two tyrantshad laid in chains there; they kept up theircruelty to the last : but God’s justice overtookthem both in the end ; for John and his breth¬ren, in the vaults, were now driven by the dis- ,|tress of an insupportable hunger to beg that J|mercy of the Romans, which they had so often idespised ; and Simon, after a long struggle with 'an insupportable necessity, delivered up himself.The latter being reserved for the triumph, andthe former made prisoner for life. The Romansafter this burnt the remainder of the city, and .threw down the walls.dTe power of God on the one hand and hi!/goodness on the other was very remarkable ohthis occasion ; for the tyrants ruined themselvesbv quitting those holds of their own accord, thatcould never have been taken but by famine; andthis after the Jews had spent so much time to nopurpose upon other places of less value. Bythese means the Romans became masters of threeimpregnable forts by fortune, that could neverhave been taken any other way; for the three,famous towers before mentioned, were proofagainst ell battery,Upon Simon and John’s quitting these tow- |ers, or rather jipon their being driven out ofthem, by the impulse of judicial intatuationy |19they hastened away to the vale of Siloa, wherethey took breath a while, and after some recol¬lection and refreshment, they gpve an assault tothe new wall there ; but so fxnt and weak thatthe guard beat them off, for between fatigue, de¬spondency, dread and misery, their strength fai'-dthem, and they were then scattered several waysin sinks and gutters.The soldiers were now broken loose ail overthe town, up and down in the streets, with theirswords drawn, killing all that fell in their way-without distinction, and burning entire housesand. whatever war, in them, in ene-corwmnn flame.In several places where they entered to searchfor pillage, they found whole families dead andhouses cram mod with hunger-starved carcases,so that upon the horror of so hideous a, spectaclethey came out again ernnty handed: but thecompassion they had for the dead, made themnot one jot tenderer to the living, for they stab¬bed every man they met, till the narrow passagesand alleys were choaked up with carcases ! sothat the channels of the city ran blood as if ithad been to quench the fire. In the eveningthey gave over killing, and at night they fell a-fresh to burning.The eighth of the month Gorpiens put an endto the conflagration of Jerusalem, (A. D. 70.)and if all the blessings it ever enjoyed from thefoundation of it, had been but comparable inproportion to the calamities it suffere.d in thissiege, that city bad been undoubtedly the envyof tho world. But. the greatest plague of svM?/came out bf its own bowels, in that infernal raceof vapours that it brought forth to cat out thebelly of the mother.While Titus was now taking a view of therains of this gloriov-s Tty, the works, the forti¬fications, and especially the turrets which thetyrants had so ■sottishly abandoned : while Cae¬sar, I saV, was entevtainimj himself in the con-templations of these towers, the design, work¬manship and curiosity of the fabric, with thewonderful contrivance of the whole, he let failthis expression, ‘ Well, says he, if God had not‘ fought for us and with uS, we could never have‘ been masters of these forts. It was God, in'‘ fine, that assisted us., and that fought against‘ the Jews, for this was notan undertaking to‘ be compassed with bands or machines.’This wras in fine the issue of the siege ; andwhen the soldiers had neither ranine nor blood¬shed for their spleen to work upon, (as theywould not have been idle, if they had matter,)Titus ordered them to lay the city and templelevel with the ground and to leave nothing stand¬ing, but the three famous turrets, Pasael, Kippi-cos, and Mariamne, that overtopped all the rest.;and a piece of wall to the westward of the town,where he designed a garrison. The towers toremain so many monuments to posterity of theRoman’s power and conduct in taking them.This order was punctually executed, and all'therest laid so flat., that the place looked as if ithad never been inhabited. This was the endof the Jerusalem sanction ; a mad and seditious>eople, and also the end of the most glorious!:ity in the universe.What is here chiefly remarkable is this, thatno foreign nation ever came thus to destroy ther Jews at any of their solemn festivals from thedays of Moses till this time; but came nowupon their apostacy from God, and disobedienceto him. Nor is it possible, in the nature ofthings, that in any other nation such vast num¬bers should be gotten together, and perish inthe siege of any one city whatsoever, as now hap¬pened in Jerusalem.Thus was Jerusalem taken and utterly de¬stroyed, in the 2d year of Vespasian, and on theeight day of the month Gorpieus ; having beenfive times taken before, i. e. by Azchreus kingof Egypt, Ahtiochus Epiphanes king of Syria,Pampey, Herod, with Sosius, who did all pre¬serve the city after it was taken. But Nebu¬chadnezzar, the king of Babylon, laid it wastel.°>65 years, 8 months and 6 days after the buil¬ding of it.The first Founder of it was a CanaanitisHprince called Melchizedec, which in the He¬brew language signifies a just king, for such washe in an eminent manner. He first dedicatedthe city to God, erceled a temple in it and ofii-eiated in the quality of priest, giving it the nameof Jeursalem, which before was called Solyma.When David, the king of the Jews, cameafterwards to drive out the Canaanites, he plant¬ed his own people there; and in 477 years,and 3 months aftei this, it was laid waste by theBabylonians.22From the reign of David there, to the destruction of the city by Titus, it was 1179 years, and2179 from the foundation of it. And those whoafterwards ww it, could not believe that everthere had been such a city there; yet the de¬spised Jews begged leave to build part of thecity ; but after 65 years, when they began torevolt, then Elius Adrianas the Emperor,*slew |many thousands of them ; and when his furywas over, he took one part of the city withoutthe wall, Mount Calvary, and Christ’s sepulchre,and made a spacious city, which he called afterhis own name, Selia Capitolia, which was inha¬bited by all nations, but most by Christians, for500 ye:(rs. And in 639 it M'as taken by theEgyptians and Saracens, who held it 400 years,and in 1039, it was regained by Godfrey Bol-logn, who being elected king, refused to becrowned with a crown of gold, where Christwas crowned with a crown of thorns.—It con¬tinued to him and his successors eighty-eightyears, till in 1127, it was taken by Saladine,king of Egypt; and in 1517, the Turks took it,who are still masters of it, and called it, in theirown language, Gunembare, or tire Holy ofHolier.FINIS*'■ yINSTANCE OFTURKISH JUSTICE.fh Groceii of the city of Smyrna had a son,who, with the help of the little learning thecountry could afford, rose to the post of naib, ordeputy to the Cady, or major of the citj-, and assuch, visited the markets, and inspected the weightsand measures of ail retail dealers. One day, asthis officer*was going his rounds, the? neighbours,who knew enough of his father’s character to sus-pect that he might stand in need of the caution,advised him to remove his weights for fear of theworst: but the old cheat depending on his rela¬tion to the inspector, and sure, as he thought thathis son would not expose him to a public affront,laughed at their advice, and stood very calmly athis shop door, waiting for his coming. The naib,however, was well assured of the dishonesty andunfair dealing of the father, and resolved to de¬tect his vi!lanjr and make an example of him ; ac-_ cordingly, he stopt at the door, and said, coolly tohim, “ Good man, fetch out jTour weights, thatwe may examine them.” Instead of obeying, thegrocer would have fain put it off with a laugh, butwas soon convinced his son was serious, by hear¬ing him order the officers to search his shop, andseeing them produce the instruments of his fraud,which, after au impartial examination, were open¬ly condemned and broken to pieces. His shameand confusion, however, he hoped would pleadwith a son to excuse him all further punishment ofhis crime, but even this, though entirely arbi-trai'y, the naib made as severe as for.the most in¬different offender, for he sentenced him to a fineof fifty piasters, and to receive a bastinado of asmany blows on the soles of his feet. All this wasexecuted on the spot, after which, the naib leapingfrom his horse, threw himself at his feet, and wa¬tering them with his tears, addresses him thus:“ Father, I have discharged my duty to my God,my sovereign, my country, and my station ; per¬mit me now, by my respect and submission, toacquit the debt I owe a parent. Justice is blind,it is the power of God on earth, it has no regardto father or son, God and our neighbour’s right,are above the ties of nature, you had offendedagainst the laws of justice, you deserved this pun¬ishment, you would in the end have received itfrom some other. I am sorry it was your fate toreceive it from me ; but my conscience would notsuffer me to act otherwise: behave better for the fu-tuerand instead of blaming me, pity my beiegredite-ed to so c.uel a necessity.” This done, he mount¬ed his horse again, and fhen continued his jour¬ney, amidst the exclamations and praises of thewhole city, for so extraordinary a piece of justice;report of which being made to (he Sublime Forte,the Sultan raised him to the post of Cady ; f romwhence by degrees, he rose to the dignity of Mufti,who is the head of both religion and law amongthe Turks. Were cur dealers in email weightsto be dealt with according to the Turkish law, thepoor might not be so much imposed upon as theyare now.

He neither mercy had, nor fear.Yet this did not his wrath allay,For others he did seek to flay.Cubine and Gordon, near Iljrd-bill,He took their life, their blo&d to spili;And left them hanging en a tree,For dis bedience to me.John Bell of Whiteside he did flay.And would not give him time to pray ;And other four, in that same hour.He fhot upon Kirkconnel~muir.Mayfield, Clement, and JrUngtovm,Jfacrtbet he brought also d*nvn ;Aad made them all a sacrifice,Hi# heliifh fury to appeafe.Two men in Twingbam fome did find.And with hair-tethers did them bind.Like fheep for flaughter there they lay,George Short, and David flalliday ;Till Lag came up, and gave commandTo kill them quickly out hand.Againlt them he had fuch defpite,He would not let them live one night;So in that ptpftare they were fhetM c^pelly upon the fpot!Lacblane and Wilson in the feaHe drown’d, ’caufe they obey’d not me!Tho’ they were of the weaker fex,No favour they of him did get:Unto a (lake he did them tie,Because they did my laws deny,And cruelly he t •wk the lifeBoth of a young maid and a wife'( 23 )Thus Lag did conquer in the field,Such as to me would no ways yield.When Perfecuting did delay,He ferv’d me well another way.He ever loyal was and true,And his ftllegiance did renew;And for my fake did hatred bearTo many a perforv far' arid near.The Kirk by excommunication,Did banifii him cut of their region,'Becaufe he would not fatisfyThem for his vile adultery :Of this fentence he was content,Pie never play’d the penitent;For he no ill in it could fee,Since they deliver’d him to me;For fie knew well that I could tholeHis vices all, without controul;That he fhould have both peace and e*se,In doing things that I do please.Altho’ they frighted him with terror,He was not brought to fuck an error,As to for fake his former way,Or in the leal! from me to ilray.Fie clave as clofe unto my lawAs any man I ever faw:In atheism his days did fpend,Until his time drew near an end ; 4Then, for the faf]\Un. he did fay,That he was of rjie Pv>pifh way,Becaufe a Pried made nim believe,1 hat he to him would pardon give,And would from Purgatory bringHim to a place where he would fing:*( 24 )But that was but * forged lie,For Lag lives hot and bien with me:It was in fpite he monty gaveUnto the Priefl, that greedy fkve;For he had neither pith nor powerTo keep my friend from me an hour;For when I heard that he was dead,A legion of my den did leadHim to my place of relidence,Where ftill he’ll ftay, and net go hence;For Purgatory, I muft tell,It is the loweft place ifa hell;And from that place they ne’er win free,Tho’ greedy Priefts for gain do lie,In making ignorants conceive,They’ll bring them from the infernal cave,Such as do bribe them well with gold,As heaven with pdf were bought and iold.Sure that is but a vain deceit,‘ Contriv’d by Antichrilf of late,'TV keep the worfhippers of the WhoreSenfeltfs in fin, blind and fecure,And to make Priells lo- k fat and fine,Who nought but carnal things d<> mind.This Lag will know, and all the reft,Wb ot my lodgings are psfleit:On earth n.. m^re they can ferve me.But fiyi I have their company ;With this I mufc mv grief allay,So I no more of Lac will fay.FINIS,Fslkirk-~-T, Johnston^ Printer,

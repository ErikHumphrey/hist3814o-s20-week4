farevvel! dear Caledonia’s ftrand,“ Rough though thou be, yet Hill my native land,“ Exil’d from thee I feek a foreign Ihore,“ Friends, kindred, country, to behold no more :“ By hard Oppreffion driv’n, my helplefs age,“ That fhould ere now have left Life’s buftling ftage,“ Is forc’d the ocean’s boift’rous breaft to brave,“ In a far foreign land to feek a grave.“ And muft I leave thee then, my little cot!“ Mine and my father’s poor, but happy, lot,“ Where I have pafs’d in innocence away,“ Year after year, till Age has turn’d me grey ?“ Thou, dear companion of my happier life,« Now to the grave gone down, my virtuous wife,“ ’Twas here you rear’d with fond maternal pride,“ Five comely fons : three for their country died !« Two ftill remain, fad remnant of the wars.Without one mark of honour but their fears ;“ They live to fee their fire denied a grave,“ In lands his much lov’d children died to fave :“ Yet ftill in peace and fafety did we live,“ In peace and fafety more than wealth can give,<< My two remaining boys, with fturdy hands,“ Rear’d the fcant produce of our niggard lands :“ Scant as it was, no more our hearts defir’d,“ No more from us our gen’rouslord requir’d.“ But ah,fad change! thofe bleffcd days are o’er,« And Peace, Content, and Safety charm no more.arr"'.^- — ( 5 )Another lord now rules thofe wide domains,The avaricious tyrant of the plains,Far, far from hence he revels life away,In guilty pleafures, our poor means mull pay.The moffy plains, the mountain’s barren brow,Mull now be tortur’d by the rearing plough,And, fpite of nature, crops be taught to rife,Which to thefe northern climes wife Heav’ndenies.In vain, with fweating brow and weary hands,We llrive to earn the gold our lord demands,While cold and hunger, and the dungeon’s gloom,Await our failure as its certain doom.“ To fhun thefe ills that threat my hoary head,“ I feek in foreign lands precarious bread ;Forc’d, tho’ my helplefs age from guilt be pure,“ The pangs of banilh’d felons to endure ;“ And all becaufe thefe hands have vainly try’d“ To force from art what nature has deny’d ;“ Becaufe my little all will not fuffice“To pay th’ infatiate claims of Avarice.“ In vain, of richer climate's I am told,“ Whofe hills are rich in gems, whofellreams are gold,“ I am contented here, I ne’er have feen“ A vale more fertile, nor a hill more green,“ Nor would I leave this fweet, though humble cot,“ To lhare the richelt monarch’s envied lot.“ O!

fad alternative to chufe,“ Come, Banifhment, I will no more refufe.“ Go where I may, nor billows, rocks, nor wind,“ Can add of horror to my tortur’d mind ;“ On whatfoever coaft I may be thrown,“ No lord can ufe me harder than my own ;“ Even they who tear the limbs and drink the gore,“ Of helplefs ftrangers, what can they do more ?“ For thee, infatiate chief! whofe ruthlefs hand“ For ever drives me from my native land :« For thee Heave no greater curfe behind,“ Than the fellbodings of a guilty mind ;“ Or what were harder to a foul like thine,“ To find from avarice thy wealth decline.“ Foryou,myfriends,andneighbours,ofthevale,“ Who now with kindly tears my fate bewail,« Soon may your king, whofe breailpaternal glows,“ With tendereft feelings for his peoples woes,“ Soon may the rulers of this mighty land,•“ To cafe your forrows ftretch the helping hand}( 7 )“ jE,lfe foon, too foon, your haplefs fate fhall be,“ Like me to fuffer, to depart like me.“ On your dear native land, from whence I part,“ Reft the heft blefling of a broken heart.“ If in fome future hour, the foe Ihould land“ His hoftile legions on Britannia’s ftrand,“ May Ihe not then th’ alarum found in vain,“ Nor mifs herbanilhed thoufands on the plain.“ Feed on, my fheep, for though depriv’d of me,“ My cruel foes {hall your protectors be,“ Fortheirown fakes, (hall pen your ftragglingflocks,“ And fave your lambkins from the rav’ning fox.Feed on, my goats, another now fhall drain“ Your ftreams that heal difcafe and foften pain ;“ No ftreams, alas ! can ever, ever flow,“To heal your mailer’s heart, or foothc his woe.“ Feed on, my flocks, ye harmkfs people, feed,“ The worft that ye can fulfer is to bleed.“ O ! that the murderer’s ftccl were all my fear !“ How fondly would I ftay to pevifli here—“ But, hark 1 My fons loud call me from the vale,“ And, lo !

in whole tranfparent waveMy youthful limbs I wont to lave ;No torrents ftain thy limpid fource,No rocks impede thy dimpling courfe.That fweetly warbles o’er its bed,With white, round, polilh’d pebbles fpreadWhile, lightly pois’d, the fcaly broodIn myriads cleave thycryftal flood.The fpringing trout, in fpeckl’d pride ;The falmon, monarch of the tide ;The ruthlefspike, intent on war ;The filver eel and mottley’d par,Devolving from thy parent lake,A charming maze thy waters make,By bow’rs of birch, and groves of pine,And hedges, flow’r’d with eglantine.Still on thy banks, fo gaily green,May num’rous herds and flocks be feen ;And lafles, chanting o’er the pail;And Ihepherds, piping in the dale ;And ancient faith, that knows no guile,And induftry imbrown’d with toil;And hearts refolv’d, and hands prepar’d.The bleffings they enjoy to guard !* # * * *

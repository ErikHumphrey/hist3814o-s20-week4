FAR, FAR AT SEA,The Huge Oak,TOM BO WL TNG,The Sailors Adieu.I knew by the Smoke, ~Woes my heart that we should sunder,HOW STANDS THE GLASS,ANDSEE THE ROSY MORN APPEARING.SOI.D WHOLESALE EY J, FRASEU ii CO,PRTNTEJA8, STIRLIHC. f* & SCOTLAND riFAR, FAR AT SEA.Twas night when the bell had toll’d twelve,And poor Susan was hid on her pillow,In her ear whisper’d some fleeting elve—•Your love now lies tost on a billow,Far, far at sea.All was dark, when she woke out of breath,Not an object her fears could discover;All was still as the silence of death,Save Fancy, which painted her lever,Far, far at sea.‘So she whisper’d a prayer—clos’d her eyes,But the phantom still haunted her pillow,While in terror she echo’d his cries,As struggling he sank in a billow,Far, far at sea.ERE AROUND THE HUGE OAK.i '■< .. • S3 •Ere around the huge oak that o'ershadows yonmill,The fond ivy had dat’d to entwine;Ere the church was a ruin that nods on the hil),Ere a rook built his nest on the pine,3Could I trace back the time, a far distant date,Since my forefathers toil’d in this field; [tate.And the farm I now hold on your honour’s es-Is the same that my grandfather till’d.He, dying, bequeath’d to his son a good name.Which unsullied descended to me;For my child I’ve preserv’d it, unblemish’d withshame,And it still from a spot shall be free.THE SAILOR’S EPITAPH.Here, a sheer hulk, lies poor Tom Bowling,The darling of our crew;No more he’ll hear the tempest howling,For death has brought him to.His form was of the manliest beauty,His heart was kind and soft;Faithful below he did his duty,But now he’s gone aloft. *Tom never from his word departed,His virtues were so rare;His friends were many, and true-hearted.His Poll was kind and fair;And then he’d sing so blythe and jolly.Ah! many’s the time and oft!But mirth is turn’d to melancholy,For Tom is gone aloft.Yet •‘.hall poor Tom find pleasant weatler,When He, who al! commands,Shall give, to call life’s crew together,The word to pipe all hajids.Thus Death, who kings and tars dispatebes,In vain Tom’s life has do/F’d,Tor tho’ his body’s under hatches.His soul is gone aloft.THE SAILOR’S ADIEU.The topsails shiver in the wind.The ship she casts to seatBut yet my heart, my soul, my mind,Are, Mary, moor’d with thee:For though thy sailor’s bound afar,Still love shall be my leading star.Should landmen flatter when we’re sail’d,O doubt their artful tales;No gallant sailor ever fail’d,If Love breath’d constant gales.Thou art the compass of my soul,Which steers my heart from pole to pole.Sirens in every port we meet,More fell than rocks or waves;But such as grace the British fleet,Are lovers, and not slaves.5No foes our courage shall subdue?, -Although we leave our hearts with you.These are our cares; but if you’re hind,We’ll scorn the dashing main,The rocks, the billows, and the wil d.The power of France and Spain.Now Britain’s glory rests with you;Our sails are full—sweet girls adieu.THE WOODPECKER.I knew by the smoke that so gracefully curl’dAbove the green elms, that a cottage wasnear; f world,And I said, ‘ if there’s peace to be found in theA <heart that is humble might hope for ithere.’Every leaf was at rest, and I heard not a sound.But the Woodpecker tapping the hollow beechtree.‘ And herein this lone little wood,’ I exclaim’d,4 With a maid who was lovely to soul and toeye; [if I blam’d;Who would blush when I prais’d her, and weepHow blest could I live, and how' calm couldI die.’Every leaf, &c.* By the shade of yon sumach, whose red berrydips [dine,In the gush of the fountain, how sweet to re-And to know that I sigh’d upen innocent lips.Which ne’er had been sigh’d on by any butmine.Every leaf, &c.Woes my heart that vcc should sunder. .With broken words and downcast eyes,Poor Colin spoke his passion tender;And, parting with his Lucy, cries,Ah! woes my heart that we should sunder.To others I am cold as snow.But kindle with thine eyes like tinder;From thee with pain I’m forc’d to go;It breaks my heart that we should sunder.Chain’d to thy charms, I cannot range;No beauty new my love shall hinder;Nor time, nor place, shall ever changeMy vows, tho’ we’re oblig'd to sunder.Ye powers, take care of my dear lass,That as I leave her I may find her;When that bless’d time shall come to pass,We’ll meet again, and never sunder.The image of thy graceful air,And beauties which invite our wonder;7aThy lively wit, and prudence rare,Shall still be present, tho’ we sunder.Dear nymph, believe thy swain in this.You’ll ne’er engage a heart that’s kinder;Then seal a promise with a kiss,Always to love me, tho’ we sunder.HOW STANDS THE GLASS AROUND.How stands the glass around?For shame, ye take no care, my boys;How stands the glass around?Let mirth and wine abound.The trumpets sound,The colours they are flying, boys.To Tight, kill, or wound,May we still be foundContent with our hard fate, my boys,On the cold ground.Why, soldiers, why,Should we be melancholy, boys?Why soldiers, vd\y.Whose business ’tis to die!What—sighing?—fie;Don’t fear, drink on, be jolly, boys;’Tis he, you, or I—Cold, hot, wet, or dry,We’re always bound to follow, boys,And scorn to fly.8*’Xis but in vain,I mean not to upbraid you, boys)Tis but in vainFor soldiers to complain:Should next campaignSend us to ’dm who made us, boys,We’re free from pain;But if we remain,A bottle and kind landladyCure all again.ROSY MORN.When the rosy morn appearing,Paints-with gold the verdant lawn,Bees, on banks of thyme disporting,Sip the sweets and hail the dawn.Warbling birds the day proclaiming,Carol sweet the lively strain;They forsake their leafy dwelling,To procure the golden grain.See, content, the humble gleaner,Takes the scatter’d ears that fall:Nature, all her children viewing,Kindly bounteous, cares for all.FINIS.

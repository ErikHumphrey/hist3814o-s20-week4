I•But to its bounties he paid no regard,Converting it into a large court-yard.In semicircle form he laid it out,And encompass’d it with a wall about.With flow’r-pots, too, he did it ornament,His mind ok pleasure being greatly bent.A fine portico with five steps was made.19Which to a'hfge and stately hall did lead.More than a hundred feet this hall was square,,And lined well with,the good cedar fair.Twelve marble pillars did the same support.With curious cov’rings like some princely court.It cornic’d was, by active skilful hands,Like to the doric and ionic plans.The deling lofty was, and very grand,And smoothly finish'd by the workman’s hand.(And on the same was letter'd o’er with paint,A tale which heathens did of old invent:And on each side an avenue right neat,' Led to a range of parlours quite complete.But, to he short, the house was built in haste.f He likewise furniture, to suit the same,1 Had long bespoke, to aggrandize his name.Those who his income knew, now wonder’d much| By what strange means he had become so rich;p Tea, some were so surpris’d when they did hear it,I’They said he had compact with some ill spirit;* The secret then they did not understand,That vain Adulphus had mortgag’d his land.He this had done, and got what he did needI To deck his bow’r, but still kept close the deed.20Likewise, to shew himself a prudent man,He In his mind conceiv’d a singular plan;Accordht? to his dream, a day h* set,That he would pay each Fraction of his debt;His artificers and his working men,Were to attend, or have themselves to blame ;The day arriv’d, his frien-Ts he did combine.To'see him now in a prodigious line;To view his debts discharg’d by that great pelf,Which yet was kept a secret to himself.Now view them seated round his coast! y board,And feasting as if with some gallant lord;While many tradesmen round his dwelling hums;All fondly waiting their respectave sums.The hour of five did now begin to beat,The very time that hite dream phantom set»Tho’ then engag'd, resolving to get free.He left his seat and to the door did flee ;In empty stile he gave his hand a wave“ Your pardon, friends, I for a moment crave.”Unto his closet then great haste he made.In hopes to meet with this uncommon aid.In great suspense he waited there till six,But nothing found, which did somewhat perplex ;21»[Yet as deludon still empower’d his mind,[He yet believ'd that he the store would find;,'\nd thought himself the only guilty man;'or calling comp’ny had defeat the plan,rle order'd all his tradesmen to depart.And come to-morrow as the sun did start.Then to his friends again he did resort.And spent some hours in iovial mirth and sport.(They being gone} then all to peace was hush’d,lie thought the hour had come he long had wish'd.To Bed he went, and fondly did believe.That thirty thousand pounds he’d now receive.He in his room did place a shining light.That nothing might obstruct th6 pleasant sight.% *I But tho’ he slept no Benefactor came,I'Which made him dread his vain deceitful dream;! Yet in rhe dreary midnight’s sullen gloom,[He thought he heard a rustling in his room ;jThen sudden joy flutter’d in his breast,| And from his bed he "springs in eager haste;; He crept along, his feet behind he drags.And searched ev’ry corner for the bags.But no strange visian to him did appear,.Nor golden coin his tortur'd mind to cheer, j22His gn?f was now extreme, his sorrow great!While self-reproach within himself did fret.Far from his eye-lids sleep did now depart,And morning sun struck terror to his heart;His tradesmen came; he bade them yet delay,And put it of until another day.They did consent: then he himself to screen,Did disappear, not wishing to be seen ;He in his room next dav himself inclos'd.And.sent them word that he was indispos'd;But conscious of the long fore-boded blast,They poor Adulphus into jail did cast;Possessions now' were sold by legal grant,And him transported to the doors of want;The’ freed from prison, he was now reduc'd,Which great distraction to his mind produc'd;His substance gone, and all his prospects chang’dDistress’d him so he turn’d quite derang’d;In raving niadness he did then reveal,That secret which so long he did conceal,Which unto ruin brought him very fast,And caus’d him turn a lunatic at last;In kindness then to Bedlam he was sent,And with the dismal place seem’d quite coatent;23But sudden languor seiz’d him as a prize,And in short space death shut his weary eyes.How many mortals like Adulphus vain,Aspire at greatness which they ne'.ei attain,Yea, many seem right busy all their days,Grasping at Meteors which they never seize.When Reason sleeps, imaginations then,Produce strange phantoms in the minds of men;But tho’ night dreams make us sometimes to quake,The danger lies in dreaming while awake.24A SIMILE.The crazy vessel in the flood.That hath great billows oft withstood.In past revolved years ;Now •worn sore out with leaks and chinks*Each wave that beats she deeper sinks :At last she disappears.So human fntines when days begin,grow stout by nature’s cup ;Cut when old age sets winter in,they soon are swallow'd up.F I N I S.4

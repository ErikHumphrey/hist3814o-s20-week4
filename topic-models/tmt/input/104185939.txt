J t : w; at * [ j c. *i l J f I j v ;; t /And spread the table neat and clean.Gar ilka thing look braw ;It’s a’ for love of my gudeman,For he’s been lang awa.Sae true his heart, sae smooth his speech.His breath like caller air,His very foot has music in’t,When he comes up the stair.And will I see his face again ?And will I hear him speak ?I’m downright dizzy wi’ the thocht.In troth I’m like to greet.The cauld blasts o’ the winter wind,That thirl’d through my Inart,4They're a’ blawn by, I ha’e him safe,Till death we’ll never part.Hut what puts parting in my head ?It may be far awa ;The present moment is our ain,The neist we never saw.Since Colin’s weel, I’m weel content,I hae nae mair to crave ;Could I but live to mak’ him blest,I’m blest aboon the lave.And will I see his face again ?And will I hear him speak ?I’m downright dizzy wi’ the thocht,In troth, I’m like to greet.HEY THE BONNIE BREAST KNOTS.Hey the bonnie, ho the bonnie,II ey the bonnie breast knots ;Blythe and merry were they a’When they put on their breast-knots.There was a bridal in this town,And till’t the lasses a’ were boun’,Wi’ mankie facings on their gown,And some of them had breast-knots.Singing, hey the bonnie, &c.5At nine o’clock the lads convene,Some clad in blue, some clad in green,Wi’ shinin’ buckles in their sheen,And flowers upon their waistcoats.Singing, hey the bonnie, &c.Out cam’ the wives a’ wi’ a phrase,And wish’d the lasses happy days,And muckle thought they o’ their claise,Especially the breast-knots.Singing, hey the bonnie, &c.JOHN O’ BADENYON.Where now the trees are budding green.And flowers bloom on the lea,The time I us’d to meet my love,Beneath yon spreading tree.My happy days it brings to mind.But, ah! those days are gone :—Yet still I’ll tune the pipe I gotFrae John o’ Badenyon.For my false love he prov’d untrue,And left me here to mourn ;And often wet wi’ ev’ning dew,I’ve sat beneath this thorn.I’ve wander'd here, I’ve wander’d there,But rest I could find none.Until I met beneath this shade,Wi’ John o’ Badenyon.6Why is tii., face o’ercast with woe.He said, or why oppressed ?Should worldly care, or hapless love,E ’er rob thy youth of rest!He tun’d his pipe, and play’d sae sweet,He gart my cares stand yon’;I bless the day 1 chanc’d to meetWi’ John o’ Badenyon.’Twas he first taught my youth to sing,And weave the rustic lay,And to his pipe the woods would ringThe lee lang summer day.Nane had sic art to soothe my heart,But now, alas ! he’s gone,For nane could ever play or singLike John o’ Badenyon.tf>/o{ vjif j oi fv^ji I tunii o; iHe, dying, gave to me this pipe,On which he us’d to play ;Be thou its second lord, he said.And soothe thy care away ;And seize each op’ning bud of joy,That blooms the thorns among ;So, dying said, he left this scene—Dear John o’ Badenyon..mod i U >ti ill -: *>V 1I laid his head beneath the yird.And dew’d it wi’ a tear ;I often wander near the spot.For he to me was dear.7Now spring’s green mantle clothes the field,But, ah ! I sing alone ;For spring’s green mantle clothes the graveOf John o’ Badenyon.■ 'LASSIE wr THE LINT-WHITE LOCKS.Lassie wi’ the lint-white locks,Bonny lassie, artless lassie.Wilt thou wi’ me tent the flocks?Wilt thou be my dearie, 0?Now Nature deads the flow’ry lea,And a’ is young and sweet like thee ;0 wilt thou share its joy wi’ me,And say thou’lt be my dearie, 0 ?Lassie wi’ the lint-white locks, Ac.And when the welcome simmer show’rHas cheer’d ilk drooping little flow’r.Well to the breathing woodbine bow r.At sultry noon, my dearie, 0.Lassie wP the lint-white locks, &cWhen Cynthia lights, wP silver ray,The weary shearer’s hameward way ;Through yellow waving fields well stray,And talk o’ love, my dearie, 0.Lassie wi’ the lint-white locks, &c.8And -when the howling wintry blastDisturbs my lassie’s midnight rest;Enclasped to my faithfu’ breast,I’ll comfort thee, my dearie, O.Lassie wi’ the lint-white lochs, &c.iooj htiiiw tzij am i f at?.-- aSOMEBODY.My heart is sair, I darena tell,My heart is sair for somebody ;I could wake a winter night,For the sake of somebody.Och hon, for somebody!Och hey, for somebody !I could range the world around,For the sake of somebody.Ye pow’rs that smile on virtuous love,O, sweetly smile on somebody!Frae ilka danger keep him free.And send me safe my somebody.Och hon, for somebody!Och hey, for somebody!I wad do—what wad I not?For the sake of somebody.

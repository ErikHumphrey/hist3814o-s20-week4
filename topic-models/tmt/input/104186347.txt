Never was anyperlon heard of that could worft him : ray, thevery learned many tunes he baffled, by .his cunning,fliarp, and ready inventionFor inftance, .when he was no more than feveayears of age, bis father, the farmer, fent him intothe field, to look after his oven, which were theq |feeding in apleafant pafturc A country Vicar hychance, one day, coming acrofs the field, calledJack, and sliced him feverai .quellions, in particular.How many commandments wer£ there ?

His habitation•was a cave in the pridd of the mount, neither wouldhe fufier any living creature to inhabit near Vm :Lis feeding was upon other man's cattle, whichoften became his prey, for wLenfosver he had oc~.cafion for foe/, he would wade over to the mainland, where he would furnifi* liu&fclf tvhh whatev¬er he could find. For the people, at ids approach,would forfake their habitation : then he would taketheir cows and oxen, of which, he would make no¬thing to carry over on his back, half a Uozen at atime : and as for the fncip &nd hogs, h; would tieItlicm round his vudfl like a bunch of oandeliers.This he had for many years pracaied in Cornwall,which was very much impoveriihed by him.But one day corning to the town hall, when theMagillrates were fitting in confternatiou about theGiant, he afkecl what reward they would give toany perfbn that would deftroy him l Fhey anfwered, ahe fhall have all the Giant's treafure in recompence. ^Qopth Jack, then I myfeif will endertake the work./4How Jack flew ibis Giant, and got the nemo ofJack the Giant Killer.JACK having undertaken this he furnilhedhimfeif with a horn, a ihovel, and a-pick axe, andover to the mount he goes in the'beginning of adark winter evening, where he fell to work, andbefore morning, had digged a pit two and twentyfeet deep, and aim-nil as broad, andlame over with longed a little of the movnulike the plain ground.This done, places himfeif on the contrary J’ fide of the pit, juft about the dawning of the day,when putting his horn to his mouth, he then blewTan tvvivie, tan twivie. Which unexpected noiferoufed the Giant, who came roaring towards Jaccr *ng out, You incorrigible villain, are you , come•^hither to diftuvb my reft, you {hall dearly pay forit: fatisfaction I will have, and it {hall be thiswill take you wholly, and broil you for my break-covered thflicks and flrnw : then ftrew-upon it, fo that it appeared |faft.—Which words were no iooner out of hismouth, but he tumbled headlong into the deep pit,foundation of thewhole heavy fall made the veryMount to fhake.Oh ! Giant, where are you now ? Faith, your aregot into fmb’s pond, where I fhall plague you foiyour threatening words. What do you think now olbroiling me for your breakfaft ? Will no other di¬et ferve you, but poor Jack ? Thus having tantr'.ia-ed the giant for a while, he gave him a moil weighty knock on the crown of his head, with his pickaxe, fo that he immediately tumbled down, gave ;moil dreadful groan ar.d died This done, Jaci-threw the earth in upon b m, au'J fo buried himthen going and fearching the cave, he fouod a greaquantity of tivafure.5i ■ ■ - •Nott, when the Magiftrates who employed hirn}heard the work was over, they fenf for him, declar¬ing, that he fhould henceforth he called, Jack the, Giant Killer. And in honout-thereof, they prefent-: ed him with a ftvord, together with a tine rich em¬broidered belt, on which tkefe words were wrought: in letters of gold,Here’s the right valiant Corhifh man,Who flew the Giant Cormillan.! Hoiv Jack-, ’while a/Icep, was taken by h Giant)and hew he get his liberty again.,! rT'1UE n*ws of Jack's victory was foon fpr'eadj X over all the we'ftern parts ; when another‘I huge Giant, named Biunderboar, hearing of it, vow-i ed to be revenged on Jack, if ever it was his fortune,itp light upon him. This Giant kept an enchantedJcatlle, fituated in the midft of a loncfoaie wood yNow Jack, about ferar mctiths after, walking-near thri;i borders of the faid wood, on his journey towardsijl Wales, grew very weary, and therefore fat himielf: down by the (We <*t a plea fan t fountan, where aj deep deep luddehly feiaed on him, at which timer,i the Giant coming thiiher for water, found him,band- by the lines written on his belt, knew him tojjl-be he who killed his brother Giant, and therefore,; without making any words, he threw him uponhis Ihoulder, to carry him to his enchanted vaftle.! Now, as they paffed through the thicket, the rufflingof the boughs awaked Jack, who, finding himfelfin the clutches of the Giant, was ftrangely fur-prifed, yet it was but the beginning of his terrors:for at the entering within the firft wj.ils of the caf-jjtle, he beheld the ground all covered with'bones, and’» [jfculls of dead men, the Giant telling Jack, that his';bones would enlarge ;he member that he uw. ThisI I11ffaid, he brought him into a large parlour, where hebeheld the bloody quarter of iome who were latelyflaia, and in the next room were many hearts andlivers, which the Giant, to terrify Jack, told him,** That men’s hearts and livers were the choiceft of« his diet. For he commonly, a< he'faid, ate them 1** with pepper and vinegar, adding, that he did not•{ queftion but his heart would make him a daintybit ” This faid, he locks up poor Jack in an up¬per room, leaving him there, while he went to fetchanother Giant living in the fame wood, that hemight be partaker in the pleafure which they wouldhave in the deftruction of poor Jack.Now, while he was goue, dreadful flirieks andcries affrighted Jack, efpecially a voice which con¬tinually cried,Do wLat you can to get away,,Or you’ll become the Giant’s prey :He’s gone to fetch his brother, whoWill kill and likewife torture you.This dreadful nolfe fo amaz’d poor Jack.that he wasready to run dillracted, then feeing from the windowafar off, the two Giants, coming thither, now, quothJack to himfelf, death or deliverance is at hand.. There were ftrong cords in the room by him, ofwhich he takes two, at the end of which he makes anoofe, and while the Giant was unlocking the iron-'gate, he threw the ropes over each of their heads,,!:and tken drawing the other acrofs the beam,,where he pulled with all his main ftrength, until hehad throttled them; and then faftening the rope tothe beam, turning towards the window, where he:beheld the two Giants to be black in their facesthen Hiding down the rope, he carire clofe to theirheads, where the helplds Giants could not defendthemfelv^s ; aud drawing out his fworu, flew themboth, and delivered hinifdf from their intended-era-JJil*city : Then taking the bunch of key?, he unlocked.l| the rooms, where, upon a ftrict fearch, he foundJ three fair ladiei, tied by the heir of their heads, al¬ii mod; ftarved to death, who told Jack, that their kuf-i bands were flain by the Giant, and that they were, 1 kept many days without food, in order to force themI to feed upon the fledi of their hhfbands; which they■j j could not, though they fnould be ftarved to death.i Sweet ladies, quotli Jack, l have deftroyed thismonfter and his brutifn brother, by which i haveobtained your liberties. This faid, he prefentedff| them with the keys of the caftlc, and to proceeded| on his journey to Wales.Hszo Jack travelled into Fiinijhire3 and zvhathappened.JACK having but very little money, thought itprudent to make the bed: of his way by travel¬ing as fafr ns he could, but lovsng his road, was be¬nighted, and could aot get a place cf entertainment,until he came to a valley, placed between two hills,where flood a large haute in a lonsfome place, andby reafon of his prefent condition, he took courageI to knock at the gate, and to his furprife, there cameforth a motillrous Giant, having two heads, yet hedid not feem fo fiery, as the others had been, for he; ?was a Welch Giant, and what he did, was by privatei and fecret malice, under the faife fliew of friendfhip :ofor Jack, telling his condition, he bid him welcome,i fhewing him a room with a bed hi it, whereuponshe might take his night’s repofe. Therefore Jackn undreffiid himlelf, and as the Giant was walking toi another apartment, Jack hears him mutter forth..i tkefe words to himfelf,Though here you lodge with me this night,You lhall not fee the morning light,My dab fhall dafh your brains outriyl hsSave ft theu To, qnot'li Jack, thii is like Tome of yourWelch tricks, but I hope to be cunning enough foryou. Then getting cut of bed, he put a biliet in hisHead, and hid himfelf in a'corner of the room, ami ,in the dead time of the night, the Welch Giant ;came with his great knotty club, and ftruck fever a lheavy blows upon the bed where Jack laid the billet,and then returned to his own chamber, (uppoiing hehad broke all the bones in .his body.In (he morning, Jack gave him hearty thanks for 1Ins lodging. The Giant (aid to him, How have youreftrd i1 Did you not feel fometting in tha night ?Nothing, quoth Jack, but a rat which gave me two. jor three flaps with her tail. Soon after, the Giantrofe and went to breakfaft with a bowl of hafty pud¬ding, containing near four gallons, giving Jack thelike quantity ; who, being loch to let the Giant knowhe could not eat with him, got a large leathern bagjputting it very artfully under his loofe coat, intowhich he fecretly coeveyed his pudding, telling theGiant*he could fliew him a tricky -hen taking aknife, he ripped open the bag, which the Giant fup-pofed to be his belly, when out came the hafty pud-•ding, at which the Giant cried out, Cots plut, barcan do dat trick hurfelf. Then taking his fharpknife, he ripped up his belly, from the bottom tothe top, and out dropped the tripes and trolly bags,ib thatvhur fell down dead. Thus Jack outwittedthe Giant, and proceeded on his journey.How King Arthur's Son, going to feck kisfo:tunexmet with "Jack, c.KING Arthur’s Son only ddired of his f.ither to 1furnilh him with»a certain fum of money, thathe might go and feek his fortune in the principallyof Wales, where a beautiful Lady lived, whom he9heard, was pofTefTed with feven evil fpirits; but, theKing, his father, arfviied him utterly sgainft it, yethe would cot be psrfnaded oft'it: fo that he grant¬ed what he requefted, which was one horfe loadedwith money, and- another for himfelf to ride on.Thus he went forth without any attendants.Now, after feveral days travel, he came to a mar¬ket town in Wales, where' he beheld a large cor-courfe of people gathered together ; the King’s fondemanded the reafon of. it, and wus told, that theyarrefled a corpfe for many large fums of money,which the deeeafed owed when he died. The Kiny/sfon replied, “ It is a pity that creditors fhould be fo« cruel, [f6 bury the dead, faid he, and let his crc-ditors come to my lodging, and their debts fhall.« be difeharged ” Accordingly they came, and infuch great numbers, that before night, he had almoftleft himfelf moneylefs.Now, jack the Giant Kilier being there, and fee¬ing the generofity of the King’s fon, he was takenwith him, and defired to be bis, fervarit. It was a-greed upon, and the next morning they fet forward,when riding out at the town-end, an old womancalled after him, crying out, “ He has owed metwo-pence thefe five years; pray, fir, pay me as wellas 'he reft ” He put his hand imo his pocket, andgave it her, it being the laft he had left, f he King’sion, turning to Jack, • faid, I cannot tell how I willfubfift in my intended journey. For that, quothJack, take you no thought nor care, let me alone,1 warrant you, we will not want.Now Jack having a fmall fpell in his pocket,which ferved at noon to give them a refrelhment,when done, they had not one penny left betwixtthem •, the afternoon they fpent in travel and fa¬miliar difeourfe, till the fun began to grow low, atwhich time the King’s fon faid, Jack, fince we haveno nisntVj where can we think to lodge this night ?Jack replied, Mafler, we’ll do we!: enough, for I havean uncle lives within two little nvles of this ; lie’s ahuge and movflrous Giant, with three heads: he’llfight five hunched men in- armour, and make themto fly before him. Alas ! quoth the Icing’s foil, whatfhall we do there ? he’ll certainly chop us both up atone mouthful! nay, we are fcarce enough to fill oneof his hollow teeth. It is no matter for that, quothJack, 1 myfelf will go before, and prepare the wayfor you, therefore tarry here and wait my return.He waits, and: Jack rides full fpeed, when comingto the gates of the caftle, he knocked with fuch aforce, that he made all the neighbouring hills to re-feund. The Giant, with a voice like thunder, roar¬ed out, Who’s there ? He anlwered, none but yourpoor coufin Jack. He replied, clear uncle, heavynews, God wot Prithee, what heavy news can cometo me ? I am a.Giant with three heads, afcd feefides,*hou knoweft, I can fight five hundred men in ar¬mour, and make them iiy like chaff before the wind.O ! but, quoth Jack, here’s the king’s fon corningwith a thoufand men in armour, to kill ydu, and foto deltroy all that you have! Oh ! coufui Jack,this is heavy news-indeed : I have a large vault un¬der the ground, where I will immediately hide my¬felf, and thou fhalt lock, bolt, and bar me in, and,keep th« keys till the king’s fon is gone.Now Jack, having fecurcd the Giant, he foon re¬turned and fetched his maftcr. They were bothheartily merry with the wine and other dainties whichwere in the houl'e : fo that night they refted invery pleafant lodgings, whiift the poor uncle, theGiiftit, lay trembling in the vault under ground.Early in the morning. Jack furniflied his mailerwith a freih f’uppiy of gold and filvcr, and then fethim three miles forward on his journey, concluding,he was then pretty well out of the fmell of the Gi¬ant, and then returned to let his uncle out of theij hole, who alked Jack what he would give him, inl| reward, his caftle was not demolilhed. Why, quothJack, I defire nothing but the old coat and cap, to¬gether with the old rufty fword and flippers, whichare at your bed-head ? Quoth the Giant, thou flialthave them, and pray, keep them for my fake, forthey are things of excellent ufe The coat will keepyou invifible, the cap will fumifli you with know¬ledge, the fword cuts afunder whatever you ftrike,aud the fhoes are of extraordinary fwiftnefs, thefemay be ferviceab’e to you, and therefore, pray takethem with all my heart; Jack takes them, thankinghis uncle, and follows his mafter.I?How Jack faved his Maker's Life^ and droveibc evil Spiriis out of a Lady, he.JACK having overtaken his mafter, they foon af¬ter, arrived at the Lady’s houfe, who, finding the 1King’s fon to be a fuitor, flic prepared a banquetfor him, which being ended, flie wiped his mouthwith her handkerchief, faying, You muft Ihew methis one to-morrow morning, or clfe lofe your headf: and with that Ihe put i; into her own bofom.The lying’s fon went to bed very forrowful, butjack’s cap of knowledge inftructed him how to ob¬tain it. In the middle of the night, flie called uponher familiar fpirit to carry it to her friend Lucifer.Jack {bon put on his coat of darknefs, with his fhoesof fwiftnefs, and was there as foon as her; by rea-fon of his coat, they could not fee him. When fhe $entered .lie place, flie gave the handkerchief to oldLucifer, who laid h upon a fhelfj from whenceT 2Jack took, and brought it to his rna.#r, who Sirtr-td it to the lady the next day, and fo favcd his life.The next night the fainted the King’s fon, tellinghim he' mult Ihew her to-morrow morning, thelips that ?he k'ned lad this night, or lefe his head.Ah ! fakl he, if yon kifs none but mine, i will i hisneither he'-e nor there, faiJ fne, if you do not, dcatliis your portion. At midnight, fne went as before,and was angry w'-.h I ucifer for letting the hand¬kerchief go. But now, faid ihe, I will be too hardfor the Kin.ys fon, for 1 will kits thee, and he’s tofhew thy lips, which, fhe did. Jack ftanefing nearhim with his fwerd of fharpnefs, ent off the devil’shead, and brought it under his ir.vifible coat.to hisotafi-er, who was in be t, and Jaid it at the end cf hisbolder. In the morning when the lady came up,he pulled it out by the horns, and fhewtd her the•devil’s lips which fhe killed laid.Thus, having anfv.-ered her twice, the enchant¬ment broke, and the evil fpirits left her; at.whichtime, fhe appeared in all /.er .beauty, a beautiful andvirtuous creature. They were married the nextmorning, in great pomp and folemnity, and foon•after, they returned with a numerous^ company tothe court of King Arthur, where they were receiv¬ed with the greaiM joy, and loud acclamations bythe whole court, jack, for. the many and great ex¬ploits he had done for the good of his country, wasmade one of the Knights of the Round Table.Thus we have finifhed the first part of this hif-toiy, which now leads us to the fecond, whereinvon have a more full .account of the many valrant'adventures of this great and valiant Hero, Jack theCiant Killer.tW) OF THE FIRST F4RT.*3' Tii£ 8£C0ND PART.\\lhiv yack, by Ki>ry Arthur''s leave, went in'purfuit of Giants yet alive.! T ACK having been fuccefsful in all his undertakeI.? ings, rcfolved not to be idle for the future, but!t? perforin what fervice he could, for the honourIni his King and country, he humbly requefted ofthe King, his royal mafter, to1 fit him with a horfeand money, to travel in fearch of ftrange and newadventures : For, faid he, there are many Giantsyet alive in the remoteft part of the kingdom, andthe dominion of Wales, to the-unfpeakable da¬mage of your Majefty’s,liege fubjects ; wherefore,may it pleafe your Ivlajefty, to give me encourage¬ment, I doubt not, but in a fhort time, to cutthem c^Froot and branch; and to rid the realm oflithefe cruel Giants and devouring monfters of na¬ture.Now when the King had heard thtfe noble pro-upofitions ; and had duly coniidered the mifchievousipractices of thole bltiod-thirldy Giants, he imme-rdiately grafted what honeft Jack rci jeiled, and onrthe firft day oF March, being thoroughly furnifhedwith-all neceafl’aries for dais progrefs, he took hisileave, not or.ly of King Arthur, but likewife of allrthe trufty arid hardy Knights belonging to theJRound Fable, when, after much falutation and friend-Ijly greeting, they parted, the King and his nobles toftheir country palaces, and Jack the Giant Killer, tothe eager purfujt fortune’s favours, taking witl\him ti«- Cap of Knowledge, Sword of Sharpnefs,Shoes of Swiftriefs, and like wife the. Ir.vifible Coat,lithe better to perfect and" complete the dangerous.jonterprizes that lay- before him.  . ...14lioza yack flew a Giant, and deliverci a Knightand his Lady from death.JACK travelled over vaft hills and wonderful’mountains, when at the end of three days, hecame to a large and fpacious wood, through which hemuft needs pafs, where, on a hidden, to his greatamazement, he heard dreadful ftirieks and cries,,whereupon, carting his eyes around, to behold whatit might be, he beheld, with wonder, a Giant mill¬ing along with a worthy Knight and his fair Lady,whom he held by the hair of their heads in his hands,with as much eafs as if they had been but a pair ofgloves, the fight of which, meited poor Jack intotears of pity and companion. Wherefore he a-Jighted from off his horfe, which he left tied to anoak tree, and then putting on his invifible coat, un¬der which he carried his fword of fharpnefs, hecame up to the Giant, and though he made feveralpaffes at him, yet neverthelcfs, it could not reachthe trunk of his body, by reafon of his height, thoughit wounded his thighs in feveral places, but at lengthgiving him a Twinging rtroke, he cut off both hislegs, jurt below the knee, fo that the trunk of his"body made not .only the ground to fhake, but like-wife the trees to tremble, with the fotce of his fall,at which, by mere fortune, the Knight and the La¬dy efcaped his rage, then had Jack time to talk withhim, and letting his foot upon his neck, faid, Youfavage-and barbarous wretch, l am come to executeupon yo t the juft reward of your villany. /£;dwith that, running him through and through, themonfter lent forth a hideous groan, and yielded uphis life into the hands of the valiant conqueror,Jack the Giant Killer ; while the noble Knight andvirtuous Lady were both joyful Ipeftators of hisfudden downfal, and their owa.deliverance.IiThis b^ing done, the courteous Knight and hisfair Lady not only returned him hearty thanks fortheir deliverance, but alfo invited him home, thereto refrcfh himfelf after the dieadful encounter/asiljikewife to receive i'ome ample reward, by way ofgratitude for his good fervice. No, quotb Jack, Iteannot- be ?.t eafe till I find out the den, which wasilthis monfter’s habitation, the Knight hearing this,waxed right forrowtu!, and replied, noble ftranger,lit is too much to run a fecond rdk, for this notedimonfter lived in a den under yon mountain, with abrother of his, more fierce and fiery than himfelf,fijand therefore, if you fliould go thither and perifhin the attempt, it would be the heart-breaking of: both me and my lady, let me perfuade yoa to gotmvith us, and defift from any further purfuit : Nay,fjqtioth Jack, if there be another, nay, were there(twenty, l would flied the laft drop of blood in myhody, before one of them fhould efcape my fury,i snd when I have finifhed this talk, J will come: and pay my refpects to you. So taking directionsnto their habitation, he mounted his horfe, leavinglithem to return homo, while he went in purfuit oflithe deceafcd Giant’s brother. ,\]How yack fltw the other Giants and fent loththeir beads to King Arthur*ACK had not ridden part a mile and a half, beforehe came in fight of the cave’s mouth, near tolithe entrance of which, he beheld the other Giant^fitting upon a huge block of timber, with a knotty"iron club lying by his fide, waiting, as he fup-itpofed, for his brother’s return with his cruel prey.5iHis gbgie eyes appeared like terrible flames of fire,8 his countenance grim and ugly, and his cheeks ap¬peared like a couple of large fat flices of bacon.moreover, the briftles of his head fcemed to re- (femble rods of iron wire ; bis locks hui>g down up- 1on his broad ihoulders, like curled fnakes, ojr hif-' 'fing adders.Jack alighted from his horfe, and put him into f& thicket, then with his coat of darknefs, he camefpmewhat near to behold his figure, and faid foft-ly, Oh ! are you there ? ft will not be long before iI take you by the beard. The Giant, all this time, I.could not fee him, by reafon of his inviiible coat, focoming up clofe to nim, valiant Jack, fetching a 1blow at his head with his Iword, and miffing feme- Vwhat of his aim, *ut off the Gianf/s nofe, whofe nof- Itrils were wider than a pair of jack-boots, the pain 1was terrible, and fo he put his hand to feel for.his ! 'nofe, and when he could not find it, he raved and-iroared louder than claps of thunder, and though heturned up his large eyes, he could not fee fromwhence the blow came, which had done him thatgrdM difaller ; nevrrthelefs, he took up his iron-head¬ed club, and began to lay about him like one fturkmad. Nay, qaoth Jack, if you be tor that fport, /I will difpafch you qurcklty for fear of any acciden¬tal blow falling out. I hen as the Giant srofe frgmIds block, Jack make:: no more to do, but runs his ,(word up to the hilt in the Giant’s fundament, |where he left it fucking for a while, and ftooi "himfelf laughing with his hands a-kimbo, to fee ■the Giant caper and dance the canaries, with the .fwr/d in his arfe, crying out, he fhould die, hefhould die with the griping of his guts.: Thus did 'the Giant continue raving for an hour or more, andat length fell down deau, whofe dreadful fall hadlike to have crufhed poor Jack, had he not beennimble enough to avo'dit.This being done, Jack cut off both theheads, and lent them both to King ArthuGiant’sr, by a»7 .j waggoner, whom he hired for the purpofe, togetheri ij with an account of his profperous fuccefs, in all hisundertakings.Hew Jack fearched their Cave, and deliveredmany out of Captivity.T ACK having thus difpatched thefe two manflers,J refolved with himfelf to enter the cave, in fearchof thefe Giants' treafure : he paffed along through; many turnings and winding?, which led him at length'to a room paved with free-ftone, at the upper end,of which, was a boiling caldron ; then on the righthand, flood a large tabic, whereat he fup|iofed theGiants ufed to dine, then he came to the iron gate,where was a window fecured with bars of iron,through which he looked, and there beheld a vaftatapy mifercble captives, who feeing Jack at adiftapee, cried out with a loud voice, Alas ! youngman, art thou come to be one among us in this m*-ferable den ? Ay, quoth Jack, I hope I fhaU riV belong here •, but pray, tell me wkat is the nwtaningof your captivity ? Why, faid one of them, I’ll tellou, we are pi Tons that have been taken by theGiants that keep this cave, and here we are kepttill fuch time as they’ve dccrifioa for a good featl,and then the fatteft among us is Ilaughtered, ai\dtcprepared for their devouring jaws; it is not long“fincethey took three of us for the fame purpofe:Nay, many are the times they’ve dined on murder¬ed men.

And in teftimony of the truth ofwhat he had faid, he unlocked the iron gate, fet-ting the miferable captives at liberty, who all re¬joiced like condemned malefactors, at the light ofa reprieve: Then leading them together to the a-ji,forefaid room, he placed them round the table, andfet before them two quarters of beef, as alfo, breadand wine, fo that he feafted them very plentifully;fupper being ended, they fearched the Giani’s coc- *fers, where, finding a vaft {tore of gold and filver, yJack equally divided it amongft them"; they all re- Iturned him hearty thanks for their treafure andmiraculdus deliverance That night they went to |their reft, and in the morning they arole and de- h.parted, the captives to their refpecrive towns, andplaces of abode, and Jack, to the Knight’s houf",whom he had formerly delivered frem the hand of fthe Giant.How Jack came to the Knight's Houfet and Usnoble entertainment there, If c.IT was about ftm-rifing, when Jack mounted his f.horfe to proceed on his journey, and by the help >of his directions, he came to the Knight’s home feme »time before noon, where he was received with alldemonflrations of joy imaginable, by the Knight andhis Lady, who in an honourable refpect to Jack, pre¬pared a feaft, which lafted for many days, inviting (;all the gentry in the adjacent parts, to whom the ,worthy Knight was pleafed to relate the manner ofhis former danger, and the happv deliverance bythe undaunted courage of Jack the Giant Killer, andby way of gratitude, he prefented him with a ringof gold, on which was engraven, by curious art, theplChire of the Giant dragging a diftrellcd Knight andhis fair Lady by the hair of the Lead, with this mottorWe were in fad di ft refs you fee*Under a Giant's fierce command.But gain'd" our lives and liberty.By valiant Jack's vittorious hand.Now atnongtt the vaft aflembly there prefent,i were five ag> d gentlemen, whs were fathers to{ij fome of thefe miferable captives, whom Jack hadlately f«t at liberty; who, underftanding that hei was the perfon who performed thefe great wonders,; immediately paid him their venerable refpects :i After which, their mirth increafcd, and the find¬ing bowl went freely round to the profperous fuc-cefs of the viftorious conqueror. But in the midftf all their mirth, a dark cloud appeared, which1 daunted all the hearts of this a {Terribly.Thus it was, a meflenger brought the difmaltidings of the approach of one Thunderful, a hugeGiant with two heads; who, having heard of thedeath of his kinfiaan, the above-named Giant,was come from the northern pole in fearch ofJack, to be revenged on hit* for their moft terribledownfal, and was within a mile of the Knight’sfeat, the country people flying before him, from1 their houfes and habitations, like chaff before thew-nd. When they had related this, Jack, notwith a tool to pick his teeth, and you gentlemenc and ladies, walk but forth into the garden, and;jyou fliall be the joyful fpectators of this monftrousil Giant’s death and deftruction. To which tjiey alloaconfented, every one wifhirrg him good fortune, inil that great and dangerous enterprize..1 How yack overthrew the Giant on the Moat, andcut cjf both hii heads, &c.THE fituation of the Knight’s houfe, take asfoliov/s: It \v?.s placed in t^e midft of a20ftnall ifland, encompaffed round with a vaft moaf ithirty feet deep, and twenty feet wide, over whicflay a draw bridge Wherefore Jack employed twcmen to cut it on both fides, almofl: to the middleand then drefling himfelf in his coat of darknef;likewife putting on his fhoes of fwiftnefs, he march¬ed forth againft the Giant, with his fword. clfharpnefs ready drawn, yet when be came ctofeto him, the Giant could not fee him, by reafon oihis inviflble coat, which he had on, nevertheld.s hwas fenfible of fomc approaching danger, which madhim cry out,Fe Fi Fo Fum,I fmell the blood of an Englifhman, •Be he living, or be he dead,I’ll grind his bones to mix my breg.d.Say’ft thou fo, quoth Jack, then thou art a mon-ftrous miller indeed; But how, if J ihould lervethee, as I did the two Giants of late, in my con-fcience I fliculd fpod your practice for rhe luture.At which time the Giant fpeke wish a voice asloud as thunder; Art thou that villain which de-flroyed my two kitfmen ? Ihen I will tear theewith my teeth, fuck thy blood, and what is more,I will grind thy bones to powder. Yet^mult catchme firft, quoth Jack, and with that he threw ohhis coat of darknefs that the Giant might fee himclearly, and then ran .from him as through fear.The Giant, with foaming mouth and glaring eyes,following after like a Walking caftlc, making thefoundation of the earth as it were to fhake atevery ftep, Jack led him a dance three or four timesround the Moat, that belonged to the Knight'shoufe, that the Ladies and Gentlemen might takea full view of this huge monfler of nature, whofollowed Jack with all his might, but could not o-vertaJce him, by reafon of his ihoes ol fwiftnels,Id21which carried him faft* than the Giant could foi-"ilow... At length Jack, to finilh the Work, took o-itjver the bridge, the Giant with full Ipeed purfuing"after him with his iron club upon his fhoulder,ibut coming to the middle of the draw-bridge, when,I'wkh. the weight of his body, and the moft dread¬ful heps he took, it broke down, and he tumbled[into the water, where he roll’d and wallow’d like a^,whale, Jack, handing at the fide of the moat, laugh’d *at the Giant, and find, you told me you would grindimy bones to powder, here you have water enough,pray where is your mill ? The Grant fretted andJjfoanoed to hear him feoff • t that rate, and though hejplunged from place to place in .the moat, yet heXould not get out to be revenged on his adverfary.jack at length got a cart rope, aiyi caff it over theGiant’s two heads with a flip knot, and by the help||of horfes dragged hint out agakj, with which he was'ilneas ftnsngled, and before he would let him loofie,jhe cut ofl’ both his beads with his fvvord of iharp-:iuefs, in the full vk’w of all the woi^.ty afiembly-of‘Knights, Gentlemen, and Ladies, who gave a joy-sful fhout when they faw the Giant fairly difpatch-:cd.

Yes, ft.;the old man, if thou wilt accept of fuch accommodation as my poor cottage will afford, thou fhnibe right welcome. Jack returned him many thankfor his great civility, wherefore down they fat together, and the old man began to difeourfe him 3follows : “ Son, faid he, l am fenfibis "thou art thgreat conqueror of Giants, and it is in thy poweto free this place of the country from, an intoler*ble burden which we groan under: For behold, rufon, on the top of this mountain, there is an erchanted caftle kepi by a huge monffrous Giannamed Galligantus, who, by the help of au old corjuror, betrays many Knights and Ladies into thftrong caftle, where, by Magic Art, they are tran:formed into fundry fhapes and forms, but abo^ljall, I lament the lad misfortune of a Duke’s daugf]ter, whom they fetched from htr father’s gard?by art, carrying her through the air in a mourmrchariot, drawn, as it were, by two fiery dragonand being fecured within the walls of the caff!fhe was immediately transformed into the real fhagiof a White Hind; though many worthy Knighhave endeavoured to break the enchantment, arwork her deliverance, yet none of them could acomplifh this great work, by reafon of two dreaful Griffins, who were fixed by Magic Art, at tilentrance of the caftle gate, who deftroys any,foon as they fee them, but yoij, my bon, beir.|furnilhed with an Invifible Coat, may pafs by theundifeover^d, where on the braren gates of tS23Icaftte, ycu wi'4 find engraven, in large characters, themeans by whk.. .ne enchantn-ent may be brokenThis old man having ended his difcourfe, Jackgave him his hand, ivith a faithful promife, that intha morning he would venture his life to break theenchantment, ayd free the Lady, together with the:)reft that were miferable partners in her calamity.Btw Jack got into the Enchanted CaJIie ; brokethe Enchantment ; killed the Giant ; put theConjuror to flight; fet free the Knights andLadies: Likezvife the Duke's Daughter, whomhe afterwards married.HAVING refrefhed themfelves with a fmallrnorfcl of meat, they laid them down to reft,and in the morning, Jack arofe and put on his In-li.ifible Coat, his Cap of Knowledge, and Shoes of■Swiftnefs, and ft> prepared himfelf for the dangerouslipjterprife..

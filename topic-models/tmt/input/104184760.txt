This is no mine ain Lassie, fr/EDINBURGH:ited for the Booksellers in Town and Country.The Soldier's Adieu.Adieu ! adieu ! my only life.My honour calls me from thee ;Remember thou’rt a soldier’s wife.Those tears but ill become thee.What though by duty I am caH’dWhere thund’ring cannons rattle,Where valour’s self might stand appal’d:When on the wings of thy dear love,To Heaven above thy fervent orisons areThe tender prayer thou put’st up there.Will call a guardian angel down.To watch me in the battle.My safety thy fair truth shall be.As sword and buckler serving ;My life shall be more dear to me.Because of thy preserving :Let peril come, let horror threat.Let thund’ring cannons rattle.I’ll fearless seek the conflict’s heat.Assur’d, when on the wings of love.To Heav’n above, &c.Enough, with that bcnignjmt smile.Some kindred god inspir’d thee.Who saw thy bosom void of guile.Who wonder’d and admir'd thee.I go, assur’d, my life, adieu!Tho’ thund’ring cannons rattle ;Tho’ murd’ring carnage stalk in view.When on the wings of thy true love,To Heav’n above, &c.3My Nannie, O.Behind yon hills where Lugar flows,’Mang moors and mosses many, O,The wintry sun the day has clos’d.And I'll awa’ to Nannie, O.The westlin wind blaws loud an’ shill;The night’s baith mirk an’ rainy, O;I’ll get my plaid, an’ out I’ll steal.An’ o’er the hills to Nannie, O.My Nannie’s charming, sweet, and youngNae artfu’ wiles to win ye, O ;May ill befa’ the flatt’ring tongueThat wad beguile my Nannie, O,Her face is fair, her heart is true.As spotless as she’s bonny, O ;The op’ning gowan, wet wi’ dew,Nae purer is than Nannie, O.A country lad is my degree.An’ few there be that ken me, O ;But what care I how few they be.I’m welcome ay to Nannie, O,My riches a’s my penny fee.An’ I maun guide it cannie, O ;But warl’s gear ne’er troubles me.My thoughts are a’ my Nannie, O.Our auld gudeman delights to view.His sheep and kye thrive bonny, O ;But I’m as blythe that bauds the pleugh.An’ has nae care but Nannie, O.Come weel, come wo, l carena by.I’ll tak’ what Heav’n will sen’ me, O;Nae ither care in life have I,But live, an’ love my Nannie, O.4Old Torvler.Bright Chanticleer proclaims the dawn.And spangles deck the thorn ;The lowing herd now quits the lawn.The lark springs from the com ;Dogs, huntsmen, round the window throng,Fleet Towler leads the cry ;Arise the burthen of their song.This day a stag must die.With a hey ho chevy.Hark forward, hark forward, tantivy, &c.The cordial takes its merry round.The laugh and joke prevail.The huntsman blows a jovial sound.The dogs snuff up the gale :The upland wilds they sweep along,O’er fields, through brakes they fly;The game is rous’d, too true the song.This day a stag must die.With a hey ho chevy,Hark forward, tantivy, &c.Poor stag, the dogs thy haunches gore,The tears run down thy face;The huntsman’s pleasure is no more ;His joys were in the chase.Alike the sportsman of the town.The virgin game in view.Are full content to run them down,Then they in turn pursue.With their hey ho chevy.Hark forward, tantivy, &c.5Tht Lammy.“ Whar hae ye been a’ day.My boy Tammy?Whar hae ye been a’ day,My boy Tammy ?”* I’ve been by bum and flow’ry brae.Meadow green, and mountain-gray,Courting o’ this young thing.Just come frae her mammy.’“ And whar gat ye that young thing,My boy Tammy ?”' I gat her down in yonder howe.Smiling on a broomy knowe,Herding ae wee lamb and eweFor her poor mammy.’'vWhat said ye to the bonny bairn,.

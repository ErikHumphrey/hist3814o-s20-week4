I cannot—I cannot part from thee.The anchor’s weigh’d—farewell! farewell ! re¬member me!Weep net, my love, I trembling said;Doubt not a constant heart like mine.I ne’er can meet another maidWhose charms can fix my heart like thine.Go, then, she cried, but let thy constant mindOft think of her thou leav’st in tears behind,A maid—this last embiace ray pledge shall be.The anchor’s weigh’d—farewell! farewell! re¬member me I7OH! SAY NOT WOMAN’S LOVE ISBOUGH l\Oh ! say not woman’s love is boughtWith vain and empty treasure;• Oh ! say not woman’s heart is caughtBy ev’ry idle pleasure.When first her gentle bosom knowsLove’s flame, it wanders never ;Deep in her heart the passion glows—She loves, and loves for ever.Oh ! say not woman’s false as fair;That like the bee she ranges,Still seeking flowers more sweet and rare,As fickle fancy changes.Ah no ! the love that first can warm,Will leave her bosom never;No second passion e’er can charm—She loves, and loves for ever.JOCK OF HAZELDEAN.« Why weep ye by the tide, lady ?Why weep ye by the tide ?I’ll wed ye to my youngest son,And ye sail be his bride.And ye sail be his bride, lady,Sae comely to be seen:”—But aye she loot the tears down fa’For Jock o’ Hazeldean.8««Now let this wilful grief be done,And dry that cheek so pale ;Yeung Frank is chief of Errington,'And Lord of Langley-dale.His step is first in peaceful ha\His sword in battle keen:”—>But aye she loot the tears down fa’For Jock o’ Hazeldean. *“ A chain of gold ye sail not lack,Nor braid to bind your hair,Nor mettl’d hound, nor manag’d hawk,Nor palfrey fresh and fair.And you the foremost o’ them a’Shall ride, our fomnosi. queen —•But aye she loot the tears down fa’For Jock o’ Hazeldean.The kirk was deck’d at morning-tide—The tapers glimmer’d fair-—The priest and bridegroom wait the brideAnd dame and knight are there.They sought her both by bower aud ha'—Tne lady was not seen:She’s o’er the border, and awa’WV Jock o’ Hazeldean,FINIS,

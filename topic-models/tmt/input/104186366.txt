A NIGHT FRAE HAME,ORATION ON TEETOTALIZATION,ANDPARODY ON THE LAST ROSE OF SUMMER.PAISLEY:fl.’STED BT G. CiimWEM AND SON, 3iAW SiREET.1 842.A NIGHT FRAE HAME.I’ve been thinking, I’ve been thinking,I’ve been thinking a’ day lang,That yestreen when I was drinkingI was doing what was wrang.I gaed out yestreen at gloaming,To enjoy the caller air,And amang the fields gaed roaming,Simmer evening’s sweets to share.Fragrant zephyrs gently glidedO’er the flower-enamelled plain,Where wi’ Mercy, Peace presided,Far frae angry Strife’s domain.But as hamewards I was walkingI forgather’d wi’ a frien’,Wha in raptures fell a-talkingO’ the place where he had been.Thoughtlessly I listen’d to him,Till we reach’d a yill-house door,Where the soun’ o’ voices drew himTo where he had been before./33Little dreaming wha was wr„ him,I slept in to taste his cheer,But before that I could lea’ himI paid for my folly dear.Roun’ a board where jugs and glassesIn admired disorder stood,Sat a batch o’ downright asses,In a most uproarious mood.Sangs an’ cracks were intermingled,Laughter too set up her din ;Jugs an’ cans on crystal jingled,Doubtless thinking silence sin.For a wee I leuk’d disgustedOn the graceless roaring crew,Till the drink my brains adjustedTo the squud, for I gat fou*.Soon appeared, disguised as Pleasure,Riot, and we join’d her train ;Folly too our wits wad measure,And soon claim’d them as her ain.Prudence lang ere this had left us,No one had a thought o’ hame,For the drink had fairly reft usO’ what sober folk ca’ shame.4Conversation turn’d to roaring,Every ane wad hae his say,Save a party wha lay snoringThe effects o’ drink away.Contradiction wasna idleIn advising Strife to rise;And the tongue without a bridle,Food for passion soon supplies.Personal abuse now quicklySent her arrows every where,Till at last the blows fell thicklyOn the ribs o’ many there.Black een follow’d bloody noses,Oaths tremendous struck the ear ;This ane wi’ big words opposesThat ane, if he seems to fear.Braggarts never seem sae awfu’As when in a tavern brawl;Threats then some might think unlawfu’On a’ roun’ them they let fall.So yestreen, ’tween blows and boasting,Sic a night was never spent,Till at last the watch came posting,And broke up our tournament./35Broken glasses, prostrate tables,Thickly strew’d the yill-house floor,Telling mair than /Esop’s fablesEver told o’ Folly’s lore.Coats without lappels gave ssrrowTo their owners’ hearts I trou ;Others plainly felt neist morrowWad meet them wi’ faces blue.Watchmen took a dram, an’ tauld usTo be aff without delay,Or the lock-up wad infauld u%In its precious womb till day.Quickly was our bill presented—Landlords aye tak’ care o’ that—-And it was sae weel per cented.It soon cured us o’ our chat.Faces black wi’ blows grew blackerWhen they heard the landlord’s claim;Some were swearing by their makerThey noo ken‘t the worth o‘ hame.Fun, and even strife, subsided,Dullness on us laid her ban’,Tho’ without, by wisdom guided,Larks proclaim’d the cheering dawn.6Ane by ane we paid our quota,Ane by ane we stacher’d harae;An’ I’m vera certain not aSoul amang us but thought shame.O, ray head ! how lang will mortalsDare great Nature’s laws transgress ?Rushing headlong through the portalsThat lead to such wretchedness.But yestreen I left my dwellingWi* a mind serenely gay ;—Now ray vera een are tellingWhat a man for drink must pay.Temperance ! thy couch of rosesWisdom ever loves to share;While Intemperance reposesOn the thorny breast o’ Care.Shun, then shun the road to ruim,—Through the tavern’s gate it lies;And believe me, while so doing,On the wings of Joy ye’ll rise./37ORATION ON TEETOTALIZATION.Ye friends of moderation, who think a reformation,Of moral renovation, would benefit our nation;Who deem intoxication, with all its dissipation,In every rank and station, the cause of degradation ;Of which your observation gives daily demonstration:Who see the ruination, distress, and desolation,The open violation of moral obligation,The wretched habitation, without accommodation,Or any regulation for common sustenation ;A scene of deprivation, unequalTd in creation:The frequent desecration of Sabbath ordination,The crime and depredation, defying legislation ;The awful profanation of common conversation ;The mental aberration, and dire infatuation,With every sad gradation to maniac desperation :Ye who, with consternation, behold this devastation,And utter condemnation on all inebriation;—Why sanction its duration—or shew disapprobation,Of any combination for its extermination ?We deem a declaration that offers no temptation,By any palliation of this abomination,The only sure foundation for total extirpation,And under this persuasion, hold no communicationWith noxious emanation of brewer’s fermentation,Or poisonous preparation of spirit distillation,Nor any vain libation producing stimulation.To this determination we call consideration,And without hesitation, invite co-operation ;Not doubting imitation will raise your estimation,And by continuation, afford you consolation.For in participation with this association,You may by meditation, ensure the preservationOf future generation from all contamination.And may each indication of such regeneration,Be the theme of exultation till its final consummation.8• \ ( T ;•] .1 ; ,' v) ■ \ i : l\ ■PARODY ON THE LAST ROSE of SUMMER’Tis the last silver shilling.Left shining alone;All its lovely companionsAre melted and gone ;No coin of its kindred,No credit is nigh.To brighten our wishes.And drown the sad sigh!I’ll not leave thee, thou lone oneTo pine on the board ;Since the landlord desires thee.Go, swell thou his hoard.Thus foolish I scatterWhat should purchase bread.To pamper an idler,And gain a sore head.And soon I must follow—Finances decay;For now from before meThe stoup’s snatch’d away.When half-crowns are melted,And cruckies are flown,Ah! who would inhabitA tavern alone!

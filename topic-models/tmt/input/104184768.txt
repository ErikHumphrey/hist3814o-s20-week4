Besides these there are other lines, as theLine of Saturn, the Lever Line, and some others, butthese only serve to explain the principal lines.The chief line on which persons of the profession laythe greatest stress, is the Line of Life, or Life Lineas it is here called, which generally takes its risewhere the thumb joint plays with the wrist, on theinside, and runs in an oblique direction to the insideof the innermost joint of the fore finger. If the Lineof Life is crossed by other lines on or near the wrist,the person will meet with sickness in the beginning oflife ; you may judge if the person will live long, asthe longer the line, the longer the life.The next line of importance is the Line of Death,which separates the fleshy pnrt of the hand on thelittle finger side, from the hollow of the hand, runningin various directiims in different persons. If the lineis short, and runs even, without being broken ordivided, it shows that the person will enjoy a goodlength of days, and not be subject to many maladies ;but if it is interrupted, it evidently shows that theperson’s life will be endangered by illness, but by thecare of Providence will recover.The Table Line originates with the Life Line, atthe wrist, and runs through the hollow of the hand9'towards the middle finger. When the line is broad,strong, and well marked, it shows the person to be ofi sound constitution; peaceable, and contented mind;if it is broken it shows for every break, a violentinterruption to happiness; if these breaks happenawards the part next the wrist, the person will becrossed in love, and either be disappointed in theperson he has fixed his affections on, or be saddled withI a person of a disobliging temper, and a most audaciousi:and abusive tongue.The Girdle of Venus takes its course from thelextremity of the innermost joint of the little finger,.land forming a curve, terminates between the fore and1 middle fingers. When it goes on fair and well markedit shows that the person will be prosperous in love,i fair in his dealings with the fair sex, and be sincerelybeloved ; he will obtain a sweet tempered, faithful,ijand affectionate partner for life, with a fortune equalito his own ; but, if it be interrupted at its beginning| near the little finger, he will meet with early disappoint-I ments in love ; if towards the middle of the line, hei will ruin his health and injure his fortune by lasciv-i iousness ; if near the end, he will be foolishly amorousin his old age, still expecting to gain the heart of awoman, but never obtain it.The Line of Fortune strikes from behind the ball ormount of the fore finger, across the palm and Line ofLife, and loses itself in or near the fleshy part of the[hand on the little finger side. By its approach to thegirdle of Venus, shows that there is a great kindred[between them, and their distance from the extremitiesclearly point out that love is inconsistent with child¬hood and old age ; yet, in those where the cross linesapproach from the one to the other, near the ends,Kirove that the person was, or will be, susceptible ofove in childhood or old age.If the hollow palm of the hand, which some call thePlain of Mars, is full of cross lines running into eachother, the person will be of a humoursome, uneven,and testy temper, jealous and hasty, quarrelsome andfighting, and endeavouring to set others by the ears ;he will meet with very frequent misfortunes, and bearthem very uneasily ; whereas, if the hollow or palmof the hand has none but the unavoidable lines ; that10is to say, those that must unavoidably pass throughit, he will be of a sweet and amiable disposition, fullof sensibility, gratitude, and love, faithful, benevolentand kind, and though subject to losses, crosses, anddisappointments, will bear them with an even andagreeable temper; from this party chiefly, it isrecommended to persons to choose their companionsfor life, either for friendship or marriage.The mount, or ball of the thumb, bears a parti¬cular analogy to the event of a person’s life withrespect to disputes, quarrels, and law-suits; if thismount has many long straight lines, reaching from thethumb to the Line of Life, they show that the personwill have several personal encounters, either withhands, clubs, pistols, or swords, but if the lines arecurved and crooked, they will indicate law-suits, andaccording to the degree of crookedness, they will belong or short; but, if these lines end in a straightdirection towards the Line of Life, they will endprosperously, whether it be encounters or law-suits;if otherwise, they will be attended with an unfavourableissue ; the nearer to the Line of Life these lines begin,the later in a person’s life the quarrels or law-suitswill take place ; and the closer to the Line of Lifethey end, the later in life will they terminate.HOW TO TELL FORTUNES BY THEGROUNDS OF A COFFEE CUP..©OUR the grounds of coffee into a white cup, shake^ them well about in it, so that their particles maycover the surface of the whole cup ; then reverseinto the saucer so that superfluous parts may be drained,and the figures required for fortune-telling be formed.The person that acts the fortune-teller must bend thenthoughts upon the person who wishes their fortunetold, and upon their rank and profession, in order tcgive plausibility to their predictions. It is not to beexpected upon taking up the cup, that the figures willlibe accurately represented, and it is quite sufficient ifthey bear some resemblance to any of the followingemblems.The Roads.The roads or serpentine lines indicate ways ; if theyare covered with clouds, they are said to be nfalliblemarks of either past or future reverses. If theyappear clear and serene, they are a sure token of somefortunate chance near at hand; when encompassedwith very many dots, they signify an accidental gainof money, likewise long life.The Ring.The ring signifies marriage ; if a letter is near it, itdenotes to the person the initial letter of the name ofthe party to be married. Likewise, if the ring is ina clear part, it portends happy and lucrative friend¬ship. When surrounded with clouds, it shows thatthe person should use caution in the friendship he isabout to contract. If the ring appears at the bottomof the cup, it forebodes an entire separation from thei beloved object.The Leaf of Cloveb.The leaf of clover is here, as well as in ordinary life,a lucky sign. Its different position in the cup aloneit makes the difference; because, if it is on the top itli shows that good fortune is not far distant; but it issubject to delay if it is in the middle or at the bottom.Should clouds surround it, it shows that much disagree¬ableness will attend the good fortune ; if it is in aclear part, it prognosticates serene and undisturbedhappiness, as bright as the party could wish.The Anchor.The anchor of hope and commerce implies successfulbusiness carried on by sea and land, if on the bottomof the cup. At the top, and in the clear part, it showsConstant love and unshaken fidelity. In the thick andclouded part it also denotes love, but tinctured withthe inconstancy of the butterfly.Tue Serpent.The serpent is the emblem of falsehood and enmity,and is likewise the general sign of an enemy. On thetop, or in the middle of the cup, it promises to theconsulting party the triumph which he desires overhis enemy ; but he will not attain it so easily if theserpent be in the thick or cloudy part. By the letterwhich frequently appears near the emblem, the enemymay be easily guessed, as it makes the initial of hisname.The Letter.By letters we communicate to our friends eitherpleasant or unpleasant news, and such is the case here;if this emblem is in the clear part, it denotes thespeedy arrival of welcome news ; if surrounded withdots, it announces the arrival of a considerable remit¬tance of money; but, hemmed in by clouds is quitethe contrary, and forebodes some melancholy or badtidings of a loss, or some other sinister accident.The Coffin.The emblem of death prognosticates the same thinghere, ora least, a long and tedious illress, i iit be inthe thick and turbid part. In the clear it denoteslong life.The Clouds.If they be more light than dark, you may expect agood result from your hopes ; but, if they are black,you may give it up. Surrounded with dots, theyimply success in trade, and in all your undertakings;and the brighter they are, the greater will be yourhappiness.13Thk Sun.The sun is the emblem of the greatest luck andhappiness if in the clear ; but, in the thick it forebodesa great deal of sadness; surrounded by dots or dashes,denotes that an alteration will easily take place.The Moon.If the moon appears in the clear, it denotes highhonours; in the dark or thick part it implies sadness,which will, however, pass without great prejudice.But if it be at the bottom of the cup, the consultingparty will be fortunate both by water and land.Mountains.If it represents only one mountain, it indicates thefavour of people of high rank, but several of them,especially in the thick, are signs of powerful enemies ;in the clear, they signify the contrary, or friends inhigh life, who are endeavouring to promote the con¬sulting party.The Trees.One tree only, be it in the clear or thick part, pointsout lasting health; several trees denote that yourwish will be accomplished.The Child.In the clear it bespeaks innocent intercourse betweenthe consulter and another person ; in the thick part,excesses in love matters attended with great expenses;at the bottom of the cup, it denotes the consequenceof lubiqious amours, and a very destructive end.The Star.The star denotes happiness if in the clear part, andat the top of the cup : if in the clouded, or tiiick part,it signifies long life, though exposed to various vicissi-14tudes and troubles. If dots are above it, it foretellsgood fortune, wealth and high respectability. Severalstars denote so many good and happy children ; but ifsurrounded by dashes, it shows that the children willcause you grief and vexation in your old age, and thatyou ought to prevent it by giving them a good educa¬tion in time.The Dog.The dog being at all times the emblem of fidelity orenvy, has also a two-fold meaning here. At the top,in the clear part, it signifies true and faithful friends ;but, if surrounded with clouds and dashes, it showsthat those whom you take for your friends are not tobe depended on; but if the dog be at the bottom ofthe cup, you have to dread the effects of extreme envyor jealousy.The Lilt.If the emblem of the lily be at the top, or in themiddle of the cup, it signifies that the consultingparty, either has, or will have, a virtuous spouse ; if itbe at the bottom of the cup, it denotes quite thereverse. In the clear part, the lily further betokenslong life.THE TRUE METHOD OF TELLING APERSON’S FORTUNE BY CARDS.WAKE a pack of cards, and pick six of each sort out,the Eight, Nine, Ten, Knave, King and Queen,these being the most prophetic cards in the pack.Let the person who wishes to have his or her fortunetold be blindfolded. This done, let the cards whichyou have picked out be shuffled, and then dealt outsingly on the table, with their faces downwards. Thebandage being then taken of the eyes of the blindfoldedperson; he or she must take up one of the cards, thenu15by turning to the page containing the name of cardtaken up, two stanzas will be found under the name ;when by applying the following rule, any one’s truefortune may be known. The italic capital letter L atthe beginning of each stanza, stands for Lady, andthe G for Gentleman.The Eight of Diamonds.L.—Dear Miss, you seem mighty uneasy,And look on the cards with a frown;The conjuror wants not to tease ye,But all the bad fortunes you own.You are doomed to live an old maid ma’am,And never be blest with a man ;But have courage, and be not afraid ma’am,You’ll deny it to us if you can.G.—Cheerful, improve each fleeting hour,Alas ! they fly full fast;Do all the good within your powerAnd never dread the last.The Nine of Diamonds.L.—The English girl who draws this card,Will have no cause to fret;Yet if she thinks her fortune hard,She’ll struggle for a better :But if the same card comes again,Old Scotland’s curse attend her,And she may scratch and scratch again.Till grease and brimstone mend her.G.—111 fate betide the wretched man,To whom this card shall fall;His race on earth shall soon be run,His happiness but small,Disloyalty shall stain his fame,His days be marked with strife,Newgate shall record his name,And Tyburn end his life.16The Ten of Diamonds.D.—Peace and plenty will attend you,If I happen to befriend you ;Children, ten your lot shall be,A single one and three times three:But, if twins you chance to have,You’ll surely find an early grave.O.—Whate’er his endeavours, a man who gets thisShall a bachelor be all his life ;He never shall taste of the conjugal bliss,Nor ever be blessed with a wife.The Knave of Diamonds.L.—Madam, your fortune’s mighty queer,The conjuror discovers;To fools you’ll lend a listening ear,And knaves will be your lovers.G.—In Venus’ wars, on London plains,He’ll early spend his youth,The knave of diamonds if he gains,Nay, never doubt the truth.The Queen of Diamonds.L.—If this queen to an amorous widow shall come,She who lately interred a goodman,For a husband again she will quickly make room,And plague him as much as she can ;But let her beware how she trifles with him,Though she fooled with the sot that departed,For in that case, most surely, her hide he will tan,Till her ladyship dies broken-hearted.G.—The married man that draws this card,Will soon a cuckold be ;Nor let him think his fortune hardIn so much company.For out of twenty married pairs,Nearly all the country through,Nineteen at least, the horns must wear.And pray, why should not you.The King of Diamonds.L.—Alas ! poor girl, though I lament your fate,I cannot save you from a husband s hate ;A tyrant lord will rule you through your hie, _And make you curse the wretched name of wite(g._To lords and great people frequenting the court,This card will most suspicious prove,To the closets of princes they’ll freely resort,And be rich in their sovereign’s love.Yet to those of low rank no good it portends,But oppression and hardship foreruns ;Unkind will be all their relations and friends,Ungrateful, their daughters and sons.The Eight ok Clubs.L.—Little peevish crabbed elf,Fond of no one but herself ;Cross, and still for trifles striving,With her, truly there’s no living.Q' Though honest you look, and you may speak fair,Yet you know your a rascal in grain ;For sixpence, your soul to Old Nick you’ll swearBut he’ll send such a rogue back again.The Nine of Clubs.L —If this card you should draw, return it again,Be quick, ma’am, and take my advice ;For its only predictions are trouble and pain,And I hope you will not draw it twice.(2.

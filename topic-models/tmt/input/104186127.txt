and alas • it has proven a snare.We entered both into a promisary oath,To cleave to each other while life did remainI was to marry none but herself alone,Nor was she to nvtrry another man.4( 3 )So w4 did bind ouxselyes with a curse,To fall upon any of us that did break ;And now she has broisen, th*refore I hopeShe will get the burdeniupon her own neck,He that doth her enjoy, good breeding did destroy, Or else he would never endeavoured,No nor caused her to break the promise she did make,Nor her conscience with sm to have burdened.For a heavy burden she doth bearof griveous guilt and black perjury, •/For she tramples upon light, and says that she’s rightWhen, positively, the truth she denies.But I fear I’ll have to stand when both sea and land■Shall all be alter’d into another frame ;To witness against her then, in the sight of all men,I'or denying of the truth and abusing the same.But we will leave her to meditateUpon her former life and conversation;And I heartily wish she may get forgiveness.For every sin and transgression,O my heart is like to sink, and to break when I thinkUpon the flattering words that she spoke ;How she said her heart was glad when I came intoher bed.Or inclosed into her afms in the dark,W hen thus inclos’d into her armsWhat our behaviour was I wih congeal;( * )For the shameing of mysel’ I darna we!! tellWh it as that present time I did fee!—For truly modesty ought to be set on high,Among all young men, and maidens likewiseFor temntions are nor good, nor yet easily withstooWhen they come unto you in a pleasant guise.But O this day ! there’s no man knowsThe grivious torment that I have endur’d ;‘ For my melancholy I think will m.-ke me die,My diseases they will not he easily cur’d !I’ve had many a weary night ay longing for day-lightTormented with many a vexing dream :My eyes they are grown blear’d with weeping for I’rfear’d,That l m driven quite out of all esteem.For among the psetty handsome young maids.Who of my daft behaviour do hear,I’m afraid they will me mock, and cry yonder’greeting Jock,O this will be their talk of me I do fear.But now I’m resolv’d all these fears to disolve,To leave off this weeping and clear up mine eyetSome lassie brisk and kind will fix on me her mU»d;And toward me her affection will rise.But now I do begin to repentThat I myself so far did expose}1 believe I would been wise to have holden my peacepAnd not to kav« made such a pitiful noise :( 5 )■I repent this foolish fit, and for more xvftTo behave more wisely the time that’s to come,Than daftly to lamerit a thing that is mippe t,which indeed is the thing 1 have foolishly done.But let never a man do as I have done,And I pray you to take this counsel of me.To keep yourselves free rill be^ire the j riest you be,Least you be deceived deceitfully.Concerning whom I speak my he .ri is like to break.And has brought me near to my very grave ;Yet I hope [ will recover, to range the world oyer.And never more to be a woman's slave,Altho no mention I have madeWhat is my name, tho’ I be not asham’dTo tell what I am, nor from whence I came,Altho this v.- man I have not nam’dIf my name you want to know the same is still toshow,Altho it is needless the gftme to discloce;My name is moorland Johnny I’m better than I’mbonny,And sometimes I wear some holes in my hose.THE POTATOE MERCHANTMy Father was once a great merchant,As any in Ireland was found,But faith he could ne’er save a shilling,Tho* tatoes he sold by the pound.So. says he to ni’’Another, ong nig'ht,l o.Engianc^uppttse you and I go,Aiwthg very same day, by moonlight,iney took leave of the county of Sligo.Sing de ral, lal deral la, fallal, lealThat the land ail cover’d with water.’ -Tv/ixt England and Ireland, youdl own • ]And single misfortunes, they say,lo Irishmen ne’er come alone ;So my father, poor man !

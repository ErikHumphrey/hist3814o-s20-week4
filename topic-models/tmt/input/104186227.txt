though sad and forsaken,In dreams I revisit thy sea beaten shore,But alas ! in a far foreign land I awaken.And sigh for the friends that can meet me no more.And thou, cruel Fate, wilt thou never replace meIn a mansion of peace, where no peril can chase meAh, never again shall my brothers embrace me ;They died to defend me, or live to deplore.-—3Where now is my cabin-door, so fast by the wildwood ?Sisters and sire did weep for its fall;iWhere is the mother that look’d on my childhood?And where is my bosom-friend, dearer than all ?!Ah, my sad soul, long abandon’d by pleasure,■IWhy did it doat on a fast fading treasure ?Tears, like the rain, may fall without measure,But rapture and beauty they cannot recal.But yet all its fond recollections suppressing,One dying wish my fond bosom shall draw;.Erin, an exile bequeaths thee his blessing,, Land of my forefathers—Erin go Bragh.Buried and cold, when my heart stills its motion,preen be thy fields, sweetest isle in the ocean,knd thy harp-striking bards sing aloud with devo¬tion,’,1 Erin mavoureen, sweet Etin go Bragh.| The Soldier Bridegroom s Song.jHE heath this night must be my bed,:he bracken curtain for my head,jly lullaby the Warder’s tread,t Far, far from love and thee, Mary,o-morrow eve more stilly laid,:’y couch may be my bloody plaid,iy vesper song thy wail sweet maid,It will not waken me, Mary.41 may not, dare not fancy nof.*The grief that clouds thy lovely brow jI dare not think upon thy. vow.And all it promis’d me, "Mary.No fond regret must Norman know.When bursts Clan-Alpine on the foe}His heart must be like bended, how.His foot like; arrow free, Mary.A time will come with feeling fraught,For if I fall in battle fought,Thy hapless lover’s dying thoughtShall be a thought on thee, Mary.And if return’d from conquer’d foes,How blithly will the evening close.How sweet the linnet sing repose,To my young bride and me, Mary,Sweet Complaint!GO where glory waits thee.But while fame elates thee.Oh !

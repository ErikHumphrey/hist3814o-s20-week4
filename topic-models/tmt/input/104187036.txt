Sir, your long lalh’d whip,and give your gig and pair,That I may drive to yonder town,And fiourilh through the fair.The father Ihock his headMy fon,you know not what you ask;To drive a gig in crowded ftreetsis no such eafy task.The horfes full of reft and corn,fcarce I mvfelf can guide.And much I fear if you attempt,lome milchief will betide.Then think, dear boy, of fornetb.ing elieThat’i better worth your wifning ;A bow and quiver, bats and balls,a rod and lines for fiftdng.20But nothing cfould young Jehu pleafe,except a touch at driving ;’Twas all in vain, his father found,to fpend his breath in driving.At last. Attend, rafh boy, he cried,and follow good advice.Or in a ditch both gig and youwill tumble in a trice.Spare, fpaffc the whip, hold hard the reins,the deeds go fad enough ;Keep in the middle beaten track,nor crofs the rut fojrough ;And when within the town you come,be fure with fpecial care.Drive clear of fign-pods, booths and dallsiand mo niters of the fair.•The youth fcarce heard hi* father out,but roar’d bring out the whisky,With joy he view'd the rolling wheels^and prancing ponies frisky.He feiz’d the rems, and up he fprung,and wav'd the whiftling lath ;Take care ! take care ! the father cried,but off he went flab daih.Who’s this light fpark, the horfes thought,we’ll try your ftreisgth young mailer,So o'er the rugged turnpike roaddill fader ran and falter.21Young Jehu tottering in his feat,now wifhed to pull them in ;But pulling from fo young a handthey valued not a pin.A drove of grunting pigs beforefill'd up the narrow way :Dafli through the midft the horfes drove,and made a rueful day ;For fome were trampl'd under foot,feme crufli‘d beneath the wheel,Lord how the driven curled and fwore,and how the pigs did fqueal.A farmer's wife, on old blind Ball,went flowly on the road,With butter, eggs, and eheefe, and creamin two large panniers flow'd.Ere Ball could ftride the rut, amain,the gig came thundering on,Crafh went the panier, and the dameand Ball lay overthrown.Now through the town the mettled peirran rattling o’er the flones,They drove the crowd from fide to fide,and fhook poor Jehu's bones.When lo directly in thecourfea monftrous form appear'd ;A fhaggy bear that ftalk'd and roar d,on under legs uprear'd.*22Sideways they ftarted at the fighV,and whisk'd the gig half round.Then crofs the crowded market platethey flew with furious bound;Firft o’er a heap of crockery ware♦he rapid car they whirl'd;And jugs and mugs, and pots and pa&,in fragments wide were hurl'd.A booth flood near, with tempting cake*and grocery richly fraught jAll Birmingham ot t'other fide,the dazzled optics caught.With active fptimg the nimble fteedsrufh'd through the pafs between,And fcarcely touch’d—the car behindgot through not quite lo clean.For while one wheel one flail engag’d,its fellow took the other.Dire was the clafh, down fell the, booths,and made a dreadful pother.Nuts, oranges, and gingerbreadand figs here roil’d around ;And feiffars, knives, and thimbles, there,beftrew’d the glittering ground.The fall of booths, the fhouts and criesurg'd’an the horfes fafter;And as they flew, at ev'ry ftepthey caus’d fome new difafier.23Here lay overturn'd, ia woeful plight,a pedlar and his pack.There in a fhewman's broken boxall London went to rack.But now the fates decreed to flopthe ruin of the day.And make the gig and driver toe,a heavy reckoning pay.A ditch there lay both broad and deep,whofe dreams were black as ftyx,From ev'ry quarter of the towntheir muddy currents mix.Down to its brink in heedlefs hade,the frantic horfes flew.And in the midft, with fudden jerk,tbeir burden overthrew.The proftrate gig with defperate forcethey foon pull’d out again,And at their heels, in ruin dire,dragg'd lumbering o'er the plain.Here lay a wheel, the axle there,the body ftill remain’d,Till fever’d limb from limb, the carnor name nor lhape retain'd.But Jehu muft not be forgot,left floundering in the flood,With clothes all drench'd and mouth and eyesbeplafter’d o’er with mud.24Jn piteous cafe he waded through,and gained the fllpperjr fide,Where grinning crouds were gathered round. to rao^k h^ ^Hcn pride- ^ ^ -tIhfey kd4iy\*ifb a fieighhMKSng pump,to clear his difmal face,Whence cold and heartlefs home he flupk,involv’d in fore difgrace.And many a bill for damage done.his father had toTpay/\Take warning youthful drivers allfrom Jehu’s firft efiay.>.iSi■* ^

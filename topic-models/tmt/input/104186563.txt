You may judge r>t the foiteof this (hock,when 1 inform you, it was lo violent, that I couldfcarce keep on my knees, but it was attended withfome circumhances dill more dreadful than the for¬mer — On a luddtn 1 heard a geneial outcry ‘ S hefea is coming in, we lhail be alt loft ’—Upon this,turning my eyes towards the river, which in thatplace is near four miles broad, I could percesve itheaving and fvveiling in a moft unaccountable man¬ner, as no wind was dirririg ; in an infbnt there ap¬peared, ai iome imali ddtance, a large body of wa¬ter, riling like a mountain ; it came on foaming androaring and rufhed towaros the ihore with luchimpetuofity, that we all immediately ran for ourlives as fad as poffible ; many were actually fweptawav, and the reft above their wailt in water at agood diltance from the banks For my own part,i had the narrowed tfcape and ihould certainly havebeen led, had 1 not graiped a large beam that layon the ground, till the water returned to its channel,which k did almolt at the fame inftant, with equalrapi ity As there now appeared at lead as muchdanger from the fea as the land, and 1 Icarce knewwhither to retire for fbelter, 1 took a hidden refo-lution of returning back with my cloaihs all drop¬ping, to the area of St. Paul’s : here 1 dood f. me•time, and obferved the fhips tumbling and toffingabout, as in a violent dorm ; fome had broken theircables, and were cairied to the other fide of theTagus , others were whirled round with incrediblefwdtnels j levcral large boats were turned keel up¬wards; and ail this without any wind, which feem-ed the more aft„nidiing. It was at the time ofwhich I am now fpeaking, that the fine new quay,built of rough marble, at an imrnenl'e expence, wasentirely fwaliowed up, with all the people oh it,< **3 )who had fle^ thither for fafety, and bad reafon tothink themfelves out of danger in fuch a place ; atthe fame time a ‘great number of hosts and fmaUvefle!', anchored near it (all likewife full of people,who had retired thither for the f-me purpofr) wereall fwallowed up, as in a whirlpool, and never moreappeared.‘ This laft dreadful incident I did not fee withmy own eyes as it palled three or four ftone throwsfrom the loot where I then was, hut l had the ac¬count as here given from ftveral mailers of fhips,who were anchored withm two or three hundredyards of the quay, and faw the whole rataftrophe.One of them in particular informed me, that whenthe fecond Ihock came on, ha cou’d pc.'ceive thewhole cky waving backwards and forwards like thefea when the wind firft begins to rife *, that the agi¬tation of the earth was fo great even under the ri¬ver, that it threw up his large anchor front themooring, which fwam, as he termed it on the fur-face of the water ; that immediately upon this ex¬traordinary concuffion, the river rofe at once neartwenty ftftt, and in a moment fublided ; at whichInftant he faw the quay, with the whole concourfeof people upon it, link down, and at the fame timeevery one ot the haats and vrffels that were near itwere drawn into the cavity, which he fuppoles in-hantly clofed upon them, hiafmuch as net the leadlien of a wreck was ever feen afterwards. Thisaccount you may give full credit to,, for as to thelo!s of the velTels, it is confirmed by everv body ;and with regard to the quay, * went myfe f a fewdays after to convince myielf of the troth, and:ou'd n t find even therujns'of a pitace, where lhad taken io many agreeabl v-aUc1;, as this v.-a- tha-co iimon rendezvous of tilt f 'cl .ry n the cool of toeev nitig 1 found it all deep w 'e , and in fotnaparts lca»cely to be fathomed1‘ f his is the only pi tcc 1 could learn which wisfwallowed up in or about JLiibon, though I law many( *4 )large cracks an<l /iflares in difFercnf parts, and encodd phenomenon I mu/t not omit, which wjis com¬municated to me by a friend who had a houfe andwine-cellar; on the other ude of the river, viz. thatthe dwetling-houfe being firft terrib y lhak-n, whichmade all the family rUn ont, there prefently felldown a vaft: high rock near it, that upon this theriver rofe and fubfided in the manner already meti-tioned, and immediately a great number of fmallfiflures appeared in feveral contiguous pi-ces ofground, whence there fpouted out like a jet d'eau alarge'quantity of fine white fand, to a prodigiousheight.‘ I had not been long in the area of St. Paul’s,when l felt the third (hock, which though fomc-what lefs lioltnt than the two former, the feaed in again, and retired with the fame rapidity,and I remained up to my knees in water, though Ihad gotten upon a fmall. eminence- at fome didancefrom the river, with the ruins of feveral interveninghoufes to break its force At this time I took no¬tice the waters retired fo impetuoufly, that fomeveflels were left quite dry, which rode in feven fa¬thom water : the river thus continued alternatelyrulhing on and reining feveral times together inInch fort, that it was ju .1/ dreaded L fbon wouldnow meet the fame fa e, which a few years ago hadbefallen the city of Lima.‘ Perhaps you may think the prefent doleful fub-je& here concluded} but,'alas! the liorrors of thelirft of November, are fufficient to fill a volume.As foon as it grew dark, another feene 'prefenteditfelf little lefs ihocking than thofe already deicrib-td—the whole city appe-red in-a blaze, which wasfo bright that I could e.uily fee to read by it.

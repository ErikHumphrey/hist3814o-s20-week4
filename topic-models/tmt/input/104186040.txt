Err noFEMALE POLICY DETECTED,CHAP. IOF THE ALLUREMENTS OF WOMAN.Of all vices, an unlawful freedom with the fe¬male sex is the most predominant, and of all sinshath the most powerful temptations; and manyallurements do betray and draw men into thisfolly. The inducements of the fair sex are soprevailing, a propensity in nature so forcible, itis hard to stand unmoved, when tempted forwardby the charms of a subtle woman, and drove bythe foul desires of an unbounded lust.But as there is no passion too strong to beconquered, or temptation too great to be resisted,so if you will observe the maxims I shall giveyou in this little treatise, you will be armedagainst beauty, make love your subject, and allthe subtleties of the fair sex shall truckle, andbecome instruments of direction, instead of yourruin.Be careful how you conceive too good an opin¬ion of a woman at first sight, for you see not thewoman truly, but her ornaments. Paint, patches,and fine dresses are to hide defects; for beauty,like truth, is always best when plainest.4Many in rich dresi look inviting, whose beau¬ty, when they undress, flies away with their ap¬parel, and leaves you (as Juno did Ixion) nothingbut a cloudy mistress to embrace.If you like a woman, and would discover ifshe be in nature what she may seem by art, sur¬prise her in a morning undressed, and it is ten toone but you will And your goddess hath shiftedoff her divinity, and the angel you so much ad¬mired, turned into a Mall ion.Be always jealous of a maid that extols herown virtue; a wife who exclaims against her ownhusband in his absence, and a widow that courtsyour company; for when a woman praises hervirtue, it is as a shop-keeper does a commodity,desiring to be rid of it; and she that sticks notto lay open the fldlino-s of her husband to an¬other, will to the same man lay open herself,whenever he shall require it of her; and when awidow seems fond of your conversation, be sureit is through design, and if you are not careful,she will bury you alive.Be not tempted to pick up any woman in thestreet; but if you should, be sure you have oneeye before, and another behind; for whosoeverlust leads, danger follows.Covet not the presents of a fond woman, forthey are baits left to ensnare you, and while you9for she that you keep will keep another if she can ;their being the same ambition in her to be themistress of another, as there is in you to be masterof her; and he that thinks a woman constant be¬cause he keeps her, proves a knave to himself,and a fool to his madam.Put not faith in a woman that is wife to anoth¬er ; for she who is not constant to her husbandwill never be so to you.A woman who hath a husband and admits of agallant, let him look upon her as Monsieur Rag¬out’s mistress, who was constant to the wholetroop.A married woman, if lewd, is subtle by experience; for she who hath her husband to deceiveevery day, can deceive a gallant at leisure.A durable love is the supporter of constancy;but that love can never be lasting that stands ona false bottom.Be constant to no woman but a wife; if yoube, you deceive yourself; expect no constancy ina whore, for she will deceive youCredit no woman’s words who hath lost her vir¬tue, but believe the contrary, for she talks coun¬ter.If you have contracted any friendship with awoman, let all she can do for you be no morfithan you deserve; but if she prove constant/ letit be more than you expect.10Think not woman is most faithful to him sheis most fond of; for to him she deceives most sheseems most obliging.Believe not all to be virgins who talk much oftheir virginity; for all would seem maids thathave bee/i otherwise. iTo one a woman may be constant; but if shedivides her affections between two, she can beconstant to neither.If you are familiar with another’s wife, believeher not when she says she knows none but herhusband and you; for she will swear to her hus¬band she knows none but himself.Credit nothing a woman says as to her con¬stancy or virtue ; forshe will justify her innocencebefore him with whom she has been guilty.Love no woman in the absence of her husband,you only stop a gap for another who will returnyou no thanks for your labour, and remember hisapproach will be your distance.If you have a woman, concealed it; oblige herwith courtesies, but show no passion; for by yourprudence you may master her, to whom a discov¬ery of your love will make you become a servant.Measure a woman’s love by her jealousy : forshe loves him best of whom she is most jealous;and of whom she is most jealous, to him she ismost constantBe jealous of a woman that will not be jealousnof you; for she that will not be jealous loves younot; and she that loves you not will not be con¬stant to you.Answer all the expectations of a woman youwould keep ccgstant; for one single neglect haz¬ards the loss of her affections.Keep a watchful eye over the woman whomyou love; seem not to be over credulous of hervirtue; if you do, she will make trials of yourfaith.She who kisses her husband in public, hathgenerally her eye on him she would kiss in pri¬vate ; and she that will kiss both in public andprivate values not where she kisses.Be constant to your wife that she may be con¬stant to you; for gratitude may constrain a wo¬man to preserve those bonds which revenge maymake her violate.Chuse for your wife a prudent woman, forprudence preserves virtue, virtue love, love con¬stancy.Inconstancy in a wife makes wedlock a bram¬ble, which bears abundance of thorns.Inconstancy in a husband makes inconstancyin a wife; and an inconstant wife makes a hus¬band a constant cuckold.Trust no man with your wife abroad, norcourt your friend to bear her company at home12in your absence; for opportunity and importuni¬ty may conquer the most heroic virtue.Carry no man to your mistress if you prizeher; for if she loves you, she will be civil to yourfriend for your sake.It is the policy of a designing woman to obligethe friend of him that loves her. To acquaintherself by that means with his affairs that shemay manage him the better.Most women are of cold constitutions, andunder the dominion of them; and remember itas an approved maxim, that all sublunary thingsare subject to mutation.Constancy is a great virtue, and its oppositeis a dangerous vice; whoever neglects the formerto practise the latter, is neither to be loved nortrusted.It is good to be wise, it is wisdom to be just,and just to be constant.CHAP. III.OF THE LOVE OF WOMEN.The love of woman is easy to be gained, butdifficult to be preserved. You may with moreease subdue virtue, and bring a chaste womanto your embraces, than engage her to be con¬stant.It is a received opinion among their sex thatthe passion of love ceases in a man after enjoy *5think you are a gainer by her gifts, you are los¬ing yourself.Whoever is trepanned by a woman's smiles,is as a fly hampered in a cobweb, which waitsthe leisure of the spider when he shall be de¬voured.He that serves the lust of a woman makes him¬self her monkey, for she admires him no longerthan while he is playing with his tailBe as careful how you lie upon a whore, ashow you keep one : for by the former you willget nothing, and by the latter, lose every thingyou have got.Mistrust a woman that seems rich by her owndiscourse; for she that talks much of her fortunehath generally but little.Think not every woman rich that wears gayapparel, for many forfeit their virtue to maintaintheir prideBuild not too great faith on the sight of a fewguineas or a gold watch; these may be but show¬ing-horns to draw you to your ruinBelieve'no man’s affirmation of a woman’s for¬tune, unless you know him ; for designs are nevercarried on without abettors.Be sure of her portion, though you take hervirtue upon credit; but he that takes both upontrust, may find, when too late, that he hathneither to trust to6Endeavour not to continue a woman’s love by(rifts, for every present you make her may be thepurchase of a rival: besides the love gifts, and ifyou use them to it, they will love you no longerthan while you are giving.Believe not the trivial favours of a woman asa demonstration of her love; for they take prideto be beloved, though it may be by those theyscorn.Raise not an opinion of yourself upon the flat¬teries of a woman, nor think her praises any signof love, but her cunning; for designing women,like great politicians, flatter them they design toruin. Let no woman charm you with the musicof a smooth tongue, for many can talk well thatact ill.Believe no woman the more virtuous for re¬sisting the first attempt; for like besieged towns,they will withstand several efforts, and at lastsurrender upon capitulation.Some women (like strong holds,) are to betaken but one way, which if you cannot readilyattain, he content, she will And ways to direct,you if she likes y u.When a lewd woman serves your necessity, itis with a certain expectancy you should serve herlust. Her kindness is measured by your eapaci-tv, and continuance of her favours dwells uponthe repetition of your performances. She will/.| 7stretch hei* purse-strings to support you in ex¬travagancies, if you strain as much to supply herunbounded lechery; but you may be sure sh{-will be your servant no longer than you remain,her drudge.He that is stallion to a whore, is a slave toiniquity, and a champion to another’s vices, a1 coward in a good cause, and a curse to himself.Let no woman tempt you by her wit to lovei her; for she who hath wit enough to tempt youhath enough to deceive you.I Suffer not yourself to be ensnared by a womanover free in her gestures, or conversation; forwhosoever is most active in behaviour, behavesherself like a lover of much action, and whoso-| ever is free in much company will be freer when| but two together. Think not the amorous glan¬ces of a woman towards you, gives you title toher affection ; for they can look one way whentheir hearts are another.Expect no good quality in a woman more thanwhat she shows; for it is a maxim in their poli-Itics, to put the best side outwards.If you love a woman, be careful how you showit; for your nibbling at the bait may too earlydiscover a willingness to be caughtWaste not your strength in the employmentof beauty, neither your time nor money in cor-I' rupting virtue; but marry a chaste wife of a!  '8good family, with a moderate fortune, and youneed not question being happy.CHAP. II.OF THE INCONSTANCY OF WOMEN.Whosoever resigns her virtue to gratify ano¬ther’s will, will not scruple the same freedomwith another, to pleasure her own; for few wo¬men love so well as to love a gallant better thanthemselves..She who will loss her reputation to oblige you,will hazard your love to gratify herself; and shethat will do both, can never be constant.Put no confidence in a woman that has losther honour; for she who is without reputation,hath nothing to engage her to be faithful.Constancy is maintained by virtue; and shethat hath lost her virtue, hath nothing left tooblige her to be constant.She that prefers pleasure before virtue, willbe constant to her lust, but not to you.Nothing engages a man’s affection so much toa w'oman as belief of her constancy; but it is bet¬ter to believe her otherwise, for then she cannever deceive you; w'omen are sensible that con¬stancy is more prised than beauty: but it is amaxim among their sex, to deceive us most inwhat we most value.Nothing is more ridiculous than to keep a miss17Thus oftentimes they let their own jealousiespass for realities, and sour their affeetions intoa sharp revenge without a just occasion, turningfuries to those they loved, through a fanciful in¬gratitude ; which I conceive to be the chief reasonwhy women are more subject to this passion thani men.Covet therefore no woman’s love, but whomyou will be diligent to oblige; for a small ne¬glect is taken by them as a great ingratitude.Deal with a revengeful woman as with a hand-grenade, which you cast from you as soon as thefuse is lighted, lest it burst to the prejudice of1 him that fired it.Have no familiarity with her you have diso¬bliged, lest, bee-like she stings you with her tail.She who once loved you, and is turned yourenemy, look on her always to be so; be not de¬luded by her flatteries to give it into her powerto hurt you; for women though they seem toforget a wrong they have been forced to suffer,yet you will find they have good memories whenthey have power to revenge it.Trespass not on the affections of a woman wholoves you to excess^ for women (like ale) if oversweet will turn sour the sooner.Take not always a woman’s frov/ns as slights,nor her smiles as a sure argument of her love,for every time the sun is clouded it does notpre-18diet foul weather, and when she shines out astorm may be near at hand. Woman can dissem¬ble their passions, and change their looks as ascorpion can its colour.A woman’s love is like to vinegar, which cannever be reduced to its primitive goodness, butwill always remain sour till it is dead.Nothing is so revengeful as an injured woman ;for which reason the poets have ordered thefuries to be put in the feminine gender.The love of a virtuous woman is a great bles¬sing : but if once lost by ingratitude, you willfind that she will turn her love that could notlast, into a fevenge that will.Shun a woman that is your enemy ; for everytime she sees you it puts her to fresh mischiefs.If you have dealt ungratefully with a woman,converse with none that respect her, lest at sometime or other it should happen to your prejudice,The passions of an envious woman are virulent,and flattery the otdy antidote to expel the poison.To dissemble shows more prudence than to ag¬gravate ; by the one you may pacify the fury offermented spirits, when the other will beget inyour enemy fresh resolutions for mischief.Be merciful to those you can overpower; butflatter such enemies you cannot conquer; for re¬venge (though sweet to those who seek it) is always bitter to the sufferers19Some women are politicly penitent: after a re-( venge completed, they will palliate the injury,| with succeeding pity ; but think the sorrow ofsuch a person as great as hers, who weeping fol¬lows a dead husband to the grave, whom she haswished out of the world a thousand times while| he was living.Changes in inconstant tempers are never to bominded: she who does you a willing injury, andI seems sorry for it, it is your prudence to believethat she only grieves the mischief she has doneyou is no greater. Trust an enemy who hathif once hurt you, upon a reconcilation, no fartherthan you would the fawning of a mastiff dogwhich had attemped to worry you.Most women are polite in their love, but muchmore subtle in their revenge; therefore be care-;; ful how you affront them, or deceive them, toJ deserve it; besides it is ignoble to offend the| peevish, or hurt the weak.Make not her that loves you, by ingratitude,your enemy ; for revenge (like a crab-tree) pro¬duces a sweet blossom, but a sour fruit.CHAP. V.OF THE PRIDE OP WOMENStateliness in a woman may become her as shewalks, but pride in conversation is hateful and. ridiculous, and exposes the person affected withit to the censure of the company, in such awk¬ward gestures, and uncouth behaviours, such pe¬remptory sentences, and impertinent loquacities,that offend the eyes and ears of all that haveeither modesty or prudence. Nothing showsthe want of judgment more than female pride,which is doubtless, nourished by the vain con¬ceits of their own beauty, and begets such a self-love grounded upon self-opinion, that they lookupon their whole sex beside with envy and con¬tempt, and, like Narcissus, daily doat on the re¬flection of their own imaginary excellencies.Cast not your eye too often upon such women,for they are changeable mistresses, implacablewives, and ill mothers to their children.A proud woman, like an imprudent prince,always loves him best by whom she is most flat¬tered.If you aim at the favours of a lofty mistress,you must highly extol her person and parts, andcoincide with her opinion in all things, thoughever so opposite to reason: for flattery and hu¬mility must be the supporters of your interest.Let pride in a fine woman anticipate your ad¬miration ; for never admire her who admires her¬self too much ; conceive her as a large looking-glass cracked, by which single defect it is render¬ed of small value, by reason it can never bemended.13ment, and the esteem he had before of her per¬son, is much lessened by her condescensions tohis desires; which conception occasions her towithdraw her affections from you (unless everyhour you confirm her in a different faith by freshassurances) covetting to be beloved by some¬body who hath a good opinion of her virtues;for there is nothing more certain, than that wo¬men who have been deceived themselves take asecret delight in deceiving others; therefore youthat are the deceivers, be careful you be not de¬ceived.The love of a virgin is innocent and lasting asher virtue. The love of a just wife friendly anddelightful. The love of a lewd woman lustfuland revengeful.If you are the favourate of a lady, and dependupon her courtesies, you must be industrious tooblige her, and as watchful to preserve her fromthe efforts of rivals, or you will soon find yourmistress like a pop-gun, the last pellet she re¬ceives will drive out the former.Sympathise not with a Woman who loves youpassionately; for as she finds your love increases,she will cool her own with the assurance of yours.If you have gained a woman’s love, and wouldpreserve it, be sure be Constantin your visits;for you will find most women have such badmemories, that a week’s absence will make then i’forget you.The love of a woman hath its seasons, likethe year, its spring, summer, autumn and win¬ter. It begins with a warm desire, and is nour~,ished to a greater heat by the kind influence ofithe object, till the harvest of her joys are fullripe; but when the fruits of her affection arereaped and gathered, you will soon perceive somesharp breezes, as signs of an approaching winter.The love of a chaste woman will be continuedtowards you as long as you behave yourself well ;but the love of a woman who hath lost her vir¬tue is but during pleasureLove a woman with moderation, that loves youto an excess; her passion will naturally reduceitself to the same equality, for no extremes arelasting; and then you have the advantage, forthe countenance of a little love shows a constanttemper, and looks friendly and obliging when apassion cooled to the same indifference will lookslighting and neglective. Besides, he that lovesa woman too much, is apt to love himself toolittle.Depend not on the love of a lewd woman, itis a reed will soOn deceive you, her love is en¬tangled with her lust; to continue the one, is tobe a slave to the other, and rather than to bethat, I would share the punishment of Sisiphus.Secure not your love to a woman, by oaths or; protestations; for she will then think you havebound yourself to continue that respect, whichwould be otherwise her care and study to meritand preserve.Let not the protestations of a woman’s love toyou be a precedent to folly, though you love her;! for she does it only to tempt you to give in thesame security, that she may have the more toupbraid you with, whenever you shall prove| false.[: If you are beloved by a person you cannot; marry, whom you are willing to secure to your! own embraces, draw what you can from her in¬sinuations ; the more you get, the faster you bindher; she will not part with that easily, which shehath purchased dearly; and the more you costher, the more she will prize you.The love of a woman is much to be pitied, the! love of a wife highly to be valued, but the love! of a vicious woman deserves neither; for she willove any that will serve her lust.Give fio encouragement to the love of another’s! wife; for it is lustful in the beginning, treacher¬ous all along, and dangerous in the end.Love is a distemper will wade through thegreatest difficulties to obtain a cure; he that isthe physician may expect what fee he pleases;ill1(5therefore do you take care how you become thepatient.Seraphic love is the bliss of angels, mutuallove the comfort of mankind, natural love thechain of the world, but lustful love the motherof misfortune.To love a wife is our duty, to love a friend isour interest, but to love a courtezan is a danger¬ous ventnre.CHAP. IV.OF THE MALICE AND REVENGE OF WOMAN.Of all passions, that of revenge is the mostopposite to reason and good humour: it will sofar blind and deceive the judgment, that per¬sons under this madness value not what injuriesthey do themselves in rashly attempting sometrifling prejudice to an adversary. This passionin woman springs mostly from the envenomedseeds of corrupted love; (as the best wine onceturned becomes the sharpest vinegar) and is sopredominant in this sex, that they value nothingthey do to accomplish those ends in which thesweetness ot their revenge is centered; and asthey love to extremes, every little neglect theyconstrue a great slight, and through their weak¬ness’, mistake accident often for design, and flingthemselves by their own whimsies and conceits,into an evil opinion of person whom they love.21Pride in a witty woman is like a whetstone toI a scythe, it only serves to sharpen her reflections,and makes her a most dangerous weapon for at man to meddle with.A proud woman like a stately horse, is to be! rid with a crub, and managed with the rein, orshe will soon be the bane of the rider.If you marry a haughty woman you ought tohave a good estate, for you will find a proud wife,in a low situation, will be an uncomfortable com-^ panion, and the first in adversity that shall lende a helping hand to your ruin.Pride in a friend is dangerous, in a mistressr. chargeable, but in a wife an intolerable torment.Many women have virtue enough to resist thec bare attempts of familiarity; but few that can|; stand against the powerful charms of gold, fineIjdress, coach and horses, and attendance. It isjgrandeur influences pride, and leads ambition bylithe nose through the worst of vices: for there areimany who are honestly poor by constraint, that/would willingly commit an evil to be rich.Many women have forfeited their virtue toigratify their lust, but more to maintain their prideand lust, though it will make a woman a whore,i yet it is pride makes her mercenary.That virtue is never safe which is under theif■'’Dof pride; the latter will be jnaipiain*22tained, though the former be sacrificed to maintain it.He tnat hath a proud woman to his wife, ilike an oak begirt with ivy: for he suffers himself to be embraced by that which will bring hirto his ruin.When ambition leads the van, the main bod’of vices follow; and wherever you see pride in thfront, be sure lust marches in the rere.Pride in a beautiful woman is like a flaw in ;diamond, it lessens the value, spoils the lustreand remains incurable.He that marries a proud wife is as unhappy aa prince who hath a rebellious nation to governas the letter must grant every petition of the peopie to secure peace in his kingdom, so must tinformer every request of his wife, to preserve tinsame in his family.Of all imperfections in a woman, pride is tinmost intolerable ; for that is the hardest to hiexcused, which is never to be mended.Pride in a wife makes the husband appear littie; it often compels him to submit where he hat!a right to govern.He that hath a prudent wife, hath a gunr&imangel by his side; but he that hath a proud wifehath the devil at his elbow.A proud w oman is an imperious wife, an undutiful daughter, an implacable mistress, a harsh! mother, and a saucy servant.Pride is the parent of iniquity, the inventorof vice, the seed of rebellion, and the rise offaction.Pride lost mankind their paradise, the worldits peace, and made a devil of an angel.CHAP. VI.OF THE INGRATITUDE OF WOMEN.Let no man deceive himself with the expectationof gratitude in a mercenary woman; for she whofor silks or satins, or a splendid maintenance, willsubmit to your pleasure, and swear constancy toI her keeper, shall be the first that forsakes you inI a declining condition ; and though she hath builta provision for herself out of the ruins of yourfortune, yet she shall be the last person that shalllend you the least assistance when your occasionsshall the most require it. Therefore, look uponwhatever you give to such a woman to be buriedas a deep sea, from whence no returns can be ex¬pected.If you love a woman, be not deluded by hertrifling prese'nts to make chargeable returns; forthat is the aim of her policy. Let not a pointcravat, because it is her own working, give hertitle to the settlement out of your estate; lestwhilst your mistress extols your gratitude, theworld laughs at your follyGiving presents to a woman to secure her love,is as vain as endeavouring to fill a seive withwater : for you may continue giving the one, and 1pouring into the other, till the last trumpetsound, ere you find the one faster or the other theThe gratitude of a mercenary woman lies onlyin her tail; with it she dissolves all obligations,and will still be a gainer, even when the debt ispaid.Whosoever blames a woman for her ingrati¬tude, is equally culpable for trusting her with thepower to prove so; for love with moderation keepa close heart, and a wary hand, and her ingrati¬tude can never hurt you.To a woman you love behave yourself boldly,and with freedom, though justly and respectfully,for a manly carriage will awe her to be grateful,when cringing fondness may occasion her to pre¬sume on your good nature.fuller

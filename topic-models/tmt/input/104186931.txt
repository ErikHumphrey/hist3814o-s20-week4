But he-,fore her return King Pepin being a huntingin the foreit, came to the tree where Ihs hadleft the other babe, and caufing it to be taken,up, fent it to a nurfe and wnen it grew up,he called his name Valentine.

IT.Valentine conquers his brother in the Foreftof Orleans.NOW- Valentine was grown a lufly youngman, and by the King as greatly belov¬ed as if he had been his own child ; com¬manding him to be taught the ufe of arms,in which he foon became fo expert, that fewin the court dared to encounter him ; whichmade Hufray and Henry, the King’s baftardfons, exceedingly envy him. At this junftufegreat complaints were made again ft the WildMan, from whom no knight had efcaped withhis life that had encountered him ; whichmade the King promile a thoufand m sTs toany one that ihould bring him dead or alive;which offer none dared to accept ; but Huf¬ray and Henry dtfired King Pepin to fend Va¬lentine, with a view of getting rid-of fo-power-ful a rival in the King’s favour ; but his Ma-jefty feeing their malice, \vas very angry ;telling them, he had rather lof'e the befit ba¬ron in the land.However. Valentine defired leave of hisiMajefty to go to the for eft, refolving either toconquer the Wild man, cr die in the attempt.( 5 )Accordingly, having lurnifhed hirafdf with agood horfe anti arms, he I’et forward on hisjourney, and after hard u a veiling, he arrivedin the I'orefl i in the evening he tied his horfeto a large fpreading oak, and got up into atree himfelf, for his fecurhy, where he reliedfor that night.Next morning he beheld the Wild Mantraverfmg the for ell in fearch of his prey, atlength he came to the tree where Valentine’shorh; food, from whom he pulled many hairs,up in which the horfe kicked him. The WildMan feeling the pain, was going to tear himto pieces, which Valentine feeing, madefigns-as if he would fight him, and accordingly heleaped down and gave him a blow ; but theWild Man caught him by the arm, and threwhim to the giound. Then taking up Valen¬tine’s fhield, he beheld it with amaze, in re-fpett to the colours thereon emblazoned.Valentine being much bruifed, got up, andcame to his brother in great anger ; but Or»fon ran to a tree, and then they engaged ;but both being terribly wounded, gave out byconfent ; after which Valentine fignified toOrfon. that if he would yield to him, hewould order matters fo as he fhould become arational creature.Orion thinking that he meant no harm,ftretched forth his hands to him. Upon whichhe bound him, and then led him to Paris,where he prehnted him to King Pepin, whohad the Wild Man. baptiled by the name ofOrion, from his being taken in a wood. Or-fon’s actions, during his (lay there, very.< 6 )much amufed the whole court, fo that atlength the Duke of Acquitain fent letters, im¬porting, that whofoever fhould overcome theGreen Knight, a fierce Pagan champion,fliould have his daughter Fazon in marriage.Upon which propofition, Valentine fet out forthat province, attended by his brother Orfon,by which means he came to the knowledge ofhis parents, as we fhall find hereafter.CHAP.

Orfon being armed in Valen¬tine’s armour, came to the Green Knight’spaviilion, and defying him, they began theraofi; terrible combat hat ever was hear of,and the Green Knight mace fo great a Itrokeat him, as to cut oft the top of his helmet, andhalt his fhield, wounding him muchBut this ferved only to enrage the ValiantOrion who coming to him on toot, took holdof him and pulling him from his horfe got'aftride him, and was juft going to kill him butwas prevented by 'Valentine who intercededwith Oifon to Ipare his life, on condition ofhis turning Chriftian, and acquainted KingPepin how he was conquered,.The Green Knight having promifed to per¬form all that v/as dtfired, they led him a pri-foner to the city of Acquitain ; and the Dukereceived them with great joy. and offered theLacy Fazon to Orion ; but he would notmarry her, till his brother had won the GreenKnight’s fiftei, Lady Clerimond ; nor till theyhad talked with the enchanted Head of Brafs,,( 8 )t© know his parents, and get the proper ufeof his tongue.Which when the Lady knew {he was veryforrowful, becaufe fhe loved Orfon, and wasrefolved to marry none but him, who had fonobly conquered the Green Knight.CHAP. IV.Valentine and Orfon go in Search of LadyClerimond, who had the Brazen Head inher Pcffeflion.VALENTINE and Orfon having takenleave of the Duke of Acquitain, and hisdaughtei Fazon, proceeded on their journey infearch of the Lady Cltrimond, and at lafl cameto a tower of burnilhed brafs ; which, uponenquiry, they difcovered to be kept by Cleri-mond, fifter to Ferragus and the deceafedGreen Knight, and having demanded entrancewere refufed it by the centinel who guarded thegate y, which provoked Valentine to that de¬gree, that he ran againft him with fuch fury,that the centinel fell down dead immediately.The Lady Clerimond beheld all this difpute,and feeing them brave Knights, received themcourteoufly, Valentine having prefemed tok¬ens from the Green Knight, told her he camethere for the lo+e of her, and to difeourfe withthe All-knowing Head, concerning their pa¬rents. ,After dinner, the Lady Clenmond tookthem by the hand, and led them to th£ cham-( 9 )ber of varieties, where the Head was placed be¬tween four pillars of pure jafper, when as theyentered it; it made the following Ipeech toValentine :t; Thou famous Knight of Royal extradt,art called Valemihe the Valiant, who of rightought to many Lady Clcrimond. Thou artfon to the Emperor of Greece, and the Em-prefs Bellifant; who is now in the caftle of Fer-ragus in Portugal, vhere fne has refided fortwenty >.ears. King Ptpin is thine uncle, andthe Wild Man thy brother j the Emprefs Bel¬lifant brought ye two forth in the fordt of Or¬leans y he was taken away by a ravenous bear,and thou waft taken up by thine uncle Pepin,who brought thee up to man’s eftate.-—More¬over, I imewife t-eli thee, that thy brotherfliall never fpeak, until thou cutteil the threadthat groweth under his tongue.The Brazen Head having ended its fp.eech,Valentine embraced Orfpn, and cut the threadwhich grew under his tongue ; when he di¬rectly related many wonderful things.After which Valentine married the LadyCleriarcnd, but not before fne had turned aChriftian.In this caftle there lived a dwarf, namedPacplet, who \vas an enchanter, and by hisart had contrived a horfe of w ood, and in theforehead a fixed pin, by turning of which, hecould convey himfeif to the fartheft part ofthe world.This enchanter flies to Portugal, and infor¬med Fpragus of hi&fifter’s nuptials, and of herturning Chriftian, which fo enraged him, thate ro )he fvvore by Ma’oomet he would make her rueit, and therefore got ready his fleet, and failedtowards the cjflde of Clerimolid, where, whenlie arrived he concealed, his malfce from hisfilter ; and alio the two Knights, telling them,that he came to bring them into Portugal, thebetter to lolemnize their marriage, and hewould turn Chriftiati on their arrival at hiscall le, all which they believed, and fooh aftercinbarked with him.When he had got them on board, he order¬ed them to be put in irons, which fo muchgrieved his filler Clcrimond, that flie wouldhave thrown herfeif into the fea, had flie notbeen (lopped.C H A P. V.Pacolet comforts the Ladies, and deliversValentine and Orfon out of prifon.WHEN they were come to Portugal, heput Valentine and Orfon into a dun¬geon, and fed them with bread and water,but allowed his lifter Cjerimond the liberty ofthe caltle, where (fee met the Emprefs Bellifantwho had been confined twenty years in thecaflle of Ferragus.She lecing her fo full of grief comforted her,enquiring the reafon, which (he told her.The Emprefs was mightily grieved but Pa¬colet comforted them, telling them he wouldreleafe them ail in the evening, which he ac¬cordingly did in the following- manner ;( H ^In the dead of the night he goes to the dun¬geon, where lay Valentine and Orfon. boundin chains, and touching the doors with his ma¬gical wand, they flew open ; and coming tothe Knights he releafed them, and conductedthem to the apartment where Bellifant andCierimond were, who were exceedingly tranf-ported \ but Pacoiet hindered them from dif-eourfing long, by telling them they mult de¬part before the guards of berragus awaked,which would put a flop to his proceedings.So Pacolet led them out of the callle. and hav¬ing prepared a Ihip he conveyed them to theLady Eazon, at fhe'city of Acquirain. Nextmorning when Feragus heard of their efcape,he was enraged to the high eft degree.The Knights and Ladies being out of dangerfoon arrived in Acquitain to the great joy ofLady Fazon, v,ho was foon after married toOrfon with great folcmnity ; upon which tiltsand tournaments were pe-formed for manydays; but Valentine carried the prise, over¬throwing at lealt an hundred brave Knights-CHAP. VI.Fcrngus raifes a mighty Army, and lays Siegeto the City of Accpritain.FERAGUS, to be revenged on them, afT-embled an army, and laid clofe fiege toit, with a vaft army of Saracens ; vdien DukeSavary perceived it, he refolved to give thembattle the very next morning, and according..( 12 )ly he fallied forth with all his forces, butventuring too far,xhe was taken by the Sa¬racens, and carried to Feragus’s tent.Now Qrfon was refolved to fet him free,or lofe his life ; fo putting on the armour ofa dead Sarafi.n, he called Pacolet, and wentthrough the enemy without being molelted,until they arrived at the tent where the Dukewas confined ; which done, they gave him ahorfe, and rode to the Chrihian army ; ontheir retur* a general {hour was made by allthe army, of Long live the Duke of Acqui-tain! which fo difmayed the Saracens, thatthey fled away in confufion, and the Chrifti-ans purfued them till the nighjt obliged themto give over.Soon after this viftory, Valentine, Orfon,tha Ladifs Bellifant, Clerimond, and Faaon,.fet out for Conflantinople to fee the Emperortheir father, after they had taken leave ofthe Duke of Savary and his nobles, and werereceived with great joy.At length the Emperor fet out from Con-flantincpie, after taking leave of his family,to vilit a flrong caflle he had in Spain.While he was abfent. Brandifer, brotherto Feragus, invaded the empire with a verygreat army, and at length befieged Conftan-tinople where lay Valentine and Orfon, theGreen Knight, and all the ladies.Valentine feeing the condition they all werein, refolved to give Brandifcr battle, and there¬fore divided his army into ten bataliions, com¬manded by ten Knights, and failying out of( 13 )the city, began the fight with the Saracens,.who drew up in readinefs to receive them.In the mean time the Emperor who was atfea, returned homeward, and in his way hemet a fleet going to tin afliftance of Brandifer,which bore down upon him with full fail ;1 whereupon, exhorting his companions to be-1 have like men. they made ready to receiveI, them, and after a mofl:,bloody and obftinate! battle, the Emperor got the victory, havingfflain many of the Pagans, and difperfed theirl (hips.After this victory, the Emperor command-| ed his men to put on the arms of the vanquilh-s ed, as he did himfelf, thinking thereby theI better to fall upon the befiegers his enemies j1 but the ftratagem proved mofl fatal to him,| as we fhall hereafter find.All this while the Chriflians and Valentine; bravely encountered Brandifer, and his men,i; before the walls of Ccnftantinople, fometimesgaining, and fometimeS lofing ground : but' at length Valentine came to the flandard of' Brandifer, where an Indian King ran againffchim with great force, but Valentine avoidinghim, ftruck him with fuch fury, as cleft himdowh’the middle. - ^ :On the other hand. Oifon and the Greenl Knight were not idle, but with their braudifh-ed (words cut themfelves a paflage quite thro*the Pagan army, ddlroying ail that onpofeciIthem.Soon after, news came that a mighty fleetof Saracens were entering the harbour ; uponwhich.

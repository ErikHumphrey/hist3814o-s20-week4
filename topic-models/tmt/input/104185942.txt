I’ve got a charming bride,Through life we both shall sweetly glide;She’s really worth the world beside—Her name is Mrs Johnston.We both agree in every frame,So one another we ll ne’er blame;She's humpy, bandy—I’m the same,O lovely Mrs Johnston.I to a gin-shop go each day,A dozen drops I stow away,And after that I skittle play,And so does Mrs Johnston.I beats the chaps with great delight.And puts the garter out of sight.Then stagger home dead-drunk at night,And so does Mrs Johnston.To free-and-easys I repair.My name is famous every where,l very often take the chair.And so does Mrs Johnston.Do you think I’d pay my penny ?—no;I chaunts the Bay of Biscay, O !And like a Lord tobacco blow.And so does Mrs Johnston.=£?'*7At dancing I am quite a Don,To twopenny hops 1 often run;And I can shuffle too like fun, <rAnd so can Mrs Johnston.At fighting I can take my share,I am a match for any here;A fighting man I am they swear.And so is Mrs Johnston.♦IAmongst the girls I sometimes roam,’Bout which she does not stamp or foam.I often take a lover home,And so does Mrs Johnston.In getting children I’m not shy.For modesty is all my eye ;I've got four young ones on the sly,And so has Mrs Johnston.Bout dress I do not care a jot,Though once of clothes I had a lot.I’ve pawned all but the suit I’ve got.And so has Mrs Johnston.Of trouble I have had some shocks.And ’cause I gave a cove some knocks,I twice have been put in the stocks,And so has Mrs Johnston.Now all who are to wedlock prone.If you its joys would have alone,Select a temper like your own.As I did Mrs Johnston.3For if your ways bring misery,As long as you both agree,You’ll live in fun, and joyful be,Like me and Mrs Johnston.rrW viia •• d 4-. • ow IDO YOU EVER THINK ON ME, fEu?Do you ever think on me, Peg ?Do you ever think on me ;When I'm in the kitchen cookingCalipash and Calipee ?When the pork is on the fire.And the sausage in the pan; .Do you think I can forget, love ?Oh no, I never can.Then do you, &.c.When a.corn is on yrour toe, dear,Which with plaster you are healing,Do you ever think on me, Peg,When potatoes I am peeling?Then do you, ike., . \ r T;; ? -37 >«(•1 ' L ’Oh!

church-book,throughout all the nation.Now let us all kneel down and pray,both now and ever after,And let us ne’er forget the day,King William crofs’d over the water.On July the firft in Old Bridge-town,there was a grievous battle,Where many men lay on the ground,while cannons they did rattle.The Irilh then they vow’d revenge,againft King William’s forces,And folemnly they did proteft," that they would ftop his courfes.In Old Bridge-town, ftrong guards were Iand more at the Boyn-water, (kept,King James began five days too foon,with drums and cannons rattling.He pitch’d his camp, fecur’d his ground,!thinking not to retire,But King William threw his bomballs in,and fet their tents on fire.L J JA bullet from the Irifh came,which graz’d King William’s armsThey thought his Majefty was flain,but he receiv’d no harm*His General in friendfliip came,his King wou’d often caution.To Ihun the fpot where bullets hot,did fly in rapid motion.j| He doefn’t deferve, King William faid,the name of Faith’s Defender,That will not venture life and limb,to make his foes fur render.Now let us all kneel down and pray,both now and ever after,And let us never forget the day,King William crofs’d over Boyn waterThen faid King William to his men,brave boys we are well armed,And if you'll ail couragious be,we’ll venture and take the water :The horfe were ord’red to march on firftand the foot did foon follow after,But brave Duke Schomberg loft his lifeby venturing over the water.Be not difmay’d, King William faid,for the lofs of one commander,For God this day fhall be your King,and I’ll be Gen’ral under.The brave Duke Schomberg being flain,King William he accofted.His warlike men for to march on,and he would march the foremoft.In princely mein the King march’d on,his men foon follow’d after,With fhells and fhot the Irilh fmote,and made a grievous daughter.King James efpy’d the Englifli then,King William he governed,He thought it better for to retreat,than ftand and be difarmed.The Proteftants of Drogheda,have reafon to be thankful,1 hat they were not to bondage brought,altho* they're but a handful.Firft to the Tholfel they were brought,and try’d at Mill Mount-ater,But brave King William let them free,by venturing over the water.Nigh to Dundalk the fubtile French0had taken up their quarters,And on the plain in ambulh lay,a waiting for freih orders;But in the deed time of the night,they fet their tents on fire ;And long before the break of day,to Dublin did retire,King William as our General,no martial e’er was braver,With hat in hand his valiant men,he thank’d for their behaviour.We’ll (heath our fwords and reft a while,in time we’ll follow aftef, (fmile,Thefe words King William fpoke with athat day we crofs’d the water.That pattern day proved too hot,for King James and all his army,He would rather choofe for to retreat,than to ftand and be difarm’d.W e’U give our pray’ers both night and day,both now and ever after.And let ns never forget the day,King James ran from the water.THE VIRGIN’S CHOICE.AS now my bloom comes on a pace,the fwains begin to teaze me ;But two, who claim the foremoft place,try different ways to pleafe me.To judge aright, and chufe the heft,is not fo foon decided ;When both their merits are expreft,I may be lefs divided.Palemon’s flocks unnumber’d ftray,he’s rich beyond all meafure ;Wou*d I but fmile, be kind and gay,he’d give me all his treafure:But then, our years fo difagree—fo much as I remember,It is but May, I’m fure with me,with him it is December.Can I, who fcarcely am in bloom,let frofi: and fnow be fuing ?*Twould fpoil each rip’ning joy to come,bring ev'ry charm to ruin.For drefs and fhow to touch my pride,my little heart is panting ;But then—there’s fomething elfe befide,I icon fliould find was wanting.Then, Colin, thou my heart lhall gain,for thou would ne’er deceive me ;And gray-bair’d wealth (hall plead in vainfor thou haft moft to give me.My fancy paints thee full of charms,thou looks fo young and tender.Love beats his new and fond alarms,to thee I now furrender.Let AMBITION FIREthy MIND.LE T ambition fire' thy mind,thou wert born o’er men to reign.Not to follow fiocks defign’d ;fcorn thy crook, and leave the plain.[ 7 )Crowns I’ll throw beneath thy feet,thou on necks of kings {hall tread ;Joys incircling, joys (hall meet,which way e’er thy fancy lead.Let not fpoils of empire fright;toils of einpire pleafure are tThou (halt only know delight,all the joy, but not the care.Shepherd, if thou’It yield the prize,for the bleflings I bellow,Joyful I’ll afcend the Ikies,happy thou (halt reign below.TARRY WOO.To its own Proper Tune,TARRY woo, tarry woo.Tarry woo is ill to fpin.Card it well, card it well,Card it well ere ye begin.When *ti« carded, rov’d and fpun,Then the wark is haflens done ;But when woven, died, and clean,It may be cleading for a queen.Sing my bonny harmlefs (beep,That feed upon the mountains fteep;Blbating fweetly as they go,Thro* the winter’s froft and fnow;Hart and hind, and fallow deer,No by ha’f fo ufeful are ;Frae kings to him that hands the plow,Are all oblig’d to tarry woo.Up ye fhepherds, dance and fkip.O’er the hills and valleys trip,Sing up the praife of tarry woo,Sing the flocks that bear it too :Harmlefs creatures, without blame,That dead the back and cram the wame,Keeps us warm and hearty fu’;Leefe me on the tarry woo.How happy is a fhepherd’s life !Far frae courts, and free of ftrife,While the gimmers bleat and bae,And the lambkin’s anfwer—Mae !No fuch mufic to his ear,Of thief and fox he has no fear $Sturdy kent and colly too,Well defend the tarry woo.He lives content, and envies none ;Not ev’n a monarch on his throne,Tho’ he the royal fceptre fways,Has not fweeter holy days.Who’d be a king, can ony tell,When a fhepherd lives fo well $Sings fae well, and pays his due,With honeft heart and tarry woo.FINIS.

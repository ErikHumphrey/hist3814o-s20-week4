But be¬fore her return, King Pepin being a hunting in theforest, came to the tree where she had left the otherbabe, and causing it to be taken up, sent it to a nurse;and when it grew up, he called his name V-alentine.Blandiman at length came back, and instead of find¬ing his mistress, found her brother Pepin at the tree,to whom he declared all that had happened, and howhis sister was banished through the false suggestionsof the arch-priest; which when King Pepin heard,lie was greatly enraged against the Lady Bellisant,saying, the Emperor ought to have put her to death.So leaving Blandiman, he returned with his noblesto Paris.The Lady Bellisant having followed the bear to nopurpose, returned to the place where she had left theother babe; but great was her sorrow when Blandi-man said he had seen her brother Pepin, but could,tell nothing of the child; and having comforted herfor the loss of it, they went to the sea-side, tookshipping,.and arrived at the castle of the giant Fera-gus, in Portugal.All this while the bear nourished the infant amongher young ones until at length it grew up a wild hairyman, doing great mischief to all that passed throughthe forest; in which we will leave him, and return tothe arch-priest, who did great mischief, until he wasimpeached by a merchant of having wrongfully ac¬cused the Empress; upon which they fought, aftd themerchant conquering, made the priest confess all histreasons.The Empercr wrote about it to the King of France*and he was hanged.THE HISTORY OF4C H A P. n.Valentine conquers his Brother in the Forest ofOrleans.NOW was Valentine grown a lusty young man,and by the King as greatly beloved as if he hadbeen his own child; commanding him to be taughtthe use of arms, in which he soon became so expert,that few in the court dared to encounter him; whichmade Hufray and Henry, the king’s bastard sons,exceedingly envy him —At this juncture great com¬plaints were made against the Wild Man, from whomno Knight had escaped with his life that had encoun¬tered him; which made the King promise a thousandmerks to any one that should bring him dead or a-live; which oft'er none dared to t xcept; but Hufrayand Henry desired King Pepin to send Valentine,with a view of getting rid of so powerful a rival inthe Kisg’s favour; but his Majesty seeing their ma¬lice, was very angry; telling them, he had ratherlose the best baron in thegland.. However Valentine desired leave of his Majestyto go to the forest, resolving either to conquer the ?Wild Man, or die in the attempt. Accordingly,having furnished himself with a good horse andarms, he set forward on his journey, and after hardtravelling, he arrived in the forest; in the eveninghe tied his horse to a large spreading oak; and gotup into a tree himself, for his security, where herested for that night.Next morning he beheld the Wild Man travers¬ing the forest in search of his prey; at length hecame to the tree where Valentine’s horse stood, fromwhom he pulled many hairs, upon which the horsevalentine and orson.£kickelhim; the Wild Van feeling the pain, was go¬ing to tear him to pieces, which Valentine seeing,made signs as if he would fight him, and accordinglyhe leaped down, and gave him a blow; but the Wild,.Man caught him by the arm, and threw him to theground. Then taking up Valentine’s shield, lie be¬held it with amaze, In respect to the colours thereonemblazoned.Valentine being much bruised, got up, and fameto his brother in great anger; but Orson ran to a tree,and then they engaged; but both being terriblywounded,' gave out by consent; after which Valen¬tine signified to Orson, that if he would yield to him,he would order matters so as he would become a ra¬tional creature.Orson, thinking that he meant no harm, stretchedforth his hands to him- Upon which he bound him,and then led him to Paris, where he presented himto King Pepin, who had the Wild Man baptised bythe name of Orso'n, from his being taken in a wood.Orson’s actions, during their stay there, very muchamused the whole court, so that at length the dukeof Acquitain sent letters, importing, that whoevershould overcome the Green Knight, a fierce Paganchampion, should have his daughter Fazon in mar¬riage. Upon which proposition, Valentine set outfor that province, attended by his brother Ors.on, bywhich means he came to the knowledge of his pa¬rents, as we shall find hereafter.C H A P, III.7 he ’Fight between Orson and the Green Knight.& FTER a long journey, Valentine and Orson ar-rived at Duke SaVary’s palace in Acquitain; andI* THE HIS TORY OF, making known the reasons that thev came there,were presented to Fazon, to whom Valentine thusaddressed himself:( “Sweet creature! King Pepin has sent me hitherwith the bravest Knight in ah his realm, to fight theGreen Knight, who, though he is dumb and naked,is endued with such valour, that r.o Knight underthe sun is able to cope with him.”During this speech, she viewed Orson narrowly,and he her; but supper coming in, interrupted them,and they sat down to eat.Whilst they were in the midst of their feasting,the Green Knight entered, saying. Noble Duke of.Acquitain, hast thou any more Knights to copewith me for thy Daughter? Yes, replied the Duke,I have seventeen, and then shewed them to him.The Green Knight then said to them, Eat yourfill, for to-morrow will be your last.Orson, hearing what he said, was much incensed -against him, and suddenly rising from the table,threw the Green Knight with such force against thewall, as laid him dead for some time; which verymuch pleased the whole company.Next day many Knights went to fight the GreenKnight, but he overcame and slew them all, until atlast Orson being armed in Valentine’s armour, Cameto the Green Knight’s pavillion, and defying him,they began the most desperate combat that ever washeard of, and the Green Knight made so great astroke at him, as to cut off the top of his helmet,and half his shield, wounding him much.But this served only to enrage the valiant Orson,who, coming up to him on foot, took hold of him;and pulling him from h*s horse, got astride of him,and was just going to kill him, but was prevented by7VALENTINE and ORSONValentine, who interceeded with. Orson to'spare hislife, on condition of his turning Christian, and ac¬quainted King Pepin how he was conquered.The Green Knight having promised to performall that was desired, they led him a prisoner to thecity of Acquitain; and the Duke received them withgreat joy, and offered the Lady Fazon to Orson; buthe would not marry her till his brother had won theGreen Knight’s sister, Lady Clerimond; nor till th.eyhad talked with the enchanted Hazd of brass, to knowhis parents, and get the proper use of his tongue.Which when the Lady knew, she was v$ry sor¬rowful, because she loved Orson, and was resolvedto marry no..e but him, who had so nobly conqueredthe Green Knight.C H A P. IV.Valentine and Orson go in search of Lady Cleri-mond, rdio had the Brazen Head in her possession.T7ALENT1NE and Orson having token leave of’ the Duke of Acquitain, and his daughter Fazon,proceeded on their journey in search of the LadvClerimond, and at last came to a tower of burnishedbrass; which, upon enquiry, they discovered to bekept by Clerimond, sister to Feragus and the GreenKnight; and having demanded entrance, were re¬fused it by the centinal who guarded the gate; whichprovoked Valentine to that degree, that he ran againsthim with such fury, that the centinal fell down deadimmediately.The Lady Clerimond beheld all this dispute, and .seeing them brave Knights, received ther.n courte¬ously. Valentine having presented tokens from theGreen Knight, told her he came'there for the love'S THE HISTORY CFof her, end to discourse with the All-knowing Head,concerning their parents.After dinner, the lady Clerhnond took them bythe hand, and led them to the chamber of varieties,where the Head was placed between four pillars ofpure jasper; when, as they entered, it made the fol¬lowing speech to Valentine:“Thou famous Knight of Royal extract, are calledValentine the Valiant, who of right ought to marrythe Lady Clerimond. Thou art son to the Emperorof Greece, and the Empress ffellisant, who is nowin the castle of Feragus in Portugal, where she hasresided for twonty years.

'This enchanter flies to Portugal, and informedPeragv ■ of his sister’s nuptials, and of her turningChristian, v-hicH so enraged him, that he swore byMahomet he would make her rue it> and therefore9VALENTINE and ORSON.got ready his fleet, and sailed towards the castle ofClerimond, where, when he arrived, he concealedhis malice from his sister, and also the two Knights,telling the. , that he came to fetch them into Portu¬gal the better to solemnize their marriage, and hewould turn Christian on their arrival at his castle,all which they believed, and soon after embarkedwith him.When he had got them on board, he orderedthem to be put in irons, which so much grieved hissister Clerimond, that she would have thrown her¬self into the sea, liad sire not been stopped.CHAP.

Hdismayed the Saracens, that they fled away in con¬fusion, and the Christians pursued them till the night,obliged them to give over.Soon after this victory, Valentine, Orson, the La¬dies Bellisant, Clerimond, and Faston, set out forConstantinoplei to see the Emperor their Father, afterthey had leave of Duke Savary and his nobloe, andwere received with great joy.At length the Emperor set out from Constantino-1 pie, after taking leave of his family to visit a strongcastle he had in Spain.While he was absent, Brandifer, brother to Fera-gus, invaded the empire with a very great army, andat length besieged Constantinople, where lay Valen¬tine and Orson, the Green Knight, and all the ladies.Valentine seeing the condition they all were in,resolved to give Brandifer battle, and thereupon di¬vided his army into ten battalions, commanded byten Knights, and sallying out of the city, began thefight with the Saracens, who drew up in readinessto receive them.In the mean time the Emperor, who was at sea,returned homeward, and iu his way he met a fleet,going to the assistance of Brandifer, which bore uponhim with full sails; whereupon exhorting his com¬panions to behave like men, they made ready lo re¬ceive them, and after a most bloody and obstinatebattle, the Emperor got the victory, having slain,many of the Pagans, and dispersed their ships.After this victory, the Emperor commanded hismen to putpn the arms of the vanquished, as he didhimself, thinking thereby the better to fall upon thebesieg-rs his enemies; but the stratagem proved mostfatal to him, as we shall hereafter find.All this while the Christians and Valentine bravely12THE HISTORY OFencountered Brandifer and his men, before the wallsof Constantinr pie, sometimes getting, ami sometimeslosing ground: but at length Valentine came to thestandard of lirandifer, where an Indian King ran a-grunst him with great totce, but Valentine avoidingbun, struck him with such fury as cleft him downthe middle"On the other hand, Orson and the Greer, Knightwe ' not idle, but with tbeir brandished swords cutthem elves a passage quite through the Pagan army,destmviny all that opposed them. •Soon after, news came that a mighty fleet of Sa¬racens were entering the harbour* whereupon Va¬lentine judged it was necessary to go thither, andoppose their landing, but it proved fatal* tor in thisfleet was the Emperor his father, who being clad inthe Sara en’s armour, Valentine by mistake ran himquite through the body with his spear; which whenhe- knew, he was going to kill himself, had not hisbrother & the Green Knight prevented him; but get¬ting a horse with an intent to lose his me, he rushedinto tue midst of the enemy, till he came to the Gi¬ant Brandifer, who, when he saw Valentine, encoun¬tered him so fiercely, that both fell to the ground;but Valentine recovering, gave him a stab, whichsent him to hell, to see his false prophet Mahomet.The Pagans seeing their Kmgde«d, threw downtheir arms and ran, and the Christians pursued themwith a mighty laughter.

But Cierimond never would es¬pouse any one, but betook herself to a single life,always lamenting the loss of her beloved husband. ’After his death, Orson governed the Empire withgreat wisdom ani justice for seven years, till at lengthseeing the fragile state of human aifairs, lie gave thecharge of his empire, wife, .and children, to the Green14THE HISTORY OF THEKnight, and then turning hermit, he became oncemore a voluntary resident of the forest and woods,where, after living to a great age, til's magn-inimousand invincible hero surrendered up his body untonever sparing death, and his soul to the immortalDeities, of whose attributes it had a true resemblance.THE HISTORYOF THECOURTIER AND TINKER.C K A P.

This was punctually observed. TheTinker being thus laid, slent s ;uncl!y till evening;when rouiing up between sleeping and waking, andbeing dry, as drunkards usually re, he began to callfor some drink; but was. greatly frighted to find him¬self in such a palace, furnished with lights and at¬tendants about him, that bowed to him, and harmon¬ious music, accompanied with most charming voices,but none of them to be seen. Whereupon, mokingfor his old ciofhes and budget, he found a muff andand rich attire glistering with gold by him, whichmade him fancy biatself metamorphosed from aTinker to a Prince. He asked many questions, butin vain, yet being willing to rise, the attendants ar»rayed him in the richest attire; so then he lookedon all sides, admiring the sudden change of fortune,and as proud as a peacock, when he spreads his tailagainst the glittering beams of the sun. \nd beingarrayed, they had him into another room, where wasa costly banquet prepared, and placed him in a chair,under a fine canopy,'fringed with gold, being at¬tended with wine in gilded cups. At first he strainedcourtesy, but being intreated to sit dowrl, the banquetbeing solely at his disposal, he fell to most heartily.Then after supper they ply’d him with so much wine,as to make him dead drunk, then stripped him, andput on his old clothes; they carried him as they hadbrought him, and laid him in the same posture theyfound him, being ail this time asleep; and when lieawoke, he took all that had happened before for avision, telling it wherever he came, that he hadreally and verily dreamed he had been a prince, tell¬ing them as well as he could all that had happened,but plainly he saw now again his fortune would raisehim no higher than to mend old kettles; yet he made16 THE HISTORY OF THEthe following song for the fraternity to sing at theirleizure :All vou that jovial Tinkers are,Come listen unto me:I dream’d a dream that was so rare,That none to it I can compare,No Tinker such did see.T thought I .was a King indeed.Attired gay and fine;In a stately palace I did tread,Was to a princely banquet ted,And had good cheer of wine.But soon I found tne in a ditch,That did no comfert lend;This shews a I'inlcer. though he itchTo be a Prince, or to grow rich,Must still old kettles mend.CHAP.

How muchmore then wilt thou do behind my ba.ck? But 1 willbe so revenged on thee that whenever any one seesa woman scratching of her breech, they shall cry,‘Butter wiil be cheap;’” (and from thence indeed,that saying came) and so throwing Ler down, in spiteof all her pleading, that it was a pity good buttershould be spoiled, her resisting and entreaties wereallin vain; for turning up her clouts, he so bedaubedher buttocks and thighs, and called his hounds tolick it off; while the poor woman cried ou. lament¬ably, expecting every moment she should be devour¬ed in the bellies of these loud-mouthed voraciouscurs; but he, suffered them not to hurt her, onlysending her away with a greasy pair of buttocks,which she fell to rubbing immediately, as also doubt¬ing, lest there had been some collops taken out ofthem.cm a p. in. ,T//c Courtier's Trick upon the Tinker, for com¬plaining that he could get no drink at his house.THE ['inker I have before mentioned, not know¬ing the house where he had been so nobly en¬tertained, and which he onlv took for a vision, andoften walking that road and crying old brass to mend,had been called in to work, and was often asked var-13THE HISTORY OF THEious questions by the servants, and as often told themhis imaginary vision; but they giving him no strongliquor, he often complained of it ia the town, saying,Thouyh some had praised Sir John’s liberality, andhow free he was of his liquor, j’et for his own partihe could say no such thing, as having'ever foundhim s,o stingy and niggardly, that not so much as onesup of his fam’d March or October beer could he get.This being babbled' about, came to the Courtier’s ears,who was resolved to punish his sauciness, though ina comical way: So one day as he was passing by, heordered him to be called in to do some work; andafter he had done it, to come to him (as having laidall the scheme with his servants beforehand.) Comeold fellow, said he, you look as if you were as dryas Vulcan. What say you, if I should order ycuwhere you may have your full of good drink? Wouldnot you be glad of it? Ay, Master, said he, makinga nod and a scrape, God’s blessing on your heart forit, and I thank you too.Upcn this, he ordered his butler to have him down,and be sure not to stint him, but let him have hisfull swill: They instantly went, and the Tinker fol¬lowed them very joyfully; but they had no soonergotten him down, but shutting to the door close,they ordered him to strip immediately; at the whichhe much wondered, and began to make excuses onaccount of the blackness cf his hide, which would bevery undecent and unseemly. But they pretendedit was th» way of the cellar, when a new comer wasto be maije free of it, but never after, how oft soeverhe came. He being willing to comply, that he mighthave his skin full of good liquor, that might proveboth as meat and cloth to him; ofF went Ins leatherndoublet, breeches, shoes, stqckings, and hat; as for19COiraFiER AND TINKER.;hirt he JvjcI none, having pawnetl it to his hostessthat morning for three noggins of brandy.

So he dipped over head andears like a duck that dives Yet after he had recoveredhis legs, it was but just shoulder deep, for when up¬on winding of the horn; whiht he would have beenscrambling out, down came Sir John, demandingwhat was the matter. They told him, “ The Tinkerwas not content to drink full horns at the cock, hutwould needs get in to diink all at a draught.”—<l Aye,” said he, “ this is a thirsty soul indeed; butsince he undertakes to drink it, he shall do it, fornone of my servants shall drink it now, he has washedhis dirty hide in it;” crying to him with an angryvoice, “Sirrah, you rogue, drink it as you proposed,or it shall'be worse for you;” and while he stoodshivering up to his neck, and was endeavouring tolay the blame upon others, the Courtier se %uad im¬patient to be dallied with, drew a broad sword thatwas two-edged, protesting his head should go off forabusing his good liquor, was there no more Tinkersin the world, and with that, making a full blow athim, as the Tinker believed, ami seeing him in sucha passion, he to avoid the coining stroke, droppeddown over head and ears, staying under as long ashe could, and peeping up, and seeing the threaten¬ing danger, he dropt down again for six or seventimes. ’Till fearing to carry the jest too far, he gavehim a short respite, telling him, ^ Now he couldnot report abroad he was so very niggardly of hisdrink, for he had or might have ensugh of it.”—Then bidding his servants to take him out, and order20 -THE HISTORY OF THEhim (o depart, or drink it up, which he thought fit;And thus he went away laughing The Pinker, whcwas at first very angry, but being chtered up with scordial dram, and so made sensible that all this wasbut a frclick, and that for the future, their masterwould be his good friend if he behaved civilly, fitsw,s pacified, and so putting on his clothes, he beatthe road for a gang of merry fellows of his acquain¬tance, informing them, there was a hogshead cfMarch beer at Sir John’s, which they all might be-partakers of if they chused; they came joyfully, andhad it brought into the court-yard, in blackjacks —*After they had drunk it, the linker to'd them thecause of its being given away, was because there wasa swine that bad unexpectedly fallen into it; but onfurther enquiry he told them all the circumstances,which set them a laughing till their sides were almostcrackt. Afterwards they had plenty of victuals sentthem, and the Tinker being thus made free of thecellar, was ordered to call at the house, and havevictuals «nd drink as often as he came that way.—And so they departed, spreading the fame of SirJohn in every place they came, as a bountiful bene¬factor: singing as they went, the following song:Good house-keeping, they say, is fled,Or hawks or hounds, and whores have rid her;But we say she’s not fled nor dead,Who have so plentiful beheld her.Long may he flourish in this nation,And get it praised as of o'd;That we by following the French fashion,May not make charity grow cold.21COURTIER AND, TINKER..C H A'P.

He had seen an oldcurmudgeon farmer* sleeping and nodding on hishorse, as he came from market, and giving theTinker directions what to do, when he should comeby, knowing his hour, and delivering him a parcelof crackers and other fire-works, he caused him to bedressed in a raw hide with horns, when the I inker,according to order, with the help of a servant, hav¬ing stopped the farmes’s horse, while the rider wassleeping, pitched four stakes, one at each corner ofthe pannel, aud ungirting, he drew the horse fromunder, when taking off the bridle, he put his ownhead into the headstai, so then after he placed thefireworks under the pannel, he put a fuze lighted tothem, and so kept motion as the horse used to dowith the nodding farmer, who having the reins abouthis wrist, by his kicking he awaked, and seeing him¬self on a frightful beast, which he took for Beelze¬bub, Te cried out, when the fire-work taking, blewup btm and the pannei, and made him to fall quashto the ground, so that the l inker made off with thestakes and pannel. The old man no sooner got up5but be fell to running, crying out “ The Devil, theDevil,” and never durst come that way again but incompany, rather chusihg to go five miles about.22THE HISTORY OF THEC H A’P.

Upon this he ordered someclothes to be brought, which the Tinker stripping,put on, and the Knight put on his, except his shirt,and taking his budget, pike-staff, kettle, and ham-*mer, away he went, beating his kettle, and crying,Wprk for a Tinker, till he came near the butcher’shotise. The dog soon heard the link, tink, sud awayhe runs open mouthed to meet the Tinker, theylaughing to see how he would fright him; but SirJohn having now thrown down his budget, was readyto receive him with the pike end of the staff, andafter the deg wheeled, he returned and advancedeagerly to fly at his throat, but he thrust the pikeof his staff into his breast; upon which he ran awayhowling, and tracing the ground with his blood, tillCOURTIER AND TINKER. 23he came to his master’s, where he died: at this, hewas so much enraged, that he carried a constable,and seized the Knight, who purposely made no re¬sistance: Sc taking him before a Justice, he madevery great complaints against him.The Justice very gravely demanded, what the fel¬low was brought before him for? The butcher said,‘ An’t please your Worship, for killing my servant.’‘ Aye, said the Justice, he looks like a bloody-mindedj villain, therefore write his mittimus, and see he bewell ironed, lest he make his escape.’I beseech your good Worship not to be so fashand hasty, said the Knight, as to pass sentence uponme so hard. Pray ask this butcher what servant ofhis I killed ? Ay, said the Justice, let him speak.“ Then in truth,” said the Butcher, “ I ought inconscience to speak the truth; it was but a dog, butsuch a dog, as I say l would not have taken the bestfive guineas in the country for. Do you see me, Sir,he had rare qualities over other dogs; he would notonly fetch home my sheep out of the field, when Iwanted them, and save me that trouble, but do yousee, Mr. Justice, he would go a sheep-hunting, anddrive me home a couple, and sometimes half a dozenof wild sheep, which no body owned, or I did notthink fit to enquire after, or they after me; so thathe made me a thriving man; besides he was the safe¬guard^ my house; and I believe, that he killed himon purpose that he might rob me.”“ Ay, ay,” said the Justice; “ all this is true, andyou speak like an honest man, and he looks indeedlike a rogue, and I believe you; but however we can’tindeed hang him for a dog; but I’ll send him to jail,and there he shall lie and rot in his lousy linen, anddrink kennel-water, and not one bit of meat, unless24 THE HISTORY OF, &ernow and then a roasted turnip, cooled on a burdockleaf?’ ‘ This is a very hard sentence indeed, Mr.'Justice,” said our counterfeit Tinker. “ No, no,’'replied the Justice, “it is too mild a one, for sucha villain as you are.” But, added, “ I had like tohave forgot a material point in his examination. Tellme, sirrah, how you came to. kill this honest man’sdog?” “ Why, Sir,” said he, “ with the pike end.of my staff, for running at me to bite me ” “ Aye,aye,” said the Justice, “ that was villainous in you;could you not have turned the other end, and givenhim a rap upon the pate?” “ Yes,’’ replied he, “ ifhe had come to me with his tail foremost.”* Priihee, shew me, said the Justice, how he cameat thee?”—“ I will shew your worship; he came openmouthed, as 1 do to you now, < rying, Bow, wow,wow.” And here running against the Justice, over¬threw him in.his chair to the ground; so that he mostloudly cried out Murder! anu being got up, he or¬dered his ipittimus to be made, reviling him at a des¬perate rate But all on a sudden the tables wereturned; for no sooner being asked, but he told hisname. W hen up starts the Justice, and coming un¬to him with b low reverence, “ Oh! Sir John,” saidhe, “ Is it you! who could have ever have thoughtit! I am heartily sorry for what I have said.” Thenturning to the butcher who stood wondering, said,-Sirrah, you rascal, do you keep dogs to assault gen¬tlemen? but I will teach you better manners; comebind him over to the sessions directly, and if lie basno bail, take him to jail. This is a pretty thing in¬deed, that people cannot pass the road peaceably forsuch rogues as you keeping dogs.” But Sir Johninterposing, all was pacitkd, and the butcher wenthome with a flea in.his ear.FINIS.

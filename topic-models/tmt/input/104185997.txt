eonld ne’er save a shilling,Though tatpes he sold by the pound.So says he to my mptber one night,To England suppose you and I go 5And thp very next day by rnponHghtThey took leave of the county Sligo.Sing, fal de ral lal de ral la fal la de, &c.That the land is all covered with water,’Twixt England and Ireland you’ll own,And single misfortunes, they say.To an Irishman ne’er canie alone :So my father, poor man, was first drowned,Then ^hipwroek’-d in sailing from Cork;But my mother the got safe to land,And ft wbhky shop opened in York.Sing, fal de ral, &c.Just a year after father was dead.One night about five in the morn,An odd accident happen’d to me,For ’twas then that myself was first bom:4All this I’vo been told by my mammy,And surely she'll not tell a wrong ;But I don’t remember nought of it,Gaze it happen’d when I were quite young.Sing, fal do ral, &c.On the very same day the next year,For so ran the story of mother,The same accident happened again,But not to toe, then, that were brother.So ’twas settled by old Father Luke,Who dissolv’d all our family sins.As we both were born on the same day.That we sartainly must have been twins.Sing, fal de ral, &c.’Twas agreed I should not go to school.As learning I never should want;Nor would they e’en teach me to read.For my genius, they said, it would cramp.Now this genius of mine where it lay.Do but listen a while and you’ll hear:—’Twas in drawing—not landscapes and pictures.No! mine were for drawing of beer.Sing, fal de ral, Ac.Some with only one genius are blest,But I it appears had got two ;For when I had drawn off some beer.I’d a genius for drinking it too.At last 1 was drawn up to town.Without in my pocket a farden;5But since I’ve earned many a crown,By the shop here in sweet Common garden.Sing, fal do ral, &c.Now the end of my song’s drawing near,I’ll tell ye, but that’s nothing new ;Now all my ambition’s to try,And do what I can to draw you ;In which, if I do but succeed,And my efforts beguile you of pain ;I entreat you’ll not wait to be asked,To come often and see me again.THE IRISH SMUGGLER.1 From Brighton two Paddies walked under the cliff,For pebbles ariH. shells to explore,f When too a small barrel was dropt from a skiff,Which floated at length to the shore ;2 Says Dermont to Pat, we the owner will bilk,To-night we’ll be merry and frisk),1 know it as well as my own mother’s milk,Dear joy, 'tis a barrel of whisky.Says Pat, PR soon broach it, a fortunate lot,Now PattVou must know was no joker ;111 go to Ton) Murphy, who lives in the cot,And borrow his kitchen hot poker.T "’‘'■3 said and ’twas’ done, the barrel was bor'd,No bachanals ever felt prouder,6• vtk. *cn Paddj-found out a small error on boardsThe whisky, alas ! was gunpowder.With sudden explosion he flew o’er the ocean*And high in air sported a leg ;Yet instinct prevails, when philosophy fails.So he kept a tight hold of the keg.But Dermont bawled out with a terrible shout,I m not to be choused,

;An’ he sang sae sweet, that the hale o’ pur menLap aff their looms the carle to see.Ilis cap was red, an’ his breeks were green,Fiddledum, faddledum, fee, fee, fee ;An’ his jacket the shortest that ever was seen,An’ the queerest colour you ever did see.Ilis nose was as flat as the back o’ my han’,Fiddledum, faddledum, fee, fee, fee ;An* his feet wad hae covered an acre o’ Ian*,Yet his Boots cam’ up o’er the lid o’ his knee.His e’en were grey without ony white,Fiddledum, faddledum., fee, fee, fee ;An’ his teeth were as black as the middle o’ night,When the moon has forsaken this conn trip.His legs were as bow’d as the half o’ a hoop,Fiddledllhi, faddiedum, fee, fee, fee;An’ his arms were sae lang, he ne'er needit to stoop,For he picked up preens without bending his knae.He laughed, and the hale o’ the men o’ our toun,Fiddledum, faddiedum, fee, fee, fee ;Lap out o’ their wits and fell down in a swoon,The fieut o’ them had the power to fiep,He sang, and they sprang to their feet in a crack,Fiddledipn, faddledurn, fee, fee, fee ;Now what I relate is a notable fact,For I was sleeping when 1 did it sec.■ r /it'He play’d them a jig, and the dancing began,Fiddledum, faddlsdupi, fee, fee, fee;And bo led them to where a big water down ran,Where he douked them till they were like to die.This queer wee man lap up on a hil},Fiddledum, faddiedum, fee, fee, fee;An’ he open’d his mouth like the doer q’ a mill,I hope sic a npmth l yyill ne’er again spp,But thunder no’pr gied fdc a, tprriblp roqr,Fiddledum, faddiedum, feq, fep, lee ;As when he announced that the dancing was o'er,An’

DOOR.There dwalt a man on Crawford moor,And John Blunt was his name ;He made gude maut, and brew’d gude ale,And bore a wond’rous fame.Now it fell upon a Martinmas time.And a gay time it was than.That Johnie’s wife had puddings to make.And she boil’d them in the pan.The wind swept cauld frae north to south.And blew into the floor ;Quoth our gudeman to our gudewife,Get up and bar the door.My hand is in my husewife-cap,Gudeman as ye may see ;If its no barr’d this hunder year,It’s no be barr’d by me.They made a paction ’tween them twa,A paction firm and sure,Whoever spoke the foremost word.Should rise and bar the door.Twa travellers had tint their gate,As o’er the hills they foor.9And airted by the line o’ light,Made straight to Johnnie’s door.Now whether is thi* a rich man’s house.Or whether is it a poor ?But ne’er a word wad ane o’ them speak,For the barring of the door.And first they ate the white puddings.And syne they ate the black:0 muckle thought our gudewife to hersel.But ne’er a word she spake.The young ane to the auld ane said,Here, man, take ye my knife,And gang and shave the gudeman’s beard.While I kiss the gudewife.But there’s nae water in the house,And what shall I do than ?—What ails ye at the pudding broo.That’s simmering in the pan ?0, up then started our gudeman,An angry man was he—Will ye kiss my wife afore my face,And scaud me wi’ pudding breo,An’ up an’ started our gudewife,Gae throe skips o’er the floor,Gudeman, ye’ve spoke the foremost word.Get up and bar the doorLOGAN WATER.0 Logan, sweetly didst,thou glide,That llay I was niy Willie’s bride!And

them all.For his bride a soldier sought her,And a winning tongue had he ;Oh the banks of Allan water.None so gay as she.On the banks of Allan water,When brown autumn spreads his store,There I saw the miller’s daughter;But she smiled no more.For the summer grief had brought her,Aiid her soldier false was he sOn the hanks of Allan water,None so sad as she.On the hanks of Allan water,When the winter snow fell fast,Still was seen the miller’s daughter,Chilling blew the blast.But the Iniller’s lovely daughter,Beth front cold and care was free—On the banks of Allan water,'there a corse lay she.THE

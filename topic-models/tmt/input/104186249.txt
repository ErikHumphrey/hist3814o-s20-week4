May,Off Boston Bay we lay,We sent a challenge tp thp Chesapeake,To engage us in the bay.Our commander of the Shannon,Gallant Brooks was his name,Chear up your hearts my seamen bold,For now she’s bearing down.And on the first of June, my boys,The weather being clear,Bold Lawrence, he soon hove in sight.As plainly you shall hear,And in the space of twenty.one minutes*The action hot begun,And after two or three broadsides,Foul of yard and yard we came.Being broadside to broadside,Our cannons loud did roar.While ninety-five seamen and marines,Lay bleeding in their gore.Which causes many a widowx In Scotia for to mourn,And many desolate mothers,Lamenting the first of June.aFor the space of fifteen minutes,This action it did hold.All on the briny ocean,Men never fought more bold.The Americans we must confessThey did their valour shew,Buc, the remainder of our ship’s company.Soon brought their colours low,Great rejoicings were made in Boston,Their bells did loudly ring,Expecting our commander and crew,Prisoners to be brought in.But unto their misfortune,We soon did let them know,That the Chesapeake to the Shannon,Her colours had laid low.THE FOURTEEN TH OF APRIL.ON the fourteenth day of April,As you might hear them say,Our goodly ship was launch’d,Upon that very day.Bound for the stormy ocean,Where thundering cannons roar,We left our parents weeping,All on our native shore., Like lions bold undauntedWe bore away to sea,Nothing we could espy, brave boys,Till early the next day ;6About the hour of ten o’clock,A Danish ship we spied,Stand to your guns my hearts of oak,Our noble captain cried.Each man unto his quartersSo quickly did repair,We knocked down our cabins,And sweep our decks quite clear,Then we engaged that privateer,Till once she bore awav,That’s bravely done our captain cried,For sooji we’ll make them stav.When our bold captain foundThe enemy’s ship was gone,We crowded all our sail, brave boys,And after her did run :So closely we bore after her.Till early the next day,When a lofty bold French Privateer,Come hearing down that way.She hailed us in French, my boys,And boldly bid us stand,Saying, Where is your country ?Where doth your ship belong ?But the answer we returned them,It was a quick reply,If you are our foe, we’ll let you know,We are true British boys.But when this bold French Privateer,Found we were British bovs,7She hoisted up her colours,And at us she let fly ;Then broadside for broadside,Where thundering cannons roar,And we sunk this bold French pmateer,All on our native shore, a.; -i a :dA.11 in that gallant action, 'i tOur captain he^was slain, 'Likewise our second maet, ' o yd ido:And twenty of our men. ^ .While the rest our bold seamen,Thcv Tvere. bedeck’d'in bloodyBut like bold Alexander,Through fire and smoke we stood.But now the battle’s over,And fit for sea no more.For the loss of legs and aims,We poor seamen now doth mourn.No benefit we have,From the mercy of the waves,But still true British seamen,\V e doth our -country save.FLY NOT YET.FLY not yet, ’tis just the hourWhen pleasure, like the midnight flowerThat scorns the eye of vulgar light,Begins to bloom for sons of night.Ami maids who love the moon!1 ’Twas but to bless these hours of shadej That beauty and the moon were made;a8’Tis then th/ir soft attractions glowingSet the tides and goblets flowing.Oh ! stay,—oh ! stay,—Joy so seldom weaves a chainLike this to-night, that* oh ! ’tis painTo break its links so soon.Fly not yet; the fount that play’dIn times of old thro’ Ammon’s shade,Tho’ icy cold by day it ran.Yet still, like souls of mirth, beganTo burn when night was near :And thus should woman’s heart and looksAt noon be cold as winter-brooks,Nor kindle till the night, returning,Brings their genial hour for burning.Oh ! stay,—oh ! stay,—When did morning ever break,And find such beaming eyes awakeAs those that sparkle here !FINIS.t v ;

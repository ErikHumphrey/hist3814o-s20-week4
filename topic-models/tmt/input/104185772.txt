Andthis sort of trading is now generally in use in ourforeign plantations, to supply the want of mon¬ey. But in process of time, as trading increased,so did luxury begin to abound ; and as luxury a-bounded, so men’s wants grew greater, whichbegat a necessity of some other way of commerce,and this was money ; which is of such antiquity,that Josephus tells us, that Cain, (the son ofAdam, and the first born of men) was very greedyin gathering money together, though of whatmetal that money was made, and whether it wascoined or not he is silent.Herodotus writeth that the first that coined4silver and gold, to buy and sell with, were theLydians. For silver and gold being the mostprecious of metals, were so much valued, thatwhatever any man wanted, might be purchasedfor it.Homer indeed tells us. that before the siege ofTroy, men used to change or barter one commo¬dity for another. But it is undeniable that mon¬ey was in use long before that time; for whenAbraham purchased the field of Machpelah, andthe field in which it was, for a burying place forhis family, he gave four hundred shekels of sil¬ver for it: which the secret texts tells us wascurrent money with the merchant; and that wasabout the year of the world 2088, which wasnear 700 years before the destruction of Troy.But though the money was current with the mer¬chant, yet I question whether it was coined ornot; for it rather appears, that it received its valuefrom its weight than from any stamp, that wasupon it: the weight of an shekel being a quar¬ter of an ounce, and the true value of that 15pence of our money. Abraham paid £25 Eng¬lish money, for that burying place.We read likewise of pieces of silver, or silver-lings, before this, wThich was current money a-mong the nation at that day ; for Abimelech, kingof Gerar, having taking Abraham’s wife from him,upon a supposition that she was his sister whenhe came ,to understand the truth of the matter,not only restored bis wife to him again, but alsogave him a thousand piecesL0.f sil ver or silverlings;the value of which .thousand pieces (each piecebeing worth 2s 6d) came to £125-10s. which atthat day was a noble present ibr a king .to give.But besides shekels and silverliags, there weretalents also, the weight of which was 75 ounces.A talentof silver contained the vaiueof£l87. 10s.Of each of these coins .there is frequent mentionin the Holy Scriptures of the Old Testament.In the New Testament, Our Saviour .command¬ed Peter to take up the fish that first came tohand, and when he had opened its mouth heshould find therein a pie.ce of money, which hewas to take and give the tax-gatherers for hisMaster and himself: which piece of money wascalled a Stator, which consisted,of half an ounceof silver, the value of which was 2 shillings.And when the.Jcws came to ensnare our Saviour,about the lawfulness of paying tribute to Ctesar,he desired them to shew the tribute-money, andJthey shew'ed him a penny, of value 7d-halfpenny ;and that this money was coined and stamped,appears by our Saviour’s asking them, whose im¬age and superscription was upon it? to whichthey answered, Csesar.(5But I need not quote Scripture to prove thatthe Jews and Romans used to coin money, theimage and superscription giving a value to it, andpromoting the currency of it; for silver was coinedin Rome, in the year of the world 3G72, whichwas about 300 years before the Christian sera.History tells us that silver was first of all coin¬ed in the Isle Engina and that in Rome it wasstamped with the impression of a chariot and hor¬ses. And Janus caused brass to be coined witha face on the one side, and a ship on the other,in memory of Saturnus, who arrived there in aship. Servius Tullius, a king of the Romans,first coined brass with the image of a sheep andan ox. And in some places leather cut into pie¬ces has had the stamp of authority put upon it,and so it was made to pass for money. And inNew England, the Indians have money w’hichthey call Wampompege, which is of two sorts,one white, which they make of the stem or stockof the periwinkle, which they call Meteaubockt,w hen all the shell is broken off; and of this sortsix of their small beads, (which they make w ithholes to string the bracelets) are current with theEnglish for a penny. The other sort is blackinclining to blue, which is made of the shell of afish, which they call Pequanhock; and of thissort three make an English penny. They w’holive upon the sea-side generally make of ir, andas many make as will, none being denied tiie li¬berty of making it. This coin of money the In¬dians set such a value upon, that they bring downall sorts of furs which they take in the country,and sell to the Indians and English too, for thisIndian money ; and the currency of it amongthem, makes them look on it as a good equival¬ent for what commodites they have to sell.Both the English, Dutch, and French tradeingto the Indians with it, above six hundred milesnorth and south from England; which is suffi¬cient to shew, that the use of money is v.ery an¬cient, and is made use of by all nations in trade¬ing with each other; and was first invented asa medium in trade, and an equivalent to all sortsof commodities.U JU iUOTHi jn .The Misery of those that want Money and arein Debt.'There is no wise man that will covet moneyfor itself, but for the use that is to be made ofit; for money itself cannot satisfy ; and so we aretold by the wisest of men, Eccles. v. 10. He thatloveth silver shall not be satisfied with silver;nor he that loveth abundance with increase.’' In a time of famine, or in a besieged citv, a manmay have money enough by him, and yet maywant a piece of bread. Money therefore is prizednot for itself but for its use; because, as ‘SoLo-mon also says, “ Money answers all things.’"And seeing without money a man can have no¬thing, they must be very miserable that are with¬out it.Charity, in this last and iron age of the world,is grown so cold, that there is scarce any thingto be got upon that account. If you are cold,charity will not warm you; neither, if you arehungry will it fill your belly ; but if you havemoney, you may do both.If you have money, you may become one ofthe Livery-men of London, an Assistant, a War¬den, or a Master of a Company : but if you wantmoney, you will never arrive to the honour of abeadle; for even for such an inferior employmentyou must make friends, and that cannot be donewithout bribes, nor can you bribe without money.If you have money, you may be an honest .man,and a good man ; but if you want money, youmust be a knave by consequence.Enquire of a rich man among his neighbourswhat he is, meaning only whether he be a sub¬stantial man, and one that is responsible; and,they will presently tell you, “ he’s a very goodman I’ll assure you though at the same time,9with respect to his morals, he is as profligate afellow as any in the whole parish, and one thatlives by oppressing his neighbours, and doing allmanner of injustice; his money making amendsfor all his enormities.I knew a certain tradesman in London, thathad an uncle, a rich covetous fellow, that wasworth many a thousand ; this poor man addressedhimself to his uncle, to give him a £.100 to sethim up ; but he knew the worth of money betterthan to part with it, before death forced it fromhim, and told him plainly, he would give him no¬thing while he lived, but it might be he wouldleave him something, w hen he died, especially ifhe found him industrious, and that he put him¬self in a way to live. The poor man had but lihtie money, and less credit, and how to put him¬self in a way to live he knew not; his trade beingnone of the best for journeymen. However pick¬ing up a little credit at one place, and & little atanother, he addressed himself to the company hewas free of and would fain have borrowed £50of them; but truly they would not lend it him,but upon such security as he could not procure;in this extremity having put himself into a shop,he goes again to his uncle, to desire him to lendhim a little money, telling him he had set up intrade, and was got into a shop, but wanted mon-10ey to carry on iiis business, and desired him tolend him a little. His uncle finding he was get¬ting into a way, out of his generosity lends him£20 ; but makes him give him a bond to pay himin a year’s time. The poor man had almost aswell been without his money, as to have been un¬der such an obligation; but he was resolved tokeep touch with him, though he lived so poorlyall the while that he was the scorn of all hisneighbours and fellow tradesmen, who looked up¬on him as a poor and consequently a pitiful fellow:but for all that he paid his uncle the £20 withinthe time limited; which his uncle took so well,that he told him, since he took such care tokeep his word, he would remember him anothertime. And so he did ; for having neither wifenor child, when he died, he divided his estate a-mongst his relations, and left this poor kinsmanof his, thirty thousand pounds in ready money,and £1500 per annum. And now this poor man,whose poverty made him the scorn of his neigh¬bours and acquaintances before, became a verygood man all on a sudden, insomuch that thecitv took notice of him, and chose him sheriff thevery next year; and the company that before re¬fused to lend him £50, now chose him theirmaster, and were all his humble servants; and hewas applauded and cried un by every one. Here11was now a mighty change, and yet the man wasthe same still; it was money only made thedifference. Judge therefore whether want ofmoney be not an extraordinary misery, and agreat unhappiness.This puts me in mind of a story, I have heardrelated of Jocelin Percy, Esqr., brother to theEarl of Northumberland, who going by a but¬cher’s shop, near Cow-Cross affronted his dog,who thereupon fell a-barking at him, and theEsquire drew his sword and run him through.The butcher, who was troubled for the loss ofhis dog, charged a constable with the Esquire,who carried him before a Justice that knew himnot; the Justice asked him w'hy he killed thebutcher’s dog ? The Esquire answered him verycarelessly, because the dog ran at him. Ran at• you ! says Mr. Justice. How did he run at you ?To which Percy ( being a comical sort of a man )replied, He ran at me thus, Bough! wough!wough! and therewith taking a little run at theJustice, threw him and his chair down together!Which Mr. Justice looked upon as such affrontto his worship, that nothing would atore for, butcommitting him to Newgate, aggravating thecrime of killing the butcher’s dog, telling him,his dog w as his servant, and that for ought heknew7, himself or some of his gang, designed to12rob his ship; but he woulcbmake an example ofhim. Percy seemed very little concerned atwhat the Justice said; which provoked him themore; and therefore he called the clerk to makehis mittimus;, who asking” him what his1 namewas, he said Jocelin. What besides Jocelin?said the Clerk, Percy, said he. Of what place?replied the Clerk. Of Northumberland-house,near to- Charing-Cross, said he. The Justicehearing this and knowing there was a very com¬ical gentleman of that name, who was brother tothe Earl of* Northumberland, then a great favour¬ite with his Majesty,- changed his tone at once,and asked-him if he Was brother to the Earl ? Onbeing answered in the affirmative, he addressedhimself to the butcher in an angry tone,- tellinghim that he would examine into-the affair, andthat he would learn him better than let his dogloose to molest gentlemen as they walked the'street,- and that he would have him bound'overto the peace at the Quarter-Sessions for his futurebehaviour. Which he would have done, and per¬haps more, had not Percy interfered in his behalf.At this alteration the poor butcher was terrified.The Justice then addressed himself to the Es-quirer and begged his pardon for using him insuch a manner, imputing it to his- not knowinghis quality. The Esquire, with a smile, replied13that he must also beg his pardon for throwingihim and his chair over. The Justice answered,there was no offence.Thus we may see the misery of wanting mon-ey. The butcher could certainly have punishedPercy for killing his dog in such an unprovokedmanner, and would have obtained it, had not theJustice discovered Percy’s family, and let Jus¬tice wink rather than offend the brother of a fav¬ourite of his Majesty’s. The poor butcher mustnot only content himself with the loss of his dog,but be glad he escaped so well. It is just so,generally speaking, in every state of life; if aman be ever so virtuous and of the best princi¬ples, if he wants that principle, money, he wantsevery thing, and is looked upon as a mean piti¬ful fellow : on the contrary, if a man be possessedof that, he has every thing, though otherwise ofthe most consummate ignorance, debauched life,and insignificant conversation.I confess, if we look backward into the betterand wiser ages- of the world, virtue,, thoughcloathed in rags, was more esteemed than thetrappings of the gold ass; it is in these last andworst of days that vice has got such an ascen¬dant in the world, as to make men think all thatare poor are miserable; for in the primitivetimes, poverty was the badge of religion and14piety; and weil it might, for not many greatnor many noble were called; and the study awisdom, and contempt of the world was then itesteem among the wisest philosophers in tinearliest ages. But as Ovid, saysThe times are chang’d, and even weSeem changed with times to be.So that in those times, considering the misenof wanting money is so great, we may say witlthe wise man, “ My son, it is better to die thanto be poor which saying was perhaps the occasion of an old miser’s mistake, who bid his soiobserve what Solomon said, “ Always keep ipenny in your pocket.” But his son answere#again, he did not remember that Solomon sai«any such thing. The miser replied, then Solomon was not so wise as Ttook him to be.Indeed money’s now become the worldly man’god, and the card which the devil turns ujtrumph to win the game; for it gives birthlbreeding, beauty, honour, and credit; and makejthe possessors think themselves wise, thougwtheir very thinking so, declares them fools. Buibecause money answers all things, and is in sue*vogue with the world, therefore many are s«willing to purchase it though with the loss osoul and body.But the want of money does not only caus*Iien to be condemned and ridiculed, but it alsoaits men upon taking wicked and unlawfulourses to obtain it: which made one say.O wretched poverty ! a tool thou’rt made,To every evil act and wicked trade,i^or it wresteth and maketh crooked the best na-ures; which are forced by their necessities, tolo those things which they blush to think ofrhile they are doing them; such as borrowing,ind not being able to pay, to speak untruths to:over and disguise their poverty; to deceive andometimes to cheat their nearest relations; andill because, when they are in want, they arecorned, and despised, and perhaps disowned byhem.But before I leave this subject, of shewing thenisery of wanting money, it is necessary I should.ay something of the misery of borrowing money,>r running in debt, which is a consequent of.vanting money ; for he that does not want, has10 occasion to borrow, and is in that respectrappy ; for being out of debt he is out of danger,md therefore needs not seek for by-ways to avoid;iis creditors, but can walk in the open streetswithout fear, and whet his knife even at the gates)f the prison.But on the contrary, he that borrows money,aas made himself such a slave to his creditors,16that he dares hardly say his head is his own, a:is afraid that every one he meet is a serjeanta bailiff, that intends to captivate his outwa^tabernacle; like the man that in the night-timihaving his coat catched by a nail, and so stoped, he presently cried out, “ At whose suitSupposing it was a serjeant that had arrested hirThe causes of Men wanting Money.Since money is a thing so necessary and suseful; and the w'antofa competency of it, makea man so very miseiable, rendering him liable tall the scorn and contempt that an ill-natureworld can throw upon him; it seems strange smany should want it, especially those that knovthe worth of it. And therefore it may be wort)our enquiring into the causes from whence tinwant proceeds: I mean the common and ordinary causes; for there are some causes that artextraordinary, such as all our wit and prudencican neither foresee nor avoid. Such was thaextraordinary and surprising storm in Novembe1703; whereby many thousands were undone, a:to their estates, besides the many lives that wenlost; and such also was the dreadful fire in Lon-17£0don, whereby some that had great estates theone week, had scarce bread to eat the next: andin -the time of war many are unavoidably losers.But these must not be reckoned the commonand ordinary ways that make.and keep men poor.We know indeed, that by the divine providence,in the body of a common-wealth there must be'both poor and rich, even as an human body can¬not subsist without hands and feet to labour, andwralk about to provide for the other members: sothe rich being the holly, which devour all, yet dono part of the work ; but the cause of every man’sI poverty is not one and the same,; some are poorby condition and content with their calling, andneither seek nor can work themselves into bettercondition; yet God raised up, as by a miracle,the children and posterity of these, oftentimes,to possess the most eminent places either inChurch or common-wealth, as to become Arch¬bishops, Bishops, Judges, Commanders-generalin the field, Secretaries of State, Statesmen, andthe like;; so that it proveth not always true whichthe poet says,If poor thou art, then poor thou shalt remain;Rich men alone do now rich gifts.obtain.Of this condition are the greatest number in. everykingdom ; others there are, who have possessedgreat estates, but these estates have not thriven18or continued, being gotten by oppression, deceitusury, and the like, which commonly lasteth notto the third generation, according to the poet,It seldom is the grandchild’s lot,To be the heir of goods not justly got.Others come to want and misery, by spendingtheir fair estates in ways of vicious living, as ondrink and women; for Bacchus and Venus are in-seperable companions; and he that is familiarwith the one, is never a stranger to the other. ,;In same way, manner, and end,Both wine and women do offend.Some again live in perpetual want, being natu¬rally wholly given to idleness. These are thedrones of a common-wealth, who deserve not tolive. “ He that laboureth not, should not eat.Labour night and day, rather than be burthen-some,” saith the Apostle Paul: both country andcity swarm w ith this kind of people; “ The dili¬gent hand,” saith Solomon, “ shall make rich;but the sluggard shall have a scarcity of bread.”I remember when I wTas in the Low Countries,there w’ere three soldiers, a Dutch-man, a Scot,and an Englishman, who, for their misdemeanors,were condemned to be hanged; yet their liveswere begged by three several men, one a brick¬layer, that he might help him to make bricks, andcarry them to the walls; the other was a brewerP Delft, who begged Ills man to fetch watov, ando other work in the brew-house! and the thirdy a gardener, to help him to work in and dresshop garden. The first two accepted their offersrankfully ; but the last, the Englishman, told hislaster in plain terms, his friends had never broughtim up to gather hops : and therefore desired rath-r to be hanged.Others have had great estates left unto themy their friends, and who never knew the painnd care of getting them, have as one said truly,alloped through them in a very short time;oese are such as Solomon speaketh of “ who hav-ig riches have no hearts, or rather the wit, tose them.” These men are most aptly compareda the willow-tree, because the palms of the wil-)w-tree are no sooner ripe, but blown away withke wind.I remember to have heard of a wealthy citizenf London, in Queen Elizabeth’s time, who leftis son a great sum of money, who imagined hehould never be able to spend it ; would usuallylake ducks and drakes in the Thames with shil-ings, as boys were wont to do with tile sheardsnd oyster shells; and at the end came to suchxtreme want, that he was under the necessity>f borrowing sixpence, having many times more20shoes than feet, and sometimes more feet thashoes, as the beggar said in the comedy.Many also there are, who having been born t:a good estate, have quite undone themselves b>marriage, and that after a twofold manner j firstby matching themselves without advice of parentor friends, in heat of youth, unto proud, foolishand light women, that one would better live osmall allowance at a distance, than have a fumeal at home, where he is always troubled wither never ceasing tongue. And this is the reasoso many husbands travel beyond seasor at. homgo from town to town, or from tavern to ■taverr.to look for company ! and in a word, to spend an:thing, to live any where, save at home, in theiown houses, where they are sure to hear nothin:but the brawlings of a scolding woman.DIRECTIONSHow persons may supply themselves with Monejat all times,NOW, if you would ask me what course yotshould take, or what you should do that wantetlmoney .; let him first bethink himself .to what profession or trade he hath been formerly broughup to.

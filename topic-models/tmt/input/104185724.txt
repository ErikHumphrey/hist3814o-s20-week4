SONGS.THE ROSE OF ALLANDALE.The mom was fair, the skies was clear,No breath came o’er the sea,When Mary left her Highland cot,And wander’d forth with me.Tho’ flowers deck’d the mountain side,And fragrance fill’d thp vale ;—By far the sweetest flower there,Was the rose of Allandale.Where’er I wander’d east or west;Though fate began to low’r—A solace still was she to me,In sorrow’s lonely hour.When tempest’s lash’d our gallant bark,And rent her shiv’ring sail—One maidert form withstood the storm,’Twas the rose of Allandale.Aud when my fever’d lips were parch’d.On Afric's burning sand,She whisper’d hopes of happiness,And tales of distant land.My life had been a wilderness,Unbliss’d by fortune’s gale—Had fate not link’d my lot to her’*,The Rose of Allandale.4HEAVING THE LEAD.For England, when, with fav’riug^gale,Our gallant ship up channel steer’d,And scudding under easy sail,The high blue westren l^nd-appear’d, .To heave the lead the seaiharfAnd to the pilot cheerly sung,“ By the deep—Nine !”But bearing up to gain tTfa pdi t,Some well-known object, kept in view—•An abbey-tow’r, an harbour- foit,Or beicon, to' thd .vessel: ttuo ;While oft the lead the seaman flung,And to the. pitot cheerly sung,“ By the mark—Sfsyjys ?’And as the nn:chr!ov'd shore wo ntiftr,.

say not that freedom defend our green shore,O tell not our sons that fair plenty was smiling,Ah ! freedom and plenty, alas ! are no more.We,ask not ior mercy from tyrants so cruel,Our rights we demand, and our rights we shall have:We still shall inherit the blood of our fathers,Who fell at famed Marathon,—their country to save.O hush’d be the trumpet that wakes the war-lion,Fair Peace we adore thee with olive so green.But say, shall brave millions ay bow to oppression,And weep out existence- in sorrow and pain.No—mark the brave sons of the land' ofrColumbia,Their broad spreading fair freedom unfolds.Their rich glowing vallies are sounding with gladness ;And each toiling peasant sweet plenty beholds.O come, ye Spartans ! tho’ dreary the prospect,Come, for our children demand no delay ;Arouse ! or our country will fall into ruins,And grim-eyed oppression will hail the dark day.Then rally, ye Grecians—thy chiefs, O famed Luctra!Still gaze on our sons, though enwrapt with a chain ;Arouse ! from thy fetters, fair land of the sages,And boast not of famous Lucargus in vain.FINIS.CONTENTThe Rose of Allandale,Hearing the Lead,Hearts of Oak,The Lass o’ Govvrre,Farewell to Aberfoyh-,My Dear Highland Laddie, (The Flower ©’'■Duinblane,Donald o’ Dundee,The Highland Laddife,Smile again my Bonny Lassie,The Sea,Sleeping Maggie, - • - ■I Gaed a waefu’ Gate Yestremf,The Minut^ Gun,'Ihe Swiss Boy,Hey the Bonny Breast Kotes, 'Up in the hfejfehg'^EarTy,The Boatie Rows,''i’he Harper of Hiifll,Marry for Lfive and W/irk ft)r.Siller,The Lass of Atrhhteenfe, -Hunting Chorus, -The Rose of Lucerne, ' - -With an Honest Auld Friend,Banners of Blue, - - /My Qwn Bine Bell,The Bay of Biscay, O, -A famous Man was Robin HoOd,Tile Highland Minstrel Boy,Canadian Boat Song, ♦Tlia Grecian’s Song,

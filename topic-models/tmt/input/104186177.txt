Sally Roy.The vi ^ia train in tears are seen,When yellow midnight fi!A the valley,5iow stealing o’er the dew^ green,I Towards the grave of gentle Sally !nd while remenabrance tvfkes the sigh, ®Which weens each feeling heart from joy,be mourning dirge, ascending high,Bewails the fate of Sally Koy.COME UNDER MY PL AID Y.COME under my p’aidy, the night’s gaun to fa’;i>me in frae the cauld blast, the drift, and thesnaw;l»me under my plaidy, and lie down beside me,:ere’s room in’t, dear lassie, believe rrae for twa.>me under my plaidy, and lie down beside me,l hap ye frae ev'ry cauld blast that wbl blaw;come under any plaidy, and lie down beside me,aere’s room in’t, dear lassie, believe m“ for twa.”Jae wa’ wi’ your plaidy, auld Donald gae wa’ iear aa’ the cauld blast, the drift, nor the snaw ;«e wa’ wi’ your plaldy, I’ll fto lie beside ye ;t might be my gutchard; auld Donald, gae wa’.a gaun to meet Johnny, he’s young and he’sbonny,t’s been at Meg’s bridal fou trig and fou braw:Itbere’s nane dances lightly, sae gracefu’, sacj tightly,ji cheeks are like roses, his brow’s like the sna^,’♦ Dear Marion, let that flee stick fast to theYour Jocks bur a.gouk, uid has ae'h.n -• ava|The hale o’ his pack he has mrv on ii- Wack ‘;rfHe’s taretty, and I’m but threescore and tw«i !Be frank now and kindly i I’ll busk you ay fin»ljAt kirk or at market they’ll nane £ang sae brawA bien house to bide in, a chaise for to ride in,And flunkies to ’tend'you as fast as ye ca\”Mv father a) tell’d me my mither and a’,Y e’d make a goad Husband and keep rue ay bravIt’s true 1 !o e Johnny, he’s^ude and he’s bonaBut waes me I km he has naeth.ng ava !I ha’e little tocher ; you’ve made a gude offer:I’m now mair than twenty ; my time is but sma (Sae gi’e me your plaidy ; I’ll creep in beside ye, jiI thought ye’d been aulder than threescore and tw *i tShe crap in ayont him beside the stane wa’,Where Johni.y was list’niug, and heard her tell t 1The day was appointed, his proud heart it dunteAnd struck ’gainst his side, as if bursting iu twHe wander’d hame weary, the night it was drearAnd ihawless he tint his gate deep ’mang t!snaw.The howler was screaming, while Johnny crre* Women♦Wad marry the devil, wad he keep them brav iO the deil’s in the lasses ! sae fond to gang braw iThey’ll lie down vvi’ auld men o’ fourscore an’ tv.^0 1hale o’ this marriage is gowd and a sarriage ;'I love is the cauidest blast n»w that can blaw.iotards be wary, tak tent wha ye marry;oimg wives in their coaches will whip and willtHihey meet wi’ i Johnny, that’s youthfu’ and^ ^bonny,he’ll g ’e ye horns on ilk haffit to claw.THE SOLDIER’S DREAM.!. bugles had sung, fbr the night cloud hadlower’d,jAnd the sentinel stars set the watch in the sky,id thousands had sunk on the ground overpowr’dIfbweary to sleep, and the woinded, to die.hen reposing that night on my pallet of straw,I wolf-scaring faggot, and guarded theslain,the dead of the ni^ht a sweet on I s-aw,id twice ere the cock crew. 1 it again.el bought fiom the battle-field’s dreadful array,| far I had roam’d on a desolate track,1 put lire and sunshine disclos’d the s weet way^the hou-.e of my father, that welcom’d meI back.few to the pleasant fields, travdl’d so oft’ 'e s morning mar«h, wii«n rny bosom wasyoung,I beard my own mountain-goats bleatirAnd well knew the strain that the corn-rsung.Then pledg’d we the wine-cup, and fond^tswo:e, .From my home and my weeping friends Jpto part;My little ones kiss’d me a hundred Coes t'erAna my wife sobb’d aloud in the fuh.heart.Stay, shy with us ! rest! thou art wearyworn.And fain was the war-broken soldier to sfcayBut sorrow return’d with the dawning of ‘TnoTJAnd the voice in my dreaming earaway.A WORD TO THE WISE.II Love yon, by heaven, what can I eay more fThen set not u.y passion a-cooling;If you yield n<*r at once T must e’en give thee o&iFor 1 am hut a novice at foolingWhat my love wants in words, it shall ma|fc hiin deeds,Then why r-hould we waste time m stuff, ch«l<A performance, you know well, a promise e*eee<Amiga .word to the wire is enough, chile. ft n r« .

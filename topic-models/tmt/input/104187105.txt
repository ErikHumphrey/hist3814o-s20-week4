'THE MAID OF ARUNDEL.Thou fairest of the fairest maids,In Arundel’s embowering shades,When beauty smiles in all her charms,And love’s delighted bosom warms,With thee I woo each sylvan scene.Of fragi’ant bower and arbour green,While smiling hope our care dispels,We bless the shades of Arundel.When twilight steals along the world,And wandering shepherds leave the fold,To -woo the bower, the scented grove,And sigh upon the lips of love ;Again my lovely Rosalie,With bounding heart I fly to thee,Love’s dear and fond delights to tellAmid the shades of Arundel.As wandering by tbe castle mound,Or moving in the festive round,I feel the power of love divine,Bright beaming in these eyes of thine.And sweeter is thine artless tale,Than midnight song of nightingale,Soft dying on the breezy swellThat fan the shades of Arundel.JOCKEY TO THE FAIR.’Twas on the morn of sweet May-day,When Nature painted all things gay.Taught birds to sing, and lambs to play,And gild the meadows fair ;Young Jockey early on the mornArose, and tript it o’er the lawn.For Jenny vow’d away to runWith Jockey to the Fair ;For Jenny vow’d away to runWith Jockey to the Fair.The cheerful parish hells had rung,With eager steps he trudg’d along,While garlands round him hungWhich shepherds us’d to wear :lie tapt the window, “ Haste my deai , ^Jenny impatient cried, “ Who’s there V“ ’Tis I, my love, and no one near,Step gently down, you’ve nought to fear,With Jockey to the Fair ;Step gently down, &c.G“ My dad aud mammy’s fast asleep,My brother’s up and with the sheep,And will you still your promise keepWhich I have heard you swear ?And will you ever constant prove ?“ I will, by all the powers above,And ne’er deceive my charming dove :Dispel those doubts, and haste my love,With Jockey to the FairDispel those doubts, &c.“ Behold the ring,” the shepherd cried,“ Will Jenny be my charming bride ?Let Cupid be our happy guide.And Hymen meet us there.”Then Jockey did his vows renew,He would be constant, would be true,His word was pledg’d, away she flewWith Jockey to the Fair ;O’er cowslips tript, &c.In raptures meet the joyful train.Their gay companions, blithe and young,Each join the dance, each join the throng,To hail the happy pair ;In turns there’s none so fond as they,They bless the kind propitious day,The smiling morn of blooming May,When lovely Jenny ran awayWith Jockey to the Fair ;When lovely Jenny, &c.7FAIREST OF THE FAIR.0 Nannie, wilt tliou gang wi' me,Nor sigh to leave the haunting-town ;Can silent glens have charms for thee.The lowly cot, and russet gown ?Nae langer drest in silk and sheen,Nae langer deck’d wi’ jewels rare,Say, canst thou quit each courtly scene,Where thou wert fairest of the fair i0 Nannie, when thou’rt far away.Wilt thou not cast a look behind ?Say, canst thou face the parching ray.Nor shrink before the wintry wind?0 can that saft and gentlest mienSeverest hardships learn to bear,Nor sad, regret each courtly scene.Where thou wert fairest of the fair ?0 Nannie, canst thou love so true,Thro’ perils keen wi’ me to gae?Or when thy swain mishap shall rue,To share with him the pang of wae.And when invading pains befal,Wilt thou assume the nurse’s care.Nor wishful those gay scenes recal,Where thou wert fairest of the fair ?And when at last thy love shall die,Wilt thou receive his parting breath?Wilt thou repress each struggling sigh.And cheer with smiles the bed of death8And wilt thou o’er his rauch-lov’d clajStrew flowers, and drop the tender tear ;Nor then regret those scenes so gay.Where thou wert fairest of the fair ?FAREWELL, FAREWELL.Farewell, farewell, dear Erin’s Isle!My native land, adieu !I’ve seen thy hours of sunshine smile.And mark’d thy sorrows too.The pale moon trembles on the deep,But ere the morning dawn,The winds will only hear me weepFor thee, my Peggy Bawn.And though I haste beyond the sea.Where sweeter scenes may smile,My heart unchang’d will turn to thee,My own, my native isle.But now a long, a kind farewell,To mountain, grove, and lawn,While tears alone my parting tell,From thee, my Peggy Bawn.

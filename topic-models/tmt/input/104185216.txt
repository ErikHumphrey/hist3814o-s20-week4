Campbell.YOUNG LOCHINVAR.)h, young Lochinvar is come out of the west,uhrough all the wide border his steed was the best,Und save his good broad-sword he weapon had none,le rode all unarm’d, and he rode all alone,o faithful in love, and so dauntless in war,here never was knight like the young Lochinvar,ifle staid not for brake, and he stopp’d not for stone,le swam the Esk river where ford there was none—5ut, ere he alighted at Netherby gate,The bride had consented, the gallant came late;8For a laggard in love, and a dastard in war,Was to wed the fair Ellen of brave Lochinvar,So boldly he entered the Netherby hall,'Mong bride's men, and kinsmen, and brothersand allThen spoke the bride’s father, his hand on his sword.For the poor craven bridegroom said never a word,“ Oh, come ye in peace here, or come ye in war.Or to dance at our bridal ? young Lord Lochinvar.”“ I long woo'd your daughter, my suit you denied:Love swells like the Solway, but ebbs like its tide ;And now I am come with this lost love of mine.To lead but one measure, drink one cup of wine.There be maidens in Scotland, more lovely by far.That would gladly be bride to the young Lochinvar.The bride kiss’d the goblet, the knight took it up.He quaff’d off the wine, and he threw down the cup !She look’d down to blush, and she look’d up to sigh ;With a smile on her lips, and a tear in her eye.He took her soft hand ere her mother could bar,—“Now tread we a measure!” said young LordLochinvar.So stately his form, and so lovely her face.That never a hall such a galliard did grace !While her mother did fret, and her father did fume.And the bridegroom stood dangling his bonnet andplume,And the bride-maidens whisper’d, “’Twere betleiby far,To have match’d our fair cousin with young Lochiavar! *fl,lo.Uij9One touch to her hand, and one word in her ear.When they leach’d the hall door and the chargerstood near;So light to the croupe the fair lady he swung.So light on the saddle before her he sprung !“ She is won ! we are gone, over bank, bush, andscaur !II They’ll have fleet steeds that follow !’ quoth youngLochinvar1 There vvas mounting ’inong Grannes of the Neth-erby clan"Fosters, Fenwicks, and Musgraves, they rode andthey ran ;1 There was racing, and chasing on Cannobie Lea,But the lost bride of Netherby ne’er did they see !;iSo daring in love and so dauntless in war,I: Have you ere heard of a gallant like young Loch-invar ! Sir Walter Scott.THE FIELD OF WATERLOO.Stop ;—for thy tread is on an Empire’s dustAn earthquake’s spoil is sepulchred below!Is the spot marked with no colossal bust ?Nor column trophied for triumphal show ?None; but the moral’s truth tells simpler so.As the ground was before thus let it be.—How that red rain hath made the harvest grow ;And is this all the world hath gained by thee.Thou first and last of fields—king-making Victory!There was a sound of revelry by night.And Belgium’s capital had gather’d then10Her beauty and ber chivalry ; and brightThe lamps shone o’er fair women and brave men ;A thousand hearts beat happily: and whenMusic arose with its voluptuous swell,Soft eyes looked love to eyes which spake againAnd all wrent merry as a marriage-bell ;— 1But hush ! hark; a deep sound strikes like a rising^!knell IDid you not hear it ?—No ; ’twas but the w ind JOr the car rattling o’er the stoney street;On with the dance ! let joy be unconfined;No sleep till morn when youth and pleasure meet']To chase the glowing hours, with flying feet.But hai’k ! that heavy sound breaks in once moreAs if the clouds its echo would repeat:And nearer, clearer, deadlier than before!Arm! arm ! it is I—it is the cannon’s opening roar!Within a window’d niche of that high hallSat Brunswick’s fated chieftain ; he did hearThat sound the first amidst the festival.And caught its tone with Death’s prophetic ear,And when they smiled because he deem’d it near,,His heart more truly knew that peal too well.Which stretch’d his father on a bloody bier,And roused the vengeance blood alone could quelLHe rush’d into the field, and foremost, fighting, fell 1Ah ! then and there was hurrying to and fro, |And gathering tears, and tremblings of distress,,And cheeks all pale, which but an hour ago sBlushed at the praise of their own loveliness ;And there was sudden partings, such as pressThe life from out young hearts, and choking sighsuWhich ne’er might he repeated: who could guessIf evermore should meet those mutual eyesSince upon nights so sweet such awful morn shouldrise !And there was mounting in hot haste : the steedThe mustering squadron, and the clattering car,Went pouring forward with impetuous speed.And swiftly forming in the ranks of war ;And the deep thunder, peal on peal, afar.And near, the heat of the alarming drumRoused up the soldier ere the morning star;While throng’d the citizens with terror dumb.Or whispering, with white lips—“ the foe ! theycome ! they come ! ’And wild and high the * Cameron’s gathering’roseThe war-note of Loch’el, which Albyn’s hillsHave heard—and. heard too have her Saxon foes;How in the noon of night that pibroch thrills.Savage and shrill! but with the breath whichfillsTheir mountain pipe, so fill the mountaineersWith the fierce native daring, which instilsThe stirring memory of a thousand yeais ;And Evan’s, Donald’s fame,ring in each clansman’sears.And Ardennes waves above them her green leavenDewy with nature’s tear-drops, as they pass.Grieving—if aught inanimate e’er grieves—Over the unreturning brave,—alas !Ere evening to be trodden as the grass.12Which now beneath them, hut above shall growIn its next verdure; when this fiery massOf living valour, rolling on the foe.And burning with high hope, should moulder coldand low ! Lord ByronA BETH GELERTThe spearman heard the bugle sound,and cheerily smiled the morn,And many a brach, and many a hound,attend Llewellyn’s horn ;And still he blew a louder blast,and gave a louder cheer ;Come, Gelert! why art thou the lastLlewellyn’s horn to hear !* Oh, where does faithful Gelert roam ;the flower of all his race!So true, so brave, a lamb at home—a lion in the chase ! ’Twas only at Llewellyn’s board,the faithful Gelert fedHe watch’d, he serv’d, he cheer'd his lord,and sentinel’d his bed.In south, he was a peerless hound,the gift of Royal John ;But now no Gelert could be found,and all the chase rode on.That day Llewellyn little lovedthe chase of hart or hare.nd scant and small the bounty proved,l! for Gelert was not there.npleased, Llewellyn homeward hied,when near the portal seat,is truant Gelert he espied,hounding his lord to greet.t w’hen he gained the castle door,aghast the chieftain stood,re hound was smear’d with gouts of gore,his lips and fangs ran blood;ward in haste Llewellyn passed,(and on wrent Gelert too,)d still where'er his eyes he cast,fresh blood gouts shock’d his view !’erturned his infant’s bed he found,I the blood-stain’d covert rent,nd all around, the walls and gronndwith recent blood besprent.dell-hound ! by thee my child’s devour’d J’the frantic father cried,d to his hilt, his vengeful sword,he plung’d in Gelerts side !is suppliant, as to earth he fell,no pity could impart;t still his Gelert’s dying yell,passed heavy o’er his heart.roused by Gelert’s dying yell,some slumberer ’wakened nigh;ifdiat words the parent’s joy can toll,to hear his infant cry.J14Conceal’d beneath a mangled heap,his hurried search had missed,All glowing from his rosy sleep,his cherub boy he kissed !Nor scratch had he, nor harm nor dread-hut the same couch beneath.Lay a great wolf, all torn and dead-tremendous still in death !Ah ! what was then Llewellyn’s pain Ifor now the truth was clear;The gallant hound the wolf had slain,to save Llewellyn’s heir.Vain, vain was Llewellyn’s woe:best of thy kind adieu !The frantic deed which laid the low,this heart shall ever rue !And now' a gallant tomb they raise,with costly sculpture decked ;And marbles, storied with his praise,poor Gelert’s bones protect.And hear he hung his horn and spear*and oft as evening fell,In fancy’s piercing sounds would hearpoor Gelert’s dying yell.

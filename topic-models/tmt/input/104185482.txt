Theofficers of justice describe him as being a bad boyever since he was able to crawl, and that thisshould have been the ease there is no wonderwhatever, for his mother encouraged her son, e-ven from his boyish days, in evil practiees, andwhenever he committed an act more character-izfd by dexterity and ekilful depravity than an-other, he was sure to be rewarded by the cares-aes and applause of this mo. abandoned andfmost unnatural woman. Such being the fbotmgon which this unfortunate young man was plac¬ed at home, it would be endless to relate all hispetty depredations and misdeeds; suffice it tosay, that he was some years ago banished forthfrom the Gounty ot Renfrew for stealing anmn.vil and a cartwheel from a smith in Mearns, butit was never known by what means he succeed¬ed in making away with the anvil, as it wouL4have required three men at least to have remov¬ed it to any considerable distance. At another•period of his guilty career he was banished fromGlasgow for theft; and on the 12th, May, 1£26,he was tried at the CircuitCourt here for robbinga man of the sum of L.2 Ss., but escaped by averdict of Not Proven. The danger he had e-scaped was immediately forgot, and any slightimpression which had been made by his longconfinement—the ceremony and solemnity ofthe tiial—and tbe..jdoubts and uncertainty liev. felt regarding his fate, were speedily effaced bythe derision with which his fears and his better•feelings were always treated by his cruel andunrelenting parent—she goaded him on in hisguilty and unreflecting careen, until the com¬mission of the deed which brought him to the: gallows.■With this depraved young man, Bell JV^Mc.■0*t4. nemy, when 6he came to Scotland inthe yeas*got acquainted through the medium -of au*other female, and shortly af-terwards, with hismother. Previous to this period no crime wasever impuWd to her, and she had been credita¬bly and industriously employed at a Steam-loomFactory. From dm day her friendship withConnor and his mother began, this unfortunatefemaje herself dated ali her wickedness, and allher misfortunes; she was hurried on from onecrime to another with a rapidity which gave herno time for reflection; *nd she frequently ac¬knowledged after her condemnation, that shehad been guilty of many actions which, in herowr^ apprehension, were as criminal as that forwhich sire was about to puffer. She had beenonce in bridewell for stealing a watch. She wasa good looking woman, about 23 years of age,fair complexion, with red hair, and also camefrom the county of Tyrone.Since the condemnation of the unhappy pri-sonfers, who were both Catholics, they were fre¬quently visited by Bishop Scott, Mossis. M^Gri-gor and M‘Donald, and altogether they behaveded with much propriety, and listened to the reli¬gious advice of thes« gentlemen with seemingpenitence, especially the female prisoner, whosee»ed to be, from the questions she asked, notonly a sensible, but a shrewd young woman.They were recommended to mercy by the J»--xy on account of their youth, and petitions weretransmitted to the proper quarter fpr a comma-ation of ther scntencft> but without effect, onlearning which the female wept bitterly for sometime.Soon after 8 o’clock the unhappy culprits as¬cended the fatal scaffold, attended by tne liev.• Gentlemen who visited them in their lonely cell.The female was dressed in a mourning cap,■ black bombazeen gown, white stockings, andDenmark satin shoes. Connor was also dressedin black. The apparatus of death having beenfinally adjusted, the prisoners shook hands, andafter a short pause, Connor gave the signal,when the drop fell, and after a few struggles,they ceased to exist.On accou»t of the rare occurrence of the ex¬ecution of a female, S5 years having elapsedsince the last woman was executed here, thecrowd was unusually great—not less than from20 to 25,000. It was altogether a melancholyscene. • .Soon after the bodies were taken down two, body-snatchers made a bold attempt to get po*-i session of the corpses, by calling at the prison/and informing the officers that they had beensent by the friends to take away the b?dies, but. being discovered they took themselves off.(i J. ;■'/ <FI CIS.JPXECUTIONS, &c. •TpHE foSowing aBthentic List of Crinrinals w>jo have be5•Executed at Glasgow, are taken from Cleland’s Annaee,or Glasgow, and other official records.

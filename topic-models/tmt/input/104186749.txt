they're of themselves come hoats,And .strange, no longer wish to roam,They centre all in Sally, in Sally,They centre all in Sally,Yet the unkind one damps my joy,And cries I court but to destroy,Can love with ruin tally,My wild desires to rally }But those dear lips, those eyes, I swear,I would all deaths, all torments boar,Bather than injure Sally, injure Saiiv,Bather than injure Sally,Come then, Oh come thou sweeter fayThan violets and roses are,Or lijiea of the valley, of the valley,Or lilies of the valley,O follow love, ami quit your fear,Hfi*!! guide you fro these arms tjiy dear,And mnke

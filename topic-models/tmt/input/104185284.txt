(A Full anJ true Account of the Birth, Life, andDeath of Judas Iscariot ; who was the Sonof SIMON, and of the Tribe and Lineage ofBENJAMIN, 6c.HISTORIANS give an account that Simonthe Father of Judas lived in a fea port*townin the land of Canaan, and married to a kinf-woman of his own, which was alio of the tribe of|Benjamin, being a cuftom, and allowed among the jJews to this day. Now when Simon’s wife was hwith child, (he dreamed two dreams in one night, |and both her dreams were to the fame effett (re-fembling that of Jofeph’s and Pharaoh’s) whichis oblervable among the Jews, that if one Ihoulddream twice, and both to the fame efFett, that itWill certainly come to pafs: After this, (he wasmuch troubled, and dilconlblate in mind that (hecould not eat or drink as {he had wont to do, info-much that her hufband taking notice that (he wasout of order, afked the reafon of her grievance Jfand why {he was fo fad and melancholy ? Nowiifixe being loath to tell him, left it ftiould grieve|fhim alfo, (he waved the dilcourfe with a kind ofkfilent anfwer, and laid (he ailed nothing But herhhufband obferving her countenance ftill fad, didimuch intreat her to latisfy him, why it was fo withliher. At laft (he told him, that {he dreamed twolidreams in one night, and both her dreams wereito the fame effett: and that was. That (he fhould!bring forth that child, which was in her womb,and that he {hould betray the Saviour of the world,and that was the caufe of her great grief and dif icontent. Her hufband being much aftoniftied atthe expreffions of his wife and her dreams, ftoocfome-'[33fomewhat amazed at the faying, and after a littleoonfideration drove to perluade his wife to be con¬tented, and not to grieve and pine herfelf away foas (he did, and he would find a way after the childwas born to prevent this. So when the time wasfulfilled, (lie was brought to bed of a ftrong livelychild to look to as moft was, and they being loathto lay violent hands upon him themfelves, for theythought that was too horrible a faft. But Simonbeing,a rich man, wanted not confederates enoughto accompliflt his defign. So he caufed a boat to bebuilt with all manner of conveniencies that couldpoffibly be made in it.Now this being finifhed, they obferved when thetide of ebb ran out of the harbour, and alfo a hardgale of wind blew off the (hore, that they arrayedthe child in very rich raiment, and fo conveyedhim into the boat, and turned it, and (et the childa drift to Providence and the mercy of the feas.Now it happened, that fome fi(her-men that be¬longed to the illand of Ifcariot were at fea a (idl¬ing, and they efpied a boat at fome diftance fromthem a drift in the fea, and (b made towards it,but as foon as the came on board and opened thecabin-door that was in the boar, found a youngchild crying in the craddle, very richly arrayed, likefome nobleman or prince’s fon. Now after takinglome care (or preferving the young babe’s life, theymade what hade they could for the ifland of Ifca¬riot frem whence they came.After they came on (hore they came to the princeof the ifland, and told what had happened to themat (ea. The prince came to the boat himfelf to feethe child, and wondering at fuch a miraculous pro¬vidence, he forthwith ordered that a nurfe fhouldbe provided for him.So[ 4 3So after a while he grew up and was fem to j'fchool, and educate in all the learning that iflandcould afford him ; after that he was fent fjr to theprince’s court; who loved him fo well, that he al¬lowed him as much attendance as his own fbn had;fo he being made equal with the young prince, thedevil began to enter into his covetous heart be¬times : for when he was about fixteen years of age,he thought to himfelf, that if he could any waysmake away with this young prince, then he fhouldbe heir to the ifland of Ifcariot after the old prince’sdeceale.So at one time they were walking together totake their recreation in the fields, and no body with jthem at this time but themfelves, Judas thought !this a fit time for him to accomplifti his wicked de-fign. And as they were coming along, they camewhere there was a deep pit, which had fome wa¬ter a* the bottom of it, then Judas turning out ofthe way from the young prince to look down intoit, the prince afked him what he was doing there ?He prelently 'replied, that he faw fbmething morethan ordinary in the pit, but what it was he couldnot rightly dilcern t The poor innocent prince be¬ing curious to fee what was therein, came to thebrink of the well to look down there, and then Ju¬das treacherous like, as he was, came behind him,and with all his might thruft him down headlonginto the well, where he miferably ended his life.Now when the young prince was a-miffing, greatfearch was made for him through the ifland, but all tin vain ; but fome whifpered it about that he wasfeen along with Judas on the day he was milling,and mufl needs know what is become of him. Ju¬das hearing this noiled abroad, and his confcienceaccufing him withal, thought it no: fit for him toabideabide there; and having furnifhed himfelf with acompetent fbm of filver and gold, as he was wontto do, he went to the fea-fide, and there found afliip making ready to go out of the harbour; heaiked the dripper very cunningly where they werebound, they immediately told him, and he faid hewas bound for the fame port, and afked the Ikip^per if he would take in a paffenger, and he wouldhandfomely reward him, fo the flripper and hefbon agreed: and then embarked and let fail. Now'Judas thought himfelf fecure, not feeing the ven¬geance following him. The (hip after two orthree days failing came to Rome the defired har¬bour, then Judas came alhore, and after he wasthere a while, he being of great parts, and a]fo en¬dued with much natural wit, kept company withthe chiefeft in the town: At laft he came to be ve¬ry gracious with Pontius Pilate, fo he became hisparticular friend, infomuch, that he kept him in hishoule. Now at one time as they were walking to¬gether, they happened to come in fight of an or¬chard wherein was great plenty of choice fruit, foPontius Pilate cafi: his eye on the orchard, and wilh-ed he could get fome of the fruit, he would gladlygive any money for them. Judas made anfwer,No doubt, the gentleman that owes the orchardwill give fome of them for money, no fays he. Thegentleman that owes them will take no money ofme for them, and to accept them as a prelent is be¬low me. When he came home to dinner, the frmtwas fo much in his mind, that he could not forbeartalking of them : Well fir, fays Judas, Have pati¬ence to-day, and I will get you fbtne of them foryour dinner to-morrow.Now 'Judas went to fleep that night berimes,and next moraing rofe early and went toward theorchard;C 6 2orchard; and when he came there he boldly clim¬bed over the wall and got in : Now by this timethe fun arifing, the gentleman happened to rile,and looking out at his window, he elpied a man inhis garden, he then put on his morning gownand flippers, and came to his orchard, where Ju¬das was plucking off the choiceft of his fruit, andfeeing he appeared fomewhat like a gentleman,rebuked him very mildly, laying to him, “ Sir,“ this is very uncivil of a gentleman, to come in-“ to my garden without my leave, and to take the“ choice!! of my fruit.” Judas makes no more ado,but took up a flone and threw it at the gentleman’shead and knocks his brains our, and fo went hisway, but the gentleman’s wife milling her hufband,enquired of the family whether any of them didnot fee him that day ? And they faid they did notlee him : So after diligent fearch was made, theyfound him dead, with his brains knocked out in hisown garden, great enquiry was made, but it couldnot be found who did the faft.Now Judas after he came home, prelented Pilatewith fame of his ftollen fruit, which he accepted asa prefent: Ahd now he was more in favour withhim than before.So after he had been with him about two years,he afked him, whether he had a mind to alter hiscondition and betake himlelf to a wife, if he did,he knew a very rich widow, and he would do whathe could to help him in that matter. Judasvery obligingly thanked him for his favour, andthat he would gladly embrace fuch an occalion :fo Pilate and Judas went to the widow, and afterlome time Ihe gave confent, and they were marri¬ed together And for fometime they lived verylovingly together.NowNow at one time when they were both in bed,Judas called for a ftirt to (hift himfelf, as he tookoff his fhirt, (he efpied a black fpot upon-his back,the fame form, and in the fame manner as her fonhad, that her firft hylband (ent in a boat adrift tothe fta; at which (he gave a great figh, and roleout of bed, when (he was at dinner (he could eatno meat, but was very melancholy and (ad, Judas(eeing her (b, a(ked her very earneftly what wasthe matter of her trouble, or if he was any waysthe caufe of her (brrow ? She faid no, he was notthe caufe as (he knew of; fo he being very earnedto know, at lad (he told him. That (he dreamedtwo dreams, when (he wasfird with child, that thechild that was in her womb, (hould betray the Sa¬viour of the world. After the child was born, beingtwo or three months old, my hufband and I con-(ented, with the advice of friends, that a boat (houldbe built, and ordered all manner of conveniencyon board of it, and alfo with his name written ina piece of paper pinned at his bread, and let theboat and him adrift to the mercy of the (eas. Andnot two years ago, my hulband’s brains was knock¬ed out with a done, as he was walking in his gar¬den. This I looked upon as a jud judgment fordoing fo barbaroully with an innocent child : andwhen I faw the black fpot upon your back, it putme in mind of my child : Now when Judas heardher lamentable dory he cry’d out, Oh I am the man!So began to tell her how that he was taken in aboat at fea, by Ibme that did belong to the ifland ofIfcariot, and likewile told her how he had killedthe prince of Ifcariot’s fon, that brought him up ;and he was the man that killed as he underdoodthe man that was his father in the garden ; nowl am married to you my mother*, and fo came a-wayway from her, being almofl: in a defpairing condi¬tion as he did at laft. So about this time, ourblefled Lord and Saviour began publicly to preachforgtvenels of fins to all that would believe in thename of God, though the fin be never fb heineousand criminal.Judas hearing the power of Jefiis, and knowinghimlelf to be a notorious finner, as the worft ofmen fometimes may have good thoughts, whentaken to be one of the apoftles. Note, Our blefledLord and Saviour knew what he was, and what hewould be, there he was accepted, and there con¬tinued for a while, but it was no longer than hefound an opportunity to betray our Saviour Chrift,and he fold him for thirty pieces of filver.After that he repented of that horrid aft, whichwas worfe than all the reft that he did in his Jife,and then fell into defpair of mercy with God- Af¬ter that he went out and hanged himfelf, and allhis bowels gufhed out.,.It is known when a malefaftor commits hightreafon, againft the king that the executioner ripsopen his belly, and takes out his heart, and holdsit in his hand, in view of all the fpeftators, cryingthere behold the heart of a traitor : And for Judaswho was a traitor to the King of kings, it was nowonder that the ream of his belly did burft afunder:that all who pafled by might behold his treacherousheart.FINIS,i

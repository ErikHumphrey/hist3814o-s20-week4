His pa¬rents worked at hedging and ditchingfor their livelihood, and brought theirfon up to the fame occupation. He gothis daily bread in his youth, by thefemeans ; but being very much addodedto idlenefs, and not chufing to be con¬fined to any honeil employment, he lefthis father and mother, and ran awayinto the defart part of the. country, tak¬ing with him a woman, as viciouflyinclined as himfelf, thefe two took theirhabitation'in a Rock by the Sea-fideon the {hare of the county of Devon,where they lived upwards of twenty- fiveThe* History of Jyears without going into any city,town or village.In this time they had a great numberof children and grand-children whomthey brought up after their own man¬ner, without the lead; notion of huma-i nity or civil fociety. They never keptany company but among themfelves,and fupported themfelves by robbing,being moreover fo very cfuel, that theynever robbed any one but what they! murdered.By this bloody method and their liv¬ing fo retired from the world, they con¬tinued a long time undifcovered, there: ^being nobody able to guefs how the peo¬ple vrere loft who went by the place wherethey lived. As foon as they had robbedand murdered any man, woman or childthey ufed to carry off their carcafes totheir den, where cutting theminto quar¬ters, they would pickle their mangledlimbs, and afterwards eat them, it be¬ing.their fubfiftance.All. the people in the adjacent partswere alarmed at fo uncommon a lofs oftheir-neighbours ; for there was no tra¬velling near the den of thefe wretches.This occafioned- fpies to be fent intothefe parts, many of whom never re¬turned again, and thofe who did, afterthe itridielt fearcH and enquiry couldnot find out how thefe melancholy mat- 1ters happened. There were feveral ho-neft travellers taken up upon fufpicion,and wrongfully hanged ; feveral inno¬cent innkeepers were executed for no o~ther reafons than that the perfons whohad been loft were known to have lain attheir houfes, which occafioned fufpicionof their being murdered by diem, andtheir bodies privately buried in obfeureplaces to prevent difcovery. Thus anill-placed Juftice was executed with thegreateft feverity imaginable, in order toprevent thefe frequent attrocious deeds,that the innkeepers, who lived on theweftern road, left off their bufinefs forfear of being made examples of, andfollowed other employments ; this onthe other hand occafioned many greatinconveniences to palfengers, who werenow in very great diltrefs for want of ac¬commodation for themfelves and theirhorfes, when they were difpofed to baitor to put up for lodging at night. Ina word, the whole country was depo¬pulated,John’s family was at lafi grown ve¬ry large, and every branch, as fcon asable, affilted in perpetrating their wick¬ed deeds, which they followed with im-.( *5 )punity : fometimes they would attackfour, five, or fix footmen together, butnever more than two if on horfeback.They were alfo very careful that nonefhould efcape, an ambufcade being laidon every fide to fecure them every way,how then was it pofiible they fhould bedetected, when not one that faw themever perceived any body afterwards ?The place they inhabited was folitaryand lonelbme, and when the tide cameup, it reached a mile under ground, fothat when fome had been fent armed,they paHed by the mouth of the cavewithout any notice, - not fuppofing anything human would live in fuch a placeof horror.The number of people they deftroyedwas never known, but it was computedin twenty-five years they had murderedone thoufand men, women, and chil¬dren, and the manner they were difco-vered was as follows.A man and his wife behind him onthe fame horfe coming home from a fair,and falling into an ambufcade of thefewretches, they attacked him in a furi¬ous manner : The man to fave himfelffought bravely, riding fome of themdown by main force, but in the con¬flict, the poor woman fell from behind—  — him and was mitantly murdered beforeIlls face, the female cannibals cuttingher throat, and fucking lier blood withas great gull, as tho’ it had been wine.This done, fkey ripp’d her up, and pull’d *out her entrails ; which difinal fpedlaclecaufed the man to make the more refin¬ance. It pleafed Providence,while he wasengag’d, thirty people came in a bodytogether from the fair; on which JohnGregg and his crew withdrew, andmade the beft of their way thro’'a woodto theif den.This was the firfi: man that ever fell intheir way and came oil alive: He toldthe company what had happened, and, fhew’d the mangled body of his wife,.which the murderers had not time tocarry off. They were ftruck with a-mazement, and went and made it knownto the Mayor of Exeter, who immedi¬ately lent to the king, in a few days hisMajeflv in perfon with a body of aboutfour hundred men, let out for thq placewhere thefe tragedies were adled, in or¬der to find out this hellifh crew, whichfio long had been a nuifance to that partof th * Kingdom. The man who hadbeen attacked was the guide, and care- ,was taken to have a large number ofblood hounds, that no human means' ,.( 7 )might be wanting to put an end to thole >■barbarous cruelties. No hgn of habi¬tation was found for a long time ? andeven when they came to the cave of thefewretches, they took no notice of it, butwere going to purfue their fearch alongthe fhore, the tide being then out j butfome of the blood hounds luckily enter--ed the cave, and fet up fuch a hideousbarking and yowling, that the king andhis attendants went back and looked in¬to it, but could not think that any thinghuman was there. Neverthelcfs, as thehounds went further in, they increafedtheir nolle and refufed to come back ;torches were immediately. had, and agreat many men entered thro’ the mo ftintricate windings, ’till they came to theprivate rccefs of the murderers : thenthe whole body of them went in, andfaw the difmal fight, and were ready tofink into the earth to fee fuch a multi¬tude of arms, legs, thighs, hands, andfeet of men, women, and children, hungup in rows, like dry’d beef, and a greatmany lying in pickle. They alfo founda quantity of money, watches, rings,fwords, piftols, and a large quantity ofcloathes and other things, which theyhad taken from thofe they had murdered.John’s family at this time confifled ofhimfelf, his wife, eight fons, fix daugh¬ters, eighteen grand-fons, and fourteengrand-daughters, begotten in inceft-:they then were all feized and pinioned ;they took what huaKr»i fiefh they found,and buried it in the fands, then takingall the fpoil, they returned to Exeterwith the prifoners, the country peopleflocking round to fee the curfed tribe.When they came to the town, they werecommitted to the goal, andnextday con¬ducted under a ftrong guard to Ply¬mouth, where they were all executedwithout any procefs, it being needlefsto try any creatures Vtrho were fueh pro-fefs’d enemies to mankind.The men had firlt their privy mem¬bers cut off and thro wn into the fire be¬fore their faces ; and then their handsand legs were cut off, by which ampu¬tation they bled to death fome hours af¬terwards.The wife, daughters, and grand chil¬dren having been made fpe&ators ofthis juft pumihmentinflictedon the men,were burnt to death in three feveral fires.They all dy’d without the leaft fign ofepentance, and continued curfing andwearing the moil: horrid Imprecations:o the laft gafp of breath.E INIS.

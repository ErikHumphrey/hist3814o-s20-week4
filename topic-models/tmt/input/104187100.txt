THEI.IJPE AH1* l>EATirOFFAIR RB8AN0NB,CONCUBINE TOKING HENRY II.FAIR ROSAMOND.When as King Henry rul’d this land,The second of that name;Besides the queen, he loved dearA fair and courtly dame.Most peerless was her beauty found,Her favour and her face ;A sweeter creature in the world,Could never prince embrace.Her crisped locks, like threads of goldAppear’d to each man’s sight;Her comely eyes, like orient pearDid cast a heavenly light.The blood within her crystal cheeks,Did such a colour drive,As though the lily and the roseFor mastership did strive.Fair Rosamond, fair Rosamond,Her name was called so,To whom dame Eleanor our queen,Was known a deadly foe.The king therefore, for her defenceAgainst the furious queen,At Woodstock budded such a bower,The like was never seen.‘V*'**-Most curiously llie tower was built,Of stone and timber strong,One hundred and fifty doorsDid to this tower belong.And they so cunningly contrived,With turnings round about,That none without a clue of threadCould enter in or out.Now, for his love and lady's sake,Who was both fair and bright.The keeping of the tower he gaveUnto a valiant knight.But fortune that doth often frown,Where it before did smile,The king's delight, the lady’s joy,Full soon she did beguile.For why, the king’s ungracious son,Whom he did high advance,Against bis father raised wars,Within the realms of France.But yet before our gracious kingThe English land forsook,Of Rosamond, his lady fair,His farewell thus he took.My Rosamond, my lovely Rose,Who pleaseth best mine eye,The fairest flower in all the worldTo feed my phantasy.The flower of my aft'ected heart,Whose sweetness doth excel,My Royal Rose, an hundred timesI bid you now farewell.For I must leave my fairest Rose,My sweetest Rose apace,And cross the ocean into FranceProud rebels to debase.But still my Rose, be sure thou shallAnd in my heart, when hence I am,I'll bear my Rose with me.When Rosamond, the lady bright,Did hear the king say so,The sorrows of it grieved her so,Her outward looks did show.And from her clear and crystal eyes,The tears gush’d out apace,And like the silver pearl dewRan down her comely face.And falling down into a swoon,Before King Henry’s face,Full oft within his princely armsHer body did embrace.And twenty times with wat’ry eyes,He kiss’d her tender cheek,Until he had revived againHer spirit mild and meek.My coming shortly see,Why grieves my Ruse ? my sweetest Rose,The king did often say;Because, said she, to bloody warsMy lord must pass away.But since your grace in foreign parts,Amongst your foes unkind.Must go to hazard life and limb,Why must I stay behind ?Nay, rather let me like a pageThy sword and target bear,That on my breast the blow may lightThat would offend my dear.O, let me in your royal tentPrepare your bed at night,And with sweet baths refresh you there,As you return from fight.So I your presence will enjoy,No toil J will refuse;But wanting you my life is death,Which doth true love abuse.Content thyself, my dearest love,Thy rest at home shall be,In England's sweet and pleasing court,For travels fit not thee.Fair ladies brook not bloody wars,Sweet peace their pleasure breed,The nourisher of heart’s cqntent,Whose fancy first doth feed.My Rose shall rest in Woodstock bowerWith music’s sweet delight,While I among the piercing pikesAgainst the foes do fight.My Rose in robes of pearl and gold,With diamonds rich and bright,Shall dance the galliards of my love,While I my foes do smite.And you, Sir Thomas, whom I trust,To be my love’s defence.J3e careful of my gallant Rose,When I am parted hence.And here withal he fetch’d a sigh,As though his heart would break;And Rosamond, for very grief,Not one plain word could speak.And at their parting, well they mightIn heart be grieved sore,After that day fair RosamondThe king did ne’er see more.For when his grace had passed the seas,And into France was gone,Queen Eleanor with envious heart,To Woodstock came anon.And forth she calls the trusty knightWho kept this curious bower,And with a clue of twisted thread,Conic from this famous flower./But when they had wounded him, -The queen the thread did get,And went where Lady 'RosamondWas like a lady set.,1:8 ; 1But when the queen with stedfast eyesBeheld her lovely face,She was amazed in her mind,At such exceeding grace.Bast off, said she, those fine wrought robes,That rich and costly be,And drink you up this deadly draughtWhich I have brought to thee.But presently upon her kneesFair Rosamond did fall,And pardon of the queen she craved,For her offences all.Take pity of my youthful years,Fair Rosamond did cry;And let me not with poison strong,Be forced for to die.I will renounce my sinful life,And in some cloister hide,Or else be banished, if you please,To range the world so wide.And sure the fault which I have done,I was forced thereunto;Preserve my life, and punish meAs you think fit to do.8.1i 'JAnd with tliese words, her lily hands,She wrung full often there,And down her comely faceProceeded many a tear.But nothing could this furious queenHerewith appeased be,Except the cup of deadly poison,Which she held on her knee.She gave this comely dame to drink,Who took it from her hand,And from her bended knees arose.And on her feet did stand :When, casting up her eyes to heaven,She did for mercy call,And drinking up the poison strong,She lost her life withal.And when that death thro’ every limhHad done its greatest spite,Her chief foes could but confess, .She was a glorious sight.Her body then they did entomb,When life was fled away.At Woodstock near to Oxford town,

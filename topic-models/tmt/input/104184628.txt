I must now despair.For ah ! I am grown very old.And it's, oh dear, &c.And now I must die an old maid.Oh dear ! how shocking the thought:And all m^ beauty must fade.But I’m sure it’s not my own fault.And it’s, oh dear, &c.,The Days o’ Langsyne.When war had broke in on the peace o’ auld men,Frae Chelsea to arms they were summon’d again,Twa vet’rans,grown gray, wi’ their muskets sair fil’d.With a sigh were relating how hard they had toil’d :The drum it was beating, to fight they incline.But ay they look’d back on the days of langsyne3<) Davy, man, wed thou remembers the time,f When twadaft bit callants, and just in our prime;'The prince led us,conquer’d,apd show’d us the way.And mony branv chi. Id we turn’d cauld on that day:Still again I wad venture this aujd trunk o’ miue,^Coil’d our gen j alsbut lead, or we fight like langsyne.But garrison.duty is a’ we can dp,[ Tho' our arms arq worn weak, yet ou£ hearts arestill true;We fear’d neither danger by land or by sea.But time is turn’d coward, and no you and me;And tho’ at our fate we may sorely repine.Youth winna return, nor the days o’ langsyne.When after our conquest, it joys me to mind.How thy Jean caress’d thee, and my Meg was kind;They shaKd a’ our dangers, tho’ ever sae hard.And we car’d na for plunder, when sic our reward ;Even now they're resolv’d baith their hames to re-sign.And to share the hard fate they were us’d to lang¬syne.T/ie Cobler.Last week I took a wife,And when I first did woo her,I vow’d to stick through life.Like cohler’s w&x, unto her ;But soon we went, by some mishap,To loggerheads together.And when my wife began to strap.Why, I began to leather.My wife, without her shoes.Is hardly three feet seven;And I, to all men’s views,Am full five feet eleven.So when, to take her down some pegs,I drubb’d her neat and clever,4She piade a bolt right through my legs.And ran away for ever.When she was gone, good lackMy hair like hog’s-hair bristled?I thought she’d ne’er come back,So went to work and whistled ;Then let her go, I've got my stall,Which may no robber rifle,’Twould break my heart to lose my aWl,To lose my wife’s a trifle.The Arethusa.Come all ye jolly sailors bold,Whose, hearts are cast in honour’s nwuld,While English glory I unfold,Huzza to the Arethusa !She is a frigate tight and brave.As ever stemm’d the dashing wave,Her men are staunchTo their fav’rite launch,And when the foe shall meet our fire,Sooner than strike, we’ll all expireOn board of the Arethusa.’Twas with the spring fleet she went out,The English Channel to cruise about,When four French sail, in show so stout,Bore down on the Arethusa.The fam’d Belle Poole straight a-head did lie, ;The Arethusa seem’d to fly ;Not a sheet, or a tack,Or a brace did she slack;Though the Frenchmen laugh’d and thoughtit stuff;But they knew not the handful of men, howtough,On board of the Arethusa.5,On deck five hundred men did dance.The stoutest they could find in France ;We with two hundred did advance,On board of the Afethusa.Our captain hail'd the Frenchmen, ho !The Frenchmen they cried out, hallo !Bear down, d’ye see,To our admiral’s lee :No, no, says the Frenchmen, that can’t be ;Then I must lug you along with me,Says the saucy Arethusa.The fight was off the Frenchmen’s land ;We forc’d them back upon their strand;For we fought till not a stick would standOf the gallant Arethusa.And now we’ve driven the foe ashore,Never to fight with Britons more,Let each fill a glassTo his favourite lass ;A health to our captain and officers true.And all that belong to the jovial crewOn board of the Arethusa.The Thorn.From the white-blossom’d sloe my dear ChloerequestedA sprig her fair breast to adorn ;No, by heavens! I exclaim’d, may I perish,If ever I plant in that bosom a thorn.When I shew’d her the ring, and implor’dher to marry,She blush’d like the dawning of morn ;Yes, I’ll consent, shereply’d, if you’ll promise.That no jealous rival shall laughme to scorn.No, by heavens! I exclaim’d, may I perish,If ever I plant in that bosom a thorn.6Gaffer Gray.Ho ! Why dost thou shiver and shake, -GafferGray ?And why dost thy nose look so blue ?^Tjs the weather that's cold,’Tis I’m grown very old,And my doublet is not very new :'Well-a-day !Then Hue thy worn doublet with ale, GafferGray,And warm thy old heart with a glass;Nay, but credit I’ve none,And my money’s all gone,Then say, how may that come to pass ?Well-a day!Hie away to the diouse on the brow, GafferGray,And knock at the jolly priest’s door.The priest often preachesAgainst worldly riches.But ne’er gives a mite to the poor;Well-a-day IThe lawyer lives under the hill. Gaffer Gray,Warmly fenc’d both in back and in front.He’lbsoon fasten his locks.And will threaten the stocks,Should he ever more find me in want;Well-a-day !The squire has fat beeves, and brown ale,Gaffer Gray;And the season will welcome you there.7His fat beeves and his beer,And his merry new year,Are all for the flush and the fair;Well-a-day !My keg it is low, I confess, Gaffer Gray ;What then, while it lasts, man, we'll live.The poor man alone.When he hears the poor moan.Of his morsel a morsel will give;Well-a-day !Tfie Irish Wedding.Sure, won’t you hear what roarhjg cheerWas spread at Paddy’s wedding, O,And how so gay, they spent the day.From the churching to the bedding, O.First, boek in hand, came Father Quipes,With the bride’s dada- the bailie, O,White all the way to church the pipesStruck up a lilt so gaily, O.Pith.erum hi, &c.Then there was Mat, and sturdy Pat,And merry Morgan Murphy, O;And Murdock Maggs, and Tirlogh Skeggs,Maclochlan, and Dick Durfey, O :And then the girls dress’d out in whites.Led on by Dad O' Reily, O,A11 jigging) as the merry pipesStruck up a lilt so gaily, O.When Pat was ask’d, would his love last ?The chancel echo’d wid laughter, O !Arrah fait, cried Pat, you may say dat.To the end of the world and after, 0Then tenderly her hand he gripes.And kisses her genteelly, O,■ ‘8While all m tune Ihe merry pipes •Struck up a_Hlt_so gaily,' O.Now a roarfrig'set at cTinher are .rriet,,'So frolicksome and so friskw, O,Potatoes galore, a skirraikpr qwntR, <:a flowing madder of p-hi^ky, O fTo the bride s dear health round; W-cnt the swipc^That her joy might be nightly and daily, O,And as they.gitttfed,. tHft nfcii^ pipesStruck up a Hit so’ gaHy, 0.And then at night.

Neilsor.,FOR THE AUTHOR,1806.\2The only motive that lias induced the Authorto publish this Manual, is the importance of theart which it is intended to elucidate. By analyz¬ing letters into their constituent parts, the Pupilwill more readily acquire an accurate knowledgeof their different proportions.The long experience in teaching, and the par¬ticular attention which he has paid to the usefuland important art of Pemmanshit, will, it ishoped, justify him in offering this small work tothe Public.Paisley, ut. Jan. 1806.A Recipe for making Ink,By the late celebrated Dr. BLACK, Professorof Chemistry in Edinburgh.Take of Logwood one ounce. Green Vitriol one ounce,Galls three ounces, and Gum Arabic one ounce and a half,soft water two mutchkius and a ha’f. First, boil the Logwoodin the water, then pour the hot infusion, strained, uponthe Galls : the Galls; should he finely powdered, the Li¬quor is then taken out and strarned, and the Vitriol andGum Arabic are added. The Gads should remain in theL .-wood infusion for two or three da^s, then add the othertna-erials, which should remain five or six days longer;and then strain it through a cfcth,. and it will be fit for use.RULESFORWRITING THE SMALL LETTERS.Chance may spoilA single aim ; hut Perfeverance mustProsper at last. Home.o RESEMBLES an oval, its breadth istwo thirds of its length, and is the famewith that of n, and is ufed as a meafure forother letters.The dihance from the top to the bottomof o is generally called a length, and fromthe left to the right fide of it a breadth, andthe breadth of its downward ftroke a thick-nefs.In making the c, begin on the right fide*a third below the upper line.When o forms a part of other letters, as a,d,g and q, it is a thicknefs lefs than a breadth.b Is four lengths, and the fame breadthas a and d at the bottom.c Is made in the fame manner as an o,4only carry up the hair ftroke, and make afquare cut inclining to the body of the letter.d Is three lengths, and fimilar to a andb at the bottom.e Is the fame as a r, except the loop at thetop, which is half a length, and half abreadth.J Is three lengths above the upper line,and three lengths below the under one. Theloop at the top is two and a half lengths, andtwo-thirds of a breadth j and the crofs ftrokepafies through at the upper line.g Is an o and a j joined together.£ Is a downward ftroke of three lengths,having joined to it the laft half of n.The dots of i and j are on the fameparallel with the top ofp and t.j Is four lengths, and the loop is twolengths, and two thirds of a breadth.h Is )he fame as h, only at the right handfide, the middle of the formative part isturned in towards the downward ftroke./ Is four lengths, and the loop is the fameas that of j',m Is a full breadth, both in the firfl andfecond part.n Is the fame in breadth as e.o And / joined make a, o and / make dyo and j make g.p Is one length above the upper line, andthree below it, and is one breadth.q Conflfts of a narrow o, with a ftraighfcfull broke three lengths downward from theupper line and may be either looped at thebottom on the right hand fide at one thirdof a breadth, or lei: oft' abruptly.r The laft part of this letter when s fol¬lows, fhould be a breadth and a half fromthicknefs to thicknefs.f Is the fame above the upper line as an /,and the fame below it as a j.j Is a breadth, and ends with a full dotupon the hair ftroke. (The dot is now fre¬quently omitted.)t Is one length above the line, on a linewith the top of/>, and the dots of i and j.u Is the fame with the two firft downwardftrokes of an m inverted.v Is the fame with the laft part of butthe fhade at the top muft incline inwards.•w Is the fame with only the fhade in-dines toward the left, as in b and v.a? Is formed of two c’s joined together, thefirfl: inverted.The firft part of y is the laii part of theetter m or n prefixed to a j.z Should have a body flroke at the be¬ginning, middle, and laft part of the letter,,and the fame length below the line, as gjf y-fc Is ufed as a contraction for and in writing, jOBSERVATIONS.b h k and /, are made four lengths of thefmall letters, when looped.The letters p t rife one length above theline in text and half text, and in proportionin fmall write.In crofling t, the hand fhould be raifed ofxthe paper, and the hair ftreke be equal onboth tides, and very fine.The letters f p q and y are the fame lengthbelow the line, when left off abruptly, zs b dh k and / are above the line.The loops at the tops of/and long/, oughtto be fimilar. At the bottom, the former isturned to the right and the latter to the lefthand.The dot of r and the firft part of x fhottldbe the fame.In making m. take the hair ftrokes nearivfrom the bottom of the downward ones, andjoin all the letters that confift of bottom turnscxscfly in the middle : and lift not the penoftener than is abfolutely requisite to jointhe letters properly.In making on, fome take the hair ftrokefrom the middle, others from the top of o.The latter ! would in general recommend.The letters which go above the line, andcannot be looped, are dp and t.When y ends a word as in lady, it may beturned in the fame manner as q.The laft part of n is often made for theletter r, in current hand writing. This ap¬pears to be an innovation, which ought not tobe frequently ufed.The looped letters are preferred in currenthand writing, as they give a fuperior degreeof neatnefs.\8The above rules may be applied to the halftext, only attention muft be paid to the dis¬tance between words, which Should be greaterthan betwixt letters.N.B It is common in marking down figures,to make them ftand a little more uprightthan the writing with which they are con¬nected, and double the fize of the letters.The irregular di/Iaticet between different lettersare of [even kinds.lit. Between the downward ftrokes of rand i are one and a half breadth.2d. Between i and m or /; after it, oneand a half breadth.•3d. Between the downward Strokes of cand if one and a half breadth.4th. Between the two vowels in good, &c.two thirds of a breadth.qth Between i and z, one and a halfbreadth.6th Between the downward Strokes of vand w, two breadths.-th. Between the downward Strokes of 10and .v, two breadths.9gj* ^ circumftances will admit, it is prefer.able to fit with the left hand to the light.RULES FOR THE CAPITALS.ALL capital letters fiiould be at leaftdouble the fize, and ftronger than the fmallletters.Of the three capital letters A, and iV,the dots at the firft part of the letters fromleft to right Ihould be haif the height of thefmall letters.In making IT, and the firft halfof A', the dots ought to be one half in heightof the fmall letters ; and when turned round,as high as the line or fmall letters.All the above letters may be either dotedor turned round, at an equal diftance fromthe hair or body flroke. The laft methodfeems preferable.The turn at the bottom of Z), L, andought to rife one third of the fmall o.The firft parts of the three letters, U, F, andT, ought to be the fame.15The laft parts of N and W are fimilar.The parts of G, J, and 7, w hich go belowthe line, ought to be iimilar, and the underpart of Z, is a C inverted.The firfl parts of H, J, and K, ought to belimilar j only the J goes below the line as j.The firfl; parts of W and Z, ought to befimilar.The firft and fecond parts of B and R are■fimilar to P, the third part of B is turned to¬wards the left, and that of R towards theright hand, the laft part of K is turned in thefame manner.Make F and T fimilar, only the F has ahair ftroke drawn through the downwardftroke with a fmall loop.The firft parts of C and G ought to be fimi¬lar, and by joining j or the laft part of q toC, we make G.J ought to be made when a vowel or diph¬thong follows it, as in June and Joy, and Iwhen a confonant comes after it, as in Idle.The method of making the other parts ofthe capitals depends much upon the tafie ofthe writer.IIIOpportunity to be improved.—Shakespeare.There is a tide in the affairs oi men,hich, taken at the flood, leads on to fortune jfitted, all the voyage of their lifebound in shallows, and in miseries.Bitter Jesting.—Johnson.f all the griefs that harrass the distress’d,liire the most bitter, is a scornful jest.Jite never wounds more deep the gen’rous heart,tan when a blockhead’s insult points the dart.Pride.— Pope.f all the causes which conspire to blindIan’s erring judgment, and misguide the mind,rhat the weak head with strongest bias rules,Piide, the never-failing voice of fools.Love and Esteem better than Riches.— Pope,o whom can riches give repute or trust,lontent or pleasure, but the good and just!Iidges and senates have been bought for gold,steem and love were never to be sold.Vunity of Man —Gay.h ! what is life ! with ills encompass’d round,midst our hopes,, fate strikes the sudden woundo-day, the statesman of new honour dreams,o morrow, death destroys his airy schemes.12Social Nalurc of Mam—Cowper.riod, working ever on a social plan,-Bv various ties attaches man to man :•>He made at first, though free and unconfir.’d.One man the common father of the kind.Tlutual injluaice of Vice and Errour.—Cowper.Faults in-the life breed errour in the brain jAnd these, reciprocally, thofe again.The mind and conduct mutually imprintAnd stamp their image in each other’s mint.dhe Sower.—'I homson.While thro’ the neighb’ring fields the sower stalksWith measur’d step •, and lib’ral throws the grainInto the faithful bosom.of the ground :The harrow follows harsh, and shuts the scene.Love of Solitude.— rickt'll.Sweet fblitude, when life’s gay hours are past ;Howe’er we range, in thee we fix at last ;Toss’d through tempestuous feas, the voyage o’er,Pale we look back, and blefs thy friendly shore.Want of Refection.—Mclmoth.The mind not taught to think, no useful storeTo fix refiection, dreads the vacant hour,Turn’d on itself, its num’rous wants are seen,' nd all the mighty void that lies within.

THE SURPRISINGLife and SufferingsOFPETER WILLIAMSON,Who was carried 'off from Aberdeen in hisInfancy, and sold for a Slave in NorthAmerica.UJLASUUW:Published Wholesale and Retail, by RobertHutchison, Bookseller, 19, Saltmarket.1822./v1THE.LIFE AND SUFFERINGSJUFEMr. PETER WILLIAMSON.V '" ofT Was born in Hirnly, in ibe parish ofAboyne, and county of Aberdeen, NorthBritain, of reputable parents who supportedme in the best manner they could as long asthey had the happiness of having me undertheir inspections but fatally for me, and totheir great grief, I was sent to live with anaunt at Aberdeen; where playing on tlm quaywith my companions, being of a stout tobustconstitution, I was taken notice of by twofellows belonging to a vessel in the harbour,employed (as the trade therv was) by some ofthe worthy merchants of the town in that Vtl-lanous practice called Kidnapping; that is,stealing young children from their parents,and selling them as skives in the Plantationsabroad. Being mark-ed out by these mon¬sters of impiety as their prey, I was cajoledon board the ship by them, where I was nosooner got than they conducted me betweenthe decks, to some others they had kidnappedin the same manner. At that time I had nosense of the fate that was destined for me andspent the time in childish amusements withmy fellow-sufferers in the steerage, beingnever-suffered to go upon deck whilst tbsvessel lay in the harbour; which was until!' 8 . ' .wiliinjily go with them, anti be contentedwith.their ways of living. This I seeminglyagreed to, trusting to Providence f«»r the timewhen I might be delivered out of their hands.Upon this tb.-y untied me, and gave agreat load to carryon my back, tinder whichI travelle*! all that night with them, oppres¬sed with the greatest anxiety of mind, lestmy unhappy wife should have fallen a preyto these cruel-monsters. At day-break, myinfernal masters ordered me to lay down myload, when tying my hands again round atree with a small cord, they forced the bloodout of my J&nger ends. They then kindleda nre near the tree whereto I was bound,which filled me with the most dreadful ago¬nies concluding I was going to be made asacrifice to their barbarity.However, they for some time danced roundme after their manner, with various odd mo¬tions and antic gestures, whooping, holloaing,and crying in a frightful manner, as it is theircustom. Having satisfied themselves in thissort of mirth, they pioceeded in a more tragi¬cal manner, taking the burning coals andsticks fi nning with fire at the end>, holdingthem near my face,' head, hands, and feet,with a deal of monstrous pleasure and satis¬faction; and at the same time threatning toburn me entirely, if I made the least noise,or cried out. Thus tortured as I was, almostto death, I suffered their brutal pleasure with¬out being allowed to vent my inexpressibleanguish otherwisethan by shedding silent tears.their guns, by rushing on their enemies andfracturing or cleaving their skulls •with it, andxfiry setdomfail oj killing at the very first blow.***For this Page, read Page 3 in place of 8.4get, near three weeks, when we were takenin by a vessel bound to Philadelphia lying atthis Island. Very little of the £argo wassaved undamaged, and the vessel entirely lost.When we arrived at Philadelphia; the cap¬tain had soon people enough who came tobiry us. He sold us at about \6iper head.W hat became of my unhappy companions Inever knew; it was my lot to be sold to oneof my countrymen, whose name was HughWilson, for the term of seven years, who hadip his youth undergone the same fate as my¬self: having been kidnapped from St. John-stoun in Sco'Jand.Happy was my lot in falling into my coun¬try-man’s power, as he was a humane, honestman. Having no children of his own, andc?>mmisserating my unhappy condition, hetook great Care of me until 1 was fit for busi¬ness; and from the 12th year of my age, keptme about little trifles till my l-tth year, whenI was more fit for harder work. During suchmy idle state, seeing my fellow servants oftenreading and writing, it incited in me an incli¬nation to learn, which I intimated to my mas¬ter, telling him I should be very willing toserve a year ^nger than I was'bound, if hewould indulge me in going to school; this hereadily agreed to, saying that winter wouldbe the best time. It being then summer, Iwaited with impatience for the other season;but to make some progress -in my design, Igot a friraer and learned as much from myfeHow-s>rvants as I could. At school, whichI attended four winters, I made a tolerableproficiency and have ever since been improv-Wig myself a. leisure hours. ’ When I was! seventeen years old my worthy me$ ter..and, as a reward for my service, left me 2001.currency, which was then about 12QZ. sterling,his best horse* saddle, and all his wearingapparel.Being novf my own master, I employedmyself iji jobbing about the country, withany that would employ me, for near sevenyears: when thinking I had mogey sufficientto follow some better way of life. J resolvedto settle; but thinking one step necessarythereto, was to be married; I applied to thedaughter of a substantial planter, and mattersbeing soon concluded upon we were married.My father-in-law, in order to establish us in< the world made me a deed of gift, of a track; of land, that lay (unhappily for me,) on thefrontiers ef the province of Pensylvania near; the forks of Delaware in berks county, con¬taining about 200 acres 30 of which were' well cleared, and fit for immediate use, where-i on was a good house and barn. 'Pbe placepleasing me, I settled on it; and though itcost me the rcajor part of my money, in buy.ing stock, household furniture, and imple¬ments for out-door work; and happy as I wasin a good wife, yet did my felicity last menot long; . For about the year 1754«, the In¬dians in the French interest, who had for along time ravaged and destroyed other partsunmolested, began to be very troublesome onthe frontiers of our province, where they ge-• ucrally appeared in small skulking parties,with yellings, shoutings, and antic postures,instead of trumpets and drums, committinggreat devastations and cruelties, as these po¬lished, but inhgmab barbarians, the French«paid them for every scalp of an English par¬son 151. Sterling.Terrible and shocking to human naturewere the barbarities committed by the savagesand are not to be paralleled in all the volumesof history! Scarce did a day pass but someunhappy family fell victims to under-handFrench chicanery and savage cruelty. Terri¬ble indeed it proved to me, now happy in aneasy state of life, blessed with an affectionateand tender wife, scarce can I sustain the shockwhich for ever recoils on me, at thinking onthe last time of seeing that gbod woman. Thefatal 2d of October, 1754, she that day wentfrom home to visit some of her relations; asI staid up later than usual, expecting her re¬turn, none being in the house besides myself,how great was my surprise, terror, and af¬fright, when about 11 o’clock at night, Iheard the dismal war-cry, or war-whoop ofthe savages, and to my inexpressible grief,soon found that my house vtas attacked bythem; I flew to the chamber window, and per¬ceived them to be twelve in number. Theymaking several attempts to Come in, I askedthem what they wanted? They gave me noanswer, but continued beating and trying toget the door open. Judge then the conditionI must be in, knowing the cruelty and mer¬ciless disposition of those savages should Ifall into their hands. Having my gun load¬ed in my hand, 1 threatened them with deathif they should not desist. But how vain andfruitless are .the efforts of one man againstthe united force of so many! and frf such mer¬ciless, undaunted, and blood-thirsty monstersas I had here to deal with. One of them7speaking broken English, threatened *ne in«return. “ That if l did not come out, theyi i would burn me alive in the house; tellinga me further, what I unhappily perceived,M That they were no friends to the English,but if I would come out and surrender my¬self prisoner, they would not kill me.” Dis¬tracted as I was in such, deplorable circum¬stances, I chose to rely bn the uncertainty of(j their fallacious promises, rather than meet? with certain death by rejecting them; and nc-) cordingly went out of my house with my gunt in my hand, not knowing what I did, or thatl had. Immediately on my approach, theyn rusted on me like so many tigers, and in-|-standy disarmed me. Having me thus inIt their power, the merciless villains bound me1,1 to a tree near the door: they then went into;i tjie house, and plundered and destroyed everyJ thing in it, carrying off what moveables theya could; the rest, together with the house, which,t they set fire-to, was soon consumed before.myeyes, The barbarians, not satisfied with this,■set fire to my barn stable, and out-houses,wherein were about 200 bushels of wheal, sixcows, four horses, and five sheep, being allentirely consumed to ashes.Having thus finished thecxecrable businessi of my utter ruin, one ol the monsters came toi me with a tomahawk* in his hand, threatningme with the worst of deaths, if I would not„ » * A Tomahawk is a kind of hatchet, madesomething like our plaisterer’s hamm ers, abendtwo feet long, handle and all. To take up thehatchet (or Tomahawk) among them, is to de¬clare war. They generally use it after fring3such time as they had got in their loadingwith a compliment of unhappy youths, forcarrying on their wicked commerce.In about a month’s time the ship set sailfor America; and although we were elevenweeks on our voyage, no occurrence worthnotice happened till we arrived on the coastwe were destined for, a hard gale of windsprung up from the S. E. and, to the captain’sgreat surprise (about twelve o’clock at night)the ship struck on a sand bank off Cape May,near the capes of Delaware, and to the greatterror and affright of the ship’s company, ina short time was almost full of water,boat was then hoisted out, into which thecaptain and his fellow-vijlains, the crew gotwith some difficulty, leaving me and my de¬luded companions to perish, as they then na¬turally concluded ineviuble death to be ourfate. Thus abandoned and deserted withoutthe least prospect of relief, and threatenedevery moment with death, did these villainsleave us. The cries, the shrieks, and tearsofaparcelofinfants, had no effect onor causedthe least remorse in the breasts of these mer¬ciless wretches. The ship being on a sandbank, which did not give way to let her deep¬er, we lay in the same deplorable conditionuntil morning, when, though we saw the landof Cape May, at about a mile’s distance, weknew not what wouhd be our fate.The wind at length abated, and the cap¬tain (unwilling to lose all her cargo) about10 o’clock sent some of his crow in a boat tothe ship’s side to bring Us on shore, where welay in a sort of a camp made of the sails ofthe vessel and such other things as they could, 9j Havin'ratlastsatisfied their brutal pleasure,1 tliey sat down rouud the fire and roasted tht^ meat of which they iiad robbed my dwelling;^ and when they had satiated their voraciaus$ appetites, they olfered some to me, though ittj may be easily-imagined I had but little appe-ii tite to cat, after tjie tortures and miseries Id had undergone; yet was I forced to seemC| pleased with what they offered me, lest, by!f refusing it, they had again resumed theird hellish practices. After the sun was set, theytj put put the fire, and covered the ashes withd leaves, that the white people might not dis-:> cover any traces or signs of their having been8 there.Thus had these barbarous wretches fiuish-i cd their diabolical piece of work; and shock-i ing as it may seem to the humane Englisht heart, jet what I underwent was buL triflingin comparison to the torments and miseries -r which I afterwards saw most inhumanly in¬flicted on others of my unhappy fellow-creatures. •Going from thence, along by the river Sus-quehana loaded as I was before, we arrivedat a spot near the Apaiachian mountains,where they hid plunder under logs of wood.And, oh, shocking to relate! from thence didthese hellish monsters proceed to a neigh¬bouring hous£, occupied by one Jacob Snider,and his uuhappy family, consisting of his wifefive children, and a young man his servant.They soon got admittance into the unfortu¬nate man’s house, where they immediatelywithout the least remorse, Scalped* the ten-* Scalping is taking off the skin from thetop of the head,- which they perform with a10dcr parents and the unhappy children. Norcould the tears, the shrieks, of these unhap¬py victims prevent their horrid massacre, forhaving thus seal red them and plundered thehouse of every thing that was moveable, theyset fire to the same, where the poor creaturesmet their final doom, whilst the hellish mis¬creants stood at the door rejoicing, and echo¬ing back in their diabolical manner, thepiercing cries, heart-rending groans, and pa¬ternal and affectionate toothings, which is¬sued from this most horrid sacrifice of an in¬nocent family. Shocking as these barbaritiesmust appear to the human heart, it must feelredoubled horror when we mention the othermeans niade use of by the unprovoked andalways treacherous enemies of Britain—theFrench.As the Indians worship the images of someinferior deities, whose anger they seem todread;and on which account t|ie generality ofour travellers denominate the objects of theirdevotion, devils; though at the same time itlong knife that they hang round their neck andcarry with them. They cut the skin round asmuch of the head as they think proper, some,times quite round from the neck and forehead,then take their fingers and pluck it off, and of¬ten leave the unhappy creatures so served, todie in a most miserable manner Some whoare not cut too deep in the temples or skull,live in horrid torments many hours, and some¬times a day or two after The scalps or skinsthus taken off, they preserve and carry homein triumph where they receive, as is said before.Considerable sum for every one.11>f is allowed they pray to their inferior deitiesf for success in all their undertakings for plcn-I ty of food, and other necessaries of life; it ap-| pears*8180 that they acknowledge on’supremeBeing; but him they adore not, because theyI believe he is too far exalted above them, andI too happy in himself, to be concerned aboutt the trifling affairs of poor mortals. They3 seern also to believe a future state; and that,after death, they will be removed to theirfriends, who have gone before them to anElysium or Paradise beyond the Westernmountains. Now the French Priests, whoare sent among them under pretence of in¬structing them in die Christian religion, toaid the political views of their nation, haveinstilled into these Indians a belief, “ Thatthe Son of G -d came into the world to saveall mankind and destroy all evil spirits thatnow trouble them; that the English have kill¬ed him, and that ever since, the evil spiritsare permitted to walk on the earth: that ifthe English were all destroyed, the Son ofthe Good Man, who is God, would comeagain, and banish all eCil spirits from theirlands, and then they would have nothing tofear or disturb them.” Cajolled by thesefalse but artful insinuations of the FrenchJesuits, the Indians from that time have en¬deavoured to massacre all the English, in or¬der that the Son of God might come againon the earth, and rid them of such slavishfears and terrible apprehensions, by extermi¬nating the objects thereof.After that 40 years have elapsed since thecommission of those most barbarous inhuma¬nities, 1 cannot but take notice of the justice12ef Providence in so exemplary a mannerpunishing that most cfuel, sanguinary, andintriguing nation the French, \Vho have beenfrom the earliest accounts of their nation,either the perpetrators or inciters to not onlythese unsuspicious barbarians exercising theiringenious cruelties on their friends the Eng¬lish, but to all the wars, massacres, and per¬secutions that have, and now lay waste Eu¬rope.—At the beginning of the many Revo¬lutions that have happened since 1790 inFrance, we see them butchering the wholemass of their priests, with the same unrelent¬ing fury as these prostituted missionariescaused the ignorant nations of Indians to ex¬ercise in America; next they destroy the mostprobable rallying point that the wise and mo¬derate of that nation could martial themselvesround to overturn the crowd of tyrants that •were ruining the country; these rtiiscreantscruelly butcher the King and Queen, anddeclare to the nation that they had gainedthem liberty, but it was only the assumed li¬berty of that Convention to guillotine everyman or woman who was not entirely submis¬sive to their unlimited despotism! A partialvictory, in the winter of 1792, over the Aus¬trians in Flanders shows us their- GeneralDemourier, with like impudence to the devilin heaven, before the fall, assuming the lan¬guage of the Almighty, publishing in hismanifestos that he would not only overthrowthe governments of Britain and Holland, butthat he would make war, or “ say to thetroubled nations be still” as he thought pro¬per—Reiying on the invulnerableness of thisgasconader, and to keep the people of France»ISi from thinkingthe Convention orderDem wrierlinto Holland, seize on all the English shipstin the French Ports, and declare war againstBritain: thus exposing themselves notonlj toI the resentment of every surroundiag nation,< but rousing the reveng-e of the moderate peo¬ple then remaining in France, who saw thatlif they did not instantly oppose themselves to(the assumed rulers of their country, everyI hope of saving it from the scourge of such aiGovernment would be totally dissipated,tHence we see this nation, after all its at¬tempts to gain universal dominion, harrassedjwith internal and external enemies, while1 their rescources of war are now almost ex-Ihausted; and the life and property of everyindividual seized on by the cruel harpies ofdemocracy, as they think fit. And these, myiCountrymen, these would be your advantages,|if you allow yourselves to be drawn into, the'vortex of discontent which the lazy, and thoset who have nothing to lose, have excited in our!happ) and envied country, against the bestKing that ever wielded the British sceptre,(and the best Constitution.that ever was esta-{ blished in the world.After this carnage and murder last men-i tioned, they kept on their course near the;i mountains, where they lay skulking four ori five days, rejoicing at the plunder and store! they had got. When provisions becamei! scarce, they made' their way towards Susqnc-i hana; where still to add to the many barbari-ii ties they had already committed passing neari another house, inhabited by an unhappy oldman, whose name was John Adams, with hiswife and four small children; and meeting14 •with no resistance, they scalped (he unhappywife and her four small children, before thegood old man's eyes. Inhuman and horridas this was, it d|d not satiate them; for when*they had murdered the poor woman, theyacted with her .in such a brutal manner, asdecency, or the remembrance .of the crimewill not permit me to mention; and this evenbefore the unhappy husband, who, not beingable.to avoid the sight, and incapable of af¬fording her the least relief, entreated them toput an end to his miserable being; but theywere as deaf and regardless to the tears, pray¬ers, and entreaties of this venerable sufferer,as they had been to those of the others, andproceeded in their cruel purpose of burningand destroying his house, barn, corn, bay,cattle, and every thing the poor man a fewhours before was master of. Having savedwhat they thought proper from the dames,they gave the old man, feeble, weak, and inthe miserable condition he then was, as wellas myself, burdens to carry, and lordingthemselves likewise with bread and meat,pursued their journey on towards the GreatSwamp; where being arrived, they lay for ’eight or nine days, sometimes divertingthemselves in exercising the most atrociousand barbarous cruelties on their unhappyvictim, the old man. In vain, alas! were allhis tears, for daily did they tire themselveswith the various means they tried to tormenthim, sometimes tying him to a tree, andwhipping him; at others scorching his fur¬rowed cheeks with red hot coals, and burn¬ing his legs quite to the knees: but the goodold man, instead of repining, or wickedly15r arraigning the divine Justice, like manyli others in such cases, even in the greatest^agonies, incessantly offered up his prayers to/the Almighty with the most fervent thanks¬givings for his former mercies, and hopingi the flames then surrounding him, and slowlyconsuming his aged limbs, would soon sendshim to the blisstul mansions of the just, to befa partaker of the blessings there.One night after he bad been thus torment-? ed; whilst he and I were sitting together con-1 doling each other at the misfortunes andn miseries we daily suffered, twenty scalps and: three prisoners were brought in by anotheri party of Indians. They had unhappily fallenii into their hands in Cannocojigge, a smallI town near the river Susquehana, chiefly in-I habited by Irish people. These prisonersf gave us some shocking accounts of the miv-j (lets and devestations committed in their| parts!The various and romplicated actions ofi these barbarians would fili a whole volume;I but what 1 have already related, with a fewi other Instances which 1 will select from their' information, will enable the reader to guessi at the horrid treatment the'English, and In-i dians in their interest, suffered for many years| past.— 1 shail therefore only mention -in ai a brief rnanuer, those that suffered near thefsame time with myself.This party who now joined us, had itnot, 1 found, in their power to begin theirwickedness as soon as those who visitedmy habitation; the first of their tragediesbeing on the 25ih of October, 1754, whenJohn Lewis, with his wife and three smallchildren, fell sacrifices to their cruelty, andwere miserably scalped and murdered; hishouse, barn, and every thing he possessed,being burnt and destroyed.On the 28th, Jacob Miller, with his wifeand six of his family, together with everything on his plantation, underwent the sam#fate.The 30th the house, mill, barn, twentyhead of cattle, two teams of horses, and everything belongingtothe unhappy George Folke,met with the like treatment,; himself, wife, andall his miserable family, consisting of nine innumber, being inhumanly scalped, then catin pieces, and given to the swine, which- de¬voured them.I shall give another instance of the number¬less and unheard of barbarities they relatedof these savages, and proceed to their ownmost tragical end.One of the substantial traders belonging tothe Province, having business that called himup the country, fell into the hands of thesediabolical wretches, who not only scalped him,but immediately roasted him before he wasdead; then like cannibals for w ant of otherfood, ate his whole body, and of his headmade what they call an Indian pudding.The three prisoners that were brought withthese additional forces, constantly repining attheir lot, and almost dead with their exces¬sive hard treatment, contrived at last to maketheir escape; but being far from their ownsettlements, and not knowing the country,were soon after met by some others of thetribes or nations at war with us, and brought17Shock to their diabolical masters who greatlyrejoiced at having them again in their power.The poor creatures almost famished foriwant of sustenance, having had none duringthe time of their elopement, were no soonerin the clutches of the barbarians, than two of1) them were tied to a tree, and a great fire madei round them, where they, remained till theyIwere terribly scorched and burnt! when oneof the villains, with his scalping knife, riptopen their bellies, took out their entrails, andburnt them before their eyes, whilst the otherswere cutting, piercing, and tearing the flesh1 from their breasts, hands, arms, and legs,< with red-hot irons, till they were dead! Thei. third unhappy victim was reserved a few hourslonger, to be, if possible, sacrificed in a morecruel manner. His arms were tied close tohis body, and a hole being dug deep enought for him to stand upright, he was put therein,i and earth rammed and beat in all round his( body up to his neck, so that his, head onlyj appeared above ground; they then scalped(him, and there let him remain for three orI four hours, in the greatest agonies! after whichthey made a small fire near his head, causing( him to suffer the most excrutiating torments! imaginable, while the poor creature could only: cry for mercy in killing him immediately, for; his brains were boiling in his head! Incxho-rable to all his plaints, they continued the1 fire, whilst, shocking to behold! his eyesgushed out of their sockets! And such ago¬nizing torments did the unhappy creaturesuffer for near two hours till be was quitedead!A great sucw now falling the barbarians18were a little fearful, lest the white peopleshould, by theirtraces, find out their skulk¬ing retreats; which obliged them to make thebest of their way to the winter quarters, about200 mi'.es farther from any plantatiens or in¬habitants; where, after a long and tediousjourney, being almost starved, I arrived withthis infernal crew.The place we were to rest in their tongue,is called Alamingo There was found anumber of wigwams*, full of their womenand children. Dancing, singing, and shout¬ing, were their general amusements; and inall their festivals and dances, they relatewhat successes they have had, and what dam¬ages they have sustained in their expeditions;in which I became part of their theme. Theseverity of the cold increasing, they striptme of my clothes for their own use, and gaveme such as they usually wore themselves,which was a piece of blanket a pair mog-gans, or shoes, with a yard of coarse cloth,to pul round me, instead of breeches.Here was I kept near two mojiths, untilthe snow was off the ground. A long timeto be among gjtch creatures, and naked, as Ialmost was! However, I contrived to defendmyself against the inclemency of the weatheras well as I could, by making myself a littlewigwam with the bark of trees, covering it* Wigwams are the names they give theirhouses, which are no more than little huts,made with three or Jour Jorked stakes droveinto the ground, -and covered with Deer orother skins, or for want of them, with largeleaves and earth.19with earth, which made it resemble • cave;land, to prevent the ill effects of the cold,which penetrated into it, I "vas obliged tofreep a good firc'always near the door. Thusdid I, for near two months endure such hard-'ships of cold and hunger, as had hithertoibeen unknown to me.At length the time arrived for preparinganother expedition against the Planters, ami'white people; but before they set out theyiwerc joined by many other Indians from Fort!Du Quesne, well stored ^fith powder andball, which they had received from theFrench. ’ -As soon as the snow was quite gone, andno traces of their vile foot- steps could be per¬ceived, they set out on their journey towardsthe back parts of the Provinces of Pensylva-nia, leaving their wives and children behindin their wigwams. They were now a for¬midable and terrible body, amounting to •near 150. I was made to carry what theythought proper to load me with, but th^ynever entrusted me with a gun.When we came again to the Blue Hills,about 30 miles from Cannocojigge, the Irishsettlement befere mentioned, we encampedfor three days, though we had neither tents,i nor any thing else to defend us from the in¬clemency of the air, having nothing to lie onby night but the grass.During our stay here, a sort of Council ofWar was held, when it was agreed to dividethemselves into companies of about twentymen each. I still belonged to my old*0Masters, but was left behind en the moun¬tains with ten Indians to stay until the rest:should return; not thinking it proper to car¬ry me nearer the Cannocojigge, or the other'plantations.Here being left, I began to meditate myescape; and though I knew the country round▼ery well, having been often thereabouts withmy companions, hunting deerand other beasts,yet was I very cautious of giving ihe least sus¬picion of my intention. However, the thirdday after the granck body left us, my compa¬nions, or keepers, thought proper to visit themountains in search of game for their subsis¬tence, leaving me bound in such a mannerthat I could not escape. At night, when theyreturned, having unbound me, we all satdown together to supper on two pole-cats,being what they had killed, and soon after,(being greatly fatigued with their days excur¬sion) they composed themselves to rest, asusual. Observing them to be in that somni¬ferous state, I tried various ways to see whe¬ther it was a scheme favourable to my inten-tentions or not. After making a noise, andwalking about, sometimes touching themwith my feet, I found it a fit opportunity tomake the attempt.I resolved if possible, to get one of theirguns, and if discovered to die in my defence,rather than be taken; for that purpose, I madevarious attempts to get one from under theirheads (where they always secured them) butin vain. Frustrated in this my first essay to¬wards regaining my liberty. I dreaded thethoughts of carrying my design unto execu¬tion; yetafter a little consideration and trusting21rimyself to the divine protection I set forwardsHnakcd and defencless as I was. A rash andidangerous enterprise !H Such was my terror however that in goingifrom them. I halted and paused every four-Drfive yards looking fearfully towards the spotwhere I had left them, least the)' should awakeland miss me, but when I was about two hun¬dred yards from them, I mended ray pace,and made as much haste as I could tothe footofthe mountains; when on a sudden I was struckwith the greatest terror and amaze at hearingthe wood-cry as it is called ahdmay heexpres-ised Jo haul Jv haul which the savages I hadleft were making, accompanied with the mosthideous cries and bowlings they could uteriThey having now missed their chargesI concluded they would soon separate them¬selves and go in quest of me. The more myterror increased the faster did 1 push on, andscarce knowing where I trode drove throughthe woods with the utmost precipitation, some¬times falling and bruising myself, cutting myfeet and legs against the stones in a miserablemanner; but though faint and maimed I con¬tinued my flight until break of day, whenwithout having any thhigto sustain naturebuta little corn, I crept unto a hallow tree, ini which I lay very snug and returned ehanks toGod who had thus far favoured my escage.At night I ventured forwards again fright¬ened and trembling at every bush I passed,thinking each twig that touched me to bea sawage. The third day I concealed myselfin the like manner, and at night I travelled onin the same deplorable condition keeping offthe main road used by the Indians as much as22possible which made my journey many mileslonger. But how shall I describe tlte terrorI fell on the fourth night, when by the rust-'ling I made among the leaves,a party of Indians)that lay round a small fire which I did notperceive, started from the ground and seisingtheir arms, run from the fire ampngst thewoods. Whether to move forward dr to restwhere I was I kttew not, so distracted was myimagination. In this melancholy state,revolving in my thoughts the now inevitablefate of I thought waited on me, to mygreat consternation and joy, I was relievedby a parcel of swine passing; on seeingtbe hogs, they conjectured that their alarmwas occasioned by them ahd very merrilyreturned to the fire, and lay down to sleepas before. As soon as l perceived my enemiesso disposed of, with more cautious step andsilent tread I pursued my course, and reachedthe summit of a great hill with some difficulty;and looking out if I could spy any habitationsof white people to my unutterable joy I sawsome, which I guessed to be-about ten milesdistance. This pleasure was in some measureabated by my not being able to get amongthem that night; therefore, when evening ap¬proached, I again recommended myself tothe Almighty and composed my weary man¬gled limhs to rest. In the morning as soon asI awoke, I continued my journey towards thenearest cleared lands I had seen the day before,and about tour o’ clock in the afternoon ar¬rived at the house of one John Bell, an oldacquaintance where knocking at the door, bewho opened it seeing me in such a frightfulcondition flew from me like lightning andscreaming into the house. This alarmed the23j!ivholefatniIy,who immediately fled totheirarmsimd I was soon accosted by the master withtiisgunin his hand. But on my making my-Self known (for he before took me to be anIndian) he immediately caressed me as didIso his family with a deal of friendship, atinding me alive; they having all been inform¬'d of my being murdered by the savagestome months ago. They for two or threefights very affectionately supplied me withill nesesaiies and carefully attended me untilny spirits and limbs were pretty well recruitedyhen I borrowed of these good people (whoseicindness merits my most grateful return)> horse and some clothes and set forward forimy father-in-law’s house in Chester county,ibout 140 miles from thence where I arrivedan the 4th day of Jnnuary 1756 but scarce oneaf the familv could credit their eyes believing'with the people I had lately left that I had’alien a prey to the Indians.Great was the joy and satisfaction where-ith I was received and embraced by thehole family; but oh! what was my anguishhd trouble, when, on enquiring for my dearife, 1 found she had been dead near twoonths! This fatal news, as every humanereader must imagine, greatly lessenedthe joy and rapture I otherwise should havefelt at my deliverance ftom such a dreadfulstate and captivity.A short time after this exploit, I returnedto Philadelphia, where finding a Ship boundfor Scotland, I embarked; and after an easypassage, found myself in my native land.I went to Aberdeen and published thereI this account of my Life and Sufferings; but24the Magistrates not relishing the publicationof facts so little to their praise, seized on me,(and after deliberating how they should fright¬en me, ordered’my books to be burnt pub¬licly by the hangman, and banished me fronpithe town. I went to Edinburgh, and, rely¬ing bn the uprightness of my cause, raised a;Process against them before the Court ofSession: and after establishing my assertion?^against Kidnapping, by numerous evidences,,that Anpartial Court, which administers jus-<tice to the poor, and screens them complete-*ly from any overbearing of the rich, finedithose tyrannical Magistrates in One Hundred^Pounds Sterling, and also the expenses ohthe Suit.(-■mFINIS.•3If

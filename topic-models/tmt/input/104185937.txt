no more I’ll tread,No happy morn, to me forlorn,Can bring the happy scenes now fled.Thy glades and groves where pleasures rove,I bade a last adieu,When fortune’s star, my doom, by war,Resolv’d at Waterloo.No pleasure brings the blazing sun,Tho’ in the glow of day,Nor solemn night, star-spangl’d bright,Can drive my exile-grief away.Contention’s fate I've seen too late,And grandeur’s luring glare,So here my doom is endless gloom,With sullen, grim despair.No more again on hill or plainTo me shall ranks appear ;Nor blazing steel e’er more shall reel,In charge of bayonet or spear.7Keen ruin’s blast, my fate at last,Hath driv’n me far from joy,Fate, take my life, but spare my wife.And harmless, darling boy.JOCK O’ HAZELDEAN.“ Why weep ye by the tide, lady ?Why weep ye by the tide ?I’ll wed ye to my youngest son,And ye sail be his bride.And ye sail be his bride, lady,Sae comely to be seen —But aye she loot the tears down fa’For Jock o’ Hazeldean.“ Now let this wilful grief be done,And dry that cheek so pale ;Young Frank is chief of Errington,And lord of Langley dale.His step is first in peaceful ha’.His sword in battle keen —But aye she loot the tears down fa’For Jock o’ Hazeldean.> n >“ A chain of gold ye sail not lack,For braid to bind your hair,Nor mettled hound, nor managed hawk,Nor palfrey fresh and fair.And you the foremost o’ them a’Shall ride, our forest queen —But aye she loot the tears down fa’For Jock o’ Hazeldean.The kirk was decked at morning tide—The tapers glimmer’d fair—The priest and bridegroom wait the bride,And dame and knight are there.They sought her both by bower and ha’—The lady was not seen :—She’s o’er the Border and awaWi’ Jo<?k o’ Hazeldean.,no?

His very belly was a* sunburnt likea piper’s bag, ov the head of an auld drum,and yet his beard began to sprout out likeherring banes. He took thick brose to hisbreakfast, and baps and ale through the day;and when the coals selled dear, and the win’was cauld, bought an oven-farl, and twaDunbar Wadders, or a Glasgow Magistrate,which fish-wifes ca’s a wastlin herrin*.His mither, auld Mary, plaguad him ay inthe morning; she got up when the hens hec¬kled, riping the ribs, blew her snotterbox,primed her nose, kindled her tobacco-pipe,and at every puff breathed out fretting a-gainst her hard fortune and lanely singlelife. O but a widow be a poor name; but Ilive in a wilderness in this lang-lonen, monya ndan gaes by my door, but few folks looksin to poor Mary! Hoch hey, will I neverwin out of this wearied life. Wa Sawny,man, wilt thou no rise the day; the sun’s up,and a’ the niboars round about; Willie andCharlie is on the hill an hour syne, and halfgate hame again. Wilt thou rise an gie thebeasts a bite, thou minds na them, I wat man.Grump grump, quo Sawny, they got theirsupper an hour after l got mine. Shut todead come on them every ane an they geta bit frae me till they work for’t.sgawny. But mither I’ve been dreamingthat I was married, an’ in the bed abocn thebride; I wonder gin it be trae? Od, I ne’ergot sic fun: what will’t be, think ye ? Howauld am I mither? Do you think I couldman a hissy yet? fegs I have a mind to tryjbut the saucy hissies will na hae me, I kenweel enough.Mither. Say you lad, ay mony a hungryheart wad be blythe o’ you; but there wasnever a sca’d Jockey but there was a scab¬bed Jenny till him yet: dinna be scar’d ladeSawny. A hech, mither, I’se no be lordlyan’ I sud tak a beggar wife aff the hi’ gate;but I’ll tell ye something that I’m ay think¬ing on, but ye maun na tell the neighbours^for the chiels wad aye jaw me wi’t.Mither. Wad I tell o’ thee lad, I waitell o’ mysel as soon.Sawny. Do ye mind mither, that day 1gade to the Pans I came in by auld Mattie’syour countrywoman, the Fife wife, it cam’out o’ the town ye cam frae, the wife thatsays Be-go laddies, I gade there, an she wasunco kind, and made me fat brose out o’ thelee side o’ her kail-pot: there was baith beefand paunches in’t; od they smell’d like onyhaggis, and shined a’ like a gould fac’d waU-6#oat: fegs I suppit till I was like to riveo’themand had a rift o’ them the morn a* dayjwhen I came out I had a kite like a cow wi*calf; she spiered for you, mither, and I saidye was gaily} and she looked to me, and leugh,and gripped my shakle-bane, and said I wouldbe a sturdy fallow yet—I looked to her, andthought 1 liked her, and thinks on’t ayesince syne: she leugh, and bade me seek outa coal driver for her, for she didna like tocarry a fish creel.Mither. Forsooth, Sawny, I’ll gie my twalugs for a lav’rock’s egg if she binna in lovewi’ thee, and that will be a bargain.Sawny, An upon my word mither, shersa sturdy gimmer, well worth the smoakingafter} she has a dimple on every cheek, anhaunches like a sodjer’s lady’s hoop, theyhobble when she shakes, and her paps play^niddlety nod when she gangs; I ken by herkeckling she has a conceit of me.'Mither. But Sawny man, an thou see hermither Matty in the town, auld Be-go laddie,as you ca’ her, gie her a dram, she likes itweel; spout ye a mutchkin o’ molash in hercheek, ye’ll get her mind, and speed the bet¬ter.Sawny. But mither, how sud I do whenI gang to court her i will I kiss her, an'4(7kittle her, an fling her o'er as the chiels dtthe hissies among the hay; I’ve seen thengang - o’er ither, an* o’er ither, and wheithey grip them by the wame, they’d cry lika maukin when the dogs are worrying it.Hither. Hout awa, daft dog it thou is, that1no the gate; thou maun gang in wi’ bra*good manners, and something manfu’, pvion a Sunday’s face, and sigh as ye weresaint, sit down beside her, as ye wereMess John, keek aye till her now and thewi’ a stowen look, and haud your mouth ;■aim and grave as a May-puddock, orwhore at a christening; crack weel o’ otwealth, and hide our poverty.Sawny. Ay, but mither there is some ithtway in courting nor that, or the lassies wouina couple so close to them.Mither. Ay, but Sawny man there’stime for every thing, and that too; when ysit where naebody sees you, you may tak h<head in your oxter like a creesh pig; danebs wi’ her. now and then; but be sure y6keep a close mouth when you kiss her, claher cheeks and straik her paps, but for yoidrowning gang na farther down; but foul*that’s married can put their hand to okpart they like.Sawny. Aha, bat mither I didos ke8e first word o' courting, the lassie 'II aa:n what I’m coin’d about.Mither. Ay will she lad, wink and keekel to her, she’ll hae a guess, seek a quiet«rd o’ her at the door, and gin it be dark,? her a bit wee kiss when ye hae toll’d herar errand, and gin they gie you cheese and?ad, or ony meat, ca’t good whether it be• or no; and for my blessing be mensfu wi*ir mou,’ and dinna eat o’er tnuckle, for3 seen you sup as mony milk brose asd a sar’d twa men to carry in a barrow.!>awny. Aha, but mither you’re lying now,I never did it but ance,but an they set meatore me, an I be hungry, a de’il claw thengest an I binna upsides wi’t for the same.:eed mither, fouks maun hae meat an theyDuld ne’er get wives, ana there’s some o’:m no worth the cursing, an a body wernating an oath whether or no; a hear ye thatw, when ye put me till’t, and gar me speak,by my sooth, I wad ralher hae a bit goodwny and a pund o’ cheese, or I were boundbab after ony hissie’s buttocks I see yet.Mither. Wa Sawny man, thou’s a fool, anit’s a fault; gin every ane were as easy a-it women as thou is, the warld wad be a; derness in a wee time, there wad be nae! ly to inhabit the earth but brute beasts;s and dogs wad be worrying ither, and e-ij■asL9very thing wad gae to confusion. Gae to thecourting, ye dog ’t ye are, and either dosomething or naething at a’.PART II.got Sawny in the morning, and swal¬lowed owre sodded meat flag by flag}and aff he goes to the coals and the courtinglilting and singing like a lavrock in a Maymorning—O to be married if this be the way.The colliers wondered a’ to see him sae weelbuskit wi’ a pair o’ wally side aulti-fashionedleather breeks o’ his father s, an’ an auldcreeshy hat, mair like a frying pan than onything else; a lang cravat like a minister orBailUe Duff at a burial, a clean face and hands,and nae less than a gun-sleeved linen sark onihim, which made his cheeks to shine like asherney weight} and the colliers swore he uafas braw as a horse gaun to a cow’s dredgy.But Sawny came off wi’ his coals, whistling and whipping .up the poor beasts, e’en aoutrageous as ony ram at riding time} weemight ony body see there was a storm irSawny’s nose, light where it like} for no sooner had he selled his coals, than he left hi,horse to come hame wi a nibour callan, an'gad keekin up the Cowgate, and througthe closses, seeking auld Bergo, his guid-m'10tiier to be; then in through the fish-market,where he bought twa lang herrin, an’ twabaps, a pair of suter’s auld shoon, greasedblack and made new again, to make his feetfeasible like, as he kend the lass would look’ at them (for his mither tell’d him the wo¬men look’d ay to the men’s legs or theymarried them, and the weel-legged loonsgade ay best aff.)'1 So Sawny came swaggerin’ thro’ a the; shell wives, but she was na there; but com-! ing down the town below the guard he metauld Be-go justi’ the teeth, an she cries,Hay laddie my dow, how’s your mither ho¬nest Mary? Thank you, quo’ Sawny, she’s5 meat hale, aye working some—rhow’s a at( hame, is Kate and the laddie weel?Matty. Fu’ weel, my dow: ye’re a brawsonsy dog grown, a wallie fa’ me gin I kendye.Come,'come, quo’ Sawny, and I’ll gie ye aaossack to heat your wame, it is a cauld day^and ye’re my mither’s countrywoman.Na, fair fa’ you, Sawny, I’ll nae refus’t; adram’s better the day than a clap on the arsewi’ a cauld shule, sae follow me, my dow.So awa’she took me, quo’ Sawny, downdark stair, to ane o’ the how houses beneathihe yird, where it was mirk as in a coalijeugh, and they had a great fire. Sweet bevi’ me, quo Sawny, for it minds me o the:l part; an’ a muckle pot has a little ca*l*seethin kail and roasting flesh, the11•wife forked them out as fast as she could in¬to cogs an’taps, for there came in a wheensutor like fallows, wi’ black thumbs an’ cree-shy aprons, that cutted them a’ up in a weetime, but they ne’er fashed wi us, nor we withem; we first got a gill, and then got a hetpint. A vow, said I, Matty, is Kate gaun toget a man yet ?Matty. A man laddie! wha wad hae her?a muckle, lazy, useless jade) she can do nae-thing but work at husband work, card andspin, wash ladies rooms, and scour a gentle¬man’s bonny things: she canna tak’ a creelon her back, and apply to merchandizing asI do, to win a man’s bread.Sawny. I think some of the fishers andher might mak it up.Matty. A fisher, laddie ! haith, the fish¬ers wad rather hae a pickle good bait totheir hooks, and twa three bladders totheir lines, than put up wi’ the like o* her, astinking prideful jade, altho’ I bore her, ayscourin and washin at hersel, prickin andprinnin, keeps her face ay like a Flander’sbaby, and naeless than ribbons and rings, andher shoon made o* red clouts; a de’il stickpride, when our auld guidams ran barefoot,and our gutchers gade wi here hips. Gieher a man! ill thief stap a gouk in her arsefirst, that may cry cuckow when e’er shespeaks o t; she can do naething but scour la-dies pishpots, an’ keep clean the tirlie-wher-iies that hang about the fire; haith she’s oVgentle brought up to be a poor man’s penny¬worth.Heigh hov>, quo’ Sawnyj and ’tis e’en agreat pity, for she’s a weel-far’d lusty hissie;he.had a great kindness for her.Matty. A weil-a-wat she’s no lingletail’d,she may be a caff bed to a good fallow, butan thou had but seen me at her age, I was asturdy gimmer; there was nae a Hynd in aDubbyside could lay a ccrpen to a creel wime, the fint a fallow in a Fife but I wad alaid on the bread o his back, an’ a’ his gearuppermost, I was na a chicken to chatter wiindeed laddie, For I had a flank like an ox,an’ a pair o’ cheeks like a chapman’s arse.Sawny. Nae douts but ye had a pair o’beefy buttocks, for your very cheeks hingslike leather bags to this day, but I’ll tell youwhat I’m gaun, to tell you—do ye thinkthat your Kate wad tak me, an I wouldcome to court her?Matty. Tak you, laddie, tak you, a faithshe’ll tak you, for she would tane a poor but¬ton thing o’ a half blind tailor, wartna me,a poor, blind, bowiy, scabbit like creature-,I’ve seen the day I wad hae carried him inmy pouch. Wode I’se warrant her jump atyou, like a fish at a flee, wad I say tak you,and she winna tak you, I’se tak you mysel,but she an I cust out the day about her ccck-wps and black caps, gar’d me say muckle oher; but she’s my sonsy Jawty for a that;is .weel-a-wat she's a weel-natured lassie, andgin she turn an iilnatured wife I canna tell.Sawny.' A weel then I’ll venture on heras she is, for my mither’s pleased, an ye’repleased, an I’m pleased* wode I am sure toget her, an the taylor has nae bridled her*or tane a trying trot o’ her.Matty. But Sawny, man, I’ll tell you whatwe’ll do, I’!l bame and broach her the nighton’t, an come ye the morn, we’ll mak it fu*fast in a wee time, so thou’s get mair tocherthan a Cramon, gammon to gammon; shehas baith blankets and sheets, a covering,and twa cods o’ caff, a caff bed and bowster,and hviar’st thou, my laddie, I hae a b*t auldhogger, and something in’t, tbou’s get it Jwhen I die; but by my sooth it will be thelast thing that I’ll part wi’, I kenna what I ;may need yet—’tis an auld wife that ken$ iher ain weird.On this they paid their spout and parted;but when Sawhy came out, he stoited andstaggered like a sturdy stot: molash waschief commander, for Sawny thought everybody had twa heads and four een, and more,noscs than they needed, while in the darkhouse he sometiujes thought it was themorning of a new day: a hech, said he, whenwas I a night frae my mither before; she’llthink I am put in the guard, tane wi* theJeil or the doctors, or else married, andworking at the wanton trade o’ weans mak~ing.34Matty. Hute, daft laddie, the soup drink’sin your head, and gars ye think sae, thisday and yesterday is ae day: ye’ll be hame inbraw time yet.Sawny. A vrell, a well then, good dayto you, good mither: ye maun gar Kate takme, or thief tak you’ a thegither: I’ll hameand tell the length it’s come, and if it comesaae farther, it maun e’en stick there.Off he goes, tacking about like a ship a-gainst the wind, as if he would knock holes ‘in the wa’s and windows wi’ his elbows; helooked as fierce as a lion, with a red face likea trumpeter, and his nose was like a bubblyjock’s neb, as blue as a blawart: but or he wanhalf way hame his head turned heavier thanhU heels and mony a filthy fa’ he got, throughthick and thin he plashed, till hame he getsat last, grunting and gaping by the wall, whenauld Mary thought it was their nibours sow,he was sae bedaubed wi’ dirt; by the timeshe got him to bed, he was in a boiling-bar¬rel fever, and poor Mary grat wi’ grief.Sawny. Hech, hey! but courting be acurst wark, and costly too: an marriage be asmortifying and murdering, the deil may b«married for me.Mither. Wa Sawny, man, what’s comeo’er thoe now ? rhou hast gotten skaith, some>4isauld wife has witcht thee, or the deil hasdung thee o’er in some dirty middenj wherebast thou been, or what hast thou seen; thaeeen reel like a wild cat’s, and the sweat ishailing o’er thy nose; thou’s witcht, thou’switch’t, O man, what will I do.Bock, bock, gaed Sawney; but it could nawin up for bubbles an’ herrin banes. Oh, quo’he, keep me in my bed for my days will soonbe done; a curse on your courting wark, forit has killed me, and wives are but wickedthings, I ken by the same.Mithen O dole, dole, my bairn has got¬ten poison, for the smell o’ it is like to poi¬son me.Sawny. Gin herrin’" and het ale be poi¬son, there’ll no be mony left alive. Bock,bock, Oh, quo, Sawney the bed’s filed !1Mither. O my bairn, thou was ay a clean¬ly bairn till now; thou’s surely lost thy sen¬ses when thou files where thou lies, like th$brute beasts: thou ne’er did the like o’ this,before since thou left rocking o’ the cradle.10PART m."pOOR Sawny had a terrible night o’t, wi*a sair head and a eick heart, his e’en stoodin his head, his wame, caddied like ony cow’s-milks, and puddings crocket like a wheenpuddocks in a pool; his mither rocket andwrung her hands, crying, a wae be to thewife that brewed it, for I hae lost a weel fos¬ter’d bairn wi’ their stinking stuff; a meikledeil ding the doup out o* their caldron, mycurse come on them and their whisky-pots,it’s brunt him alive; ay, ay, my bairn he'sgone.But about the break of day, his wind braklike the bursting of a bladder, O happy de¬liverance, cried Mary his mither; tho’ dirtbodes luck, and foul farts file the blankets,I wish ne’er waur be among us. The nextthing that did Sawny good, wasthree mutch-kins of milk made into thin brose, and apickle fine pepper in them, yet he had asoughing in his lugs like a saw-mill, and c-very thing gade round about wi’ him a’ thatday; his mither gat him out of bed. an’ put,him in the muckle chair wi a*'pair of blanketsabout his shoulders, a cod -Jt his back, anda het brick to his soles, to gar him trow hewas nae well, and there he sat like a lying-inwife, cracking like a Holladdie, and ate twadead herrin’ and a crust, telling a the outs17ns about the bridal, and when it was to be,:or he had gotten every body’s consent but:he bride’s about it.Mither. But Sawny, man, that’s the maiaI thing! ye maun hae that too.Sawny. Na, na, mither, I’m the mainthing myself, aye she’s but a member; ihemen maun aye be foremost—gang what wayit will, 1’se aye be uppermost.Mither. But Sawny man, what way isthou gaun to do? will ye make a penny wed¬ding; or twa or three gude neebours, a pecko’ meal baken, wi’ a cheese and a barrel o’ale; will that d»?Sawny. Na na mither, I’ll take a cheap¬er gate nor ony o’ them; I’ll gar half-a-crownand half a mutchkin, or a rake o’ coals doit a’, then a body has nae mair to do butpiss and tumble into bed.Mither. Na na, my man Sawny, I haemony a time heard thy honest father say,that never a ane would do well that capstrid-ed the kirk or cuckold the minister.Sawny. A. tell nae me, mither, o* theminister, they’re aye for their ain end aswell as ither fouk, and if a poor beggar bodyhad'a bit wean to christen, the deil a beit'they-11 feike him o’t.Mither Hute awa man, there’s na body hasweans but what has siller to pay the christen¬ing o’ them; or if they be that poor, theysudna get nae weans, and they wadna befashed syne.18Sawny. Ha ha mither, the poor fouk,like the lice, ay when they meet they marry,and maks mae o’ them: and I think the micisters might christen their bits o* weans fornaething, the water's nortae scant; they areweel paid for their preaching, they may veryweel baith marry and -christen a’ the poorfouks into the bargain, by the way o’ amaggs.Mither. Ay, ay, my man Sawny, mar*riage is a sweet thing for young fouk, andthe bed undefiled..Sawny. What the vengeance, mither, doye think that a body is to file the bed everynight because they did it ance.Mither. Na, na, that’s no what I meanit U the happiness that fouk hae that’s mar>ried, beside the wearied lonesome life that 1hae, lying tumbling and gaunting in a bedmy lane: O sirs, but a man in bed be ausefu’ body, an it were but to claw ane’s back,as for a body’sibreside, they can claw it them,selves. - :Sawny. Ah mither, mither, ye hae funastring again; I think ye might a wanted a’your days, when ye bae wanted sae lang: yehave plenty o’ baith milk and meal, snuffand tobacco; but ye smell at the crack o’ thewhip, I kend my mither wad ride yet, forI’ve seen her fit waggan this lang time.Mither. A dear Sawny man, an thouwere ance fairly aff the fodder, J 11 be cast'into a hole o’ house by mysel, where 111I19just lye and break my heart, and weary my-self to death; but an I could get a bit honestweaver, a cobler, or some auld tailor by thetail, I wouid tackle to him yet, let the coun¬try clash as they please about it.Sawny. A well, a well mither, tak yourain flight, there’s nae fool like an auld fool;for the morn I’ll be aff or on wi’ the hissieI hae in hand.So on the morrow Sawny got a’ his claisegleaned, his hair kamed and greased wi’ but¬ter, and his face as clean as if the cat hadticket it, and away he goes singing:I will buy a pound o’ woo',1 will wash’t and mak a plaidy,I’m gaun o’er the muir to woo,Carlin, is your daughter ready.Now poor Sawny, although he sang, hewas as pale as a ghost fromthe grave; his facewas whitly white, like a weel-bleach’d dish-clout, and he looked as if he’d been eatenand spued again; but at length he came tothe bride’s door, and in he goes wi’ a brattle,crying. How’s a’ here the day? and what’scorned o’ thy mither, lassie? O Saunders,said the bride, she’s awa to the town: whatcame o’ ye yesterday, she waited on you thewhole day, ye gart her lose a day’s trade lad,?«nd she’s awa this morning cursing like aheathen, and swearing Be-go that ye haegien her the begunk.20Sawny. A dole woman, I took a saddest, blast in the hame gaun, and was never sacnear dead in my life.And wha think you was in company wi*Kate the bride, but the wee button of a tai¬lor, who sat and. sewed on a table, cockinglike a t—d on a trencher; but when he kentwha was come, he leaped down on the floor,cooat a dash o’ pride like a little bit prince,bobbet about, and so out he goes, with thetear in his eye, and his tail between his feet,like a half worried dogSawny. Now, Katie, do ye ken what Fnacorned about?Kate. O yes, my mither tell’d me: butI’m no ready yet, I hae twa gowns to spinand things to make.Sawny. Hute, things to mak, ye hae asmony things as ye’ll need, woman; canna yespin gowns in your ain house wi’ me, as weelas here, wi’ an auld girning mither?Kate. But dear Saunders, ye maun giea body time to think on’t—’twadbe ill-far’dto rush thegither just at the first.Sawny And do ye think I hae naethingado but come he>e every ither day hoitingafter you, it will no do! I maun be either affor on wi’ you, either tak me or tell me, forI ken of ither twa, and some o’ you I’ll hae,for as I’m a sinner, my mither is gaun tobe married too, an she can get cny bit mano’ ony shape or trade.Kate. Indeed, then, Saunders, since,2iyou’re in such haste, ye maun e’en tak theaithat’s readiest, for Fm not ready yet.Sawny. Dear woman, when your mitherand my mither’s pleased, and I am willing toventure on ye, what a sorrow ails you?Kate. Na, na, I’ll think on’t twa or threedays; its o’er lang a term to see without athought.Sawny. Wode I think ye’re a camstreriepiece o’ stuff; its true enough what your mi¬ther said o’ ye, that ye’re no for a poor man.Kate. And what mair said she o’ me?Sawny. Wode, she said ye could do nae-thing but wash mugs, and scour gentlemen’sbonny things; but hissies that is bred amanggentle houses, minds me o’ my mither’s cat;but ye’re far costlier to keep, for the catwastes neither sape nor water, but spits in.her loof, and washes her ain face, and wheenso’ you can do nae it her thing; and up hegets.Kate. O Saunders, but ye be short, canye no stay till my mither come hame?Sawny. I’ve staid lang enough for onything I’m to be the better; and Fm nae saeshort as your totum of a tailor, that I couldstap in my shoe, sae could I e’en.Hame he goes in a passion, and to hisbed he ran, crying, O death! death! I thoughtthe jade wad a jumped at me: no comfort norhappiness mair for me. O mither, gae bakemy burial bread, for I’ll die this night, or soonthe morn. But early next morning in comes22auld Be-go his guid mither, wha had lefther daughter in tears for slighting o’ Sawny,and hauls him and his mither awa’ to get adinner o’ dead fish; where a’ was agreed up¬on, and the wedding to be upon Wednesday,no bridal fouks but the twa mithers, andthemselves twa.So according to appointment, they met atEdinburgh, where Sawny got the cheappriest, who gave them twa three words, andtwa three lines, took their penny and a guiddrink, wished them joy, and gade his wa’s.Now, said auld Be-go, if that be your minis¬ter, he’s but a drunken b—h; mony a anedrinks up a*, but he leaves naething; he’s gotthe penny for diel a hate, ye might cracketluses on’t, tane ane anither’s word, a kiss anda hoddle at a hillock side, and been as weel,if no better: I hae seen some honest man saymair o’er their brose nor what he said a’ thegither; but an ye be pleased. I’m pleased; about in the bed ends a’, and makes surewark—so here's to you, and joy to the bar¬gain——its ended now, weel I wat.The Sinners and the Skulls,A TALE,Bt PETER PINDAR.A pair of youths, too fond of missing.That is, of one sad crime call’d kbsing,Could never let the girls alone.For ever busy with their lips Of Adam’s block two nice young chips,As good for love as e’er was known.To expiate these kbsing crimes.Committed, Lord, a thousand times,The Priest enjoin’d them penance twentynights Each in his bed a human skull.Cheek by jowl.To try what good might be perform’d byfrights.In a few days the Sinners met—* Pierre, wasn’t thee in a dev’lbh sweat.24To sleep so near a c—d old stinking head,My senses all were nearly lostjI dreamt of nothing but a ghost;Lord, I thought J should have died withdread.Well, was not thine a dismal sight?How did thy spirits bear the fright?Why, very pleasantly, faith, (answer’dPierre):So far from seeing ghosts and hell,I ne’er lik’d penance half so well;And yet the head was all night at my ear.“ Why, how the deuce is this?

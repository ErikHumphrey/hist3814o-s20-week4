My mother’s afflic-A2 ti»i\( 4 )ffan'had such an effect on her constitution*that she was seized with the pains of child;-bed! and, hut for the'assistance of an oldmaid-servant, she and the .innocent fruit ofher *vomb might hat'e fallen victims to hisiphumanitvv She was carried up to a gar; et,where she was delivered of a man-child ; theptory of whose unfortunate birth he himselfpow relates. My father being infwrmfed ofwhat had happened, fiew to her, m.d couldnot help shedding a flood of tears on behold¬ing the dear partner of his heart laid in amiserable apartment unfit to protect herfrom the inclemency of the weather, Theold gentleman was not ignorant of what hadpassed, thouglr he affected to be much sur¬prised when he heard it; and gave orderspile should immediately be gone Her wantof necessaries wjiere she,lodged, and griefend anxiety of mind, soon put an end to herlite My father was so affected with herdeath, that he remained six weeks deprived#f his senses; at which timfe'the inf»nt %asCarried to the old roan, who relented so far,on hearing the mcjgncltoly story of ptymothers death that he sent the child tonurse, and ordered ray father home to hisbouse, where he soon recovered the use ofbis reason, but was so exasperated at thebarbarity of his «ire, that he soon after dis¬appeared, and, notwithstanding all imag.n-abtc enquiry, could never be heard of, whichmaid\ C s ). ^ .! made most people think lie had made awayi \vith himself in a fit of despair.

Theyt made him welcome to be witness of thisj! ceremony, which was immediately performedto Ins satisfaction. Bnt the reader can scarceconceive the astonishment that app*. artfd,'when the day came, and an attorney pro¬nounced the1’young squire sole heir of hisgrandfather's estate, personal atfd reitl.—My uncle, who had listened with gre-.t at¬tention. accompanied the w'bfds of the at-Itorney with a stare, broke out in cursesagainst the deceased, and departed. In ourway to the village, niv uncle plesircd me notto be cast down, telling me 1 .should go tosea with him. Though this did not suit iviyiaatdmation, I was afraid ef ’discovering raya\v.r-(I*). *x ' • • *aversion to it, lest I should disoblige the 1♦nly friend 1 had in the world. But thisresolution was soon dropt, at the advice of«vi' us’>;r, who assured Mr. Bowling, it tvould. be a'thousand pities to baulk my genius,which would certam.y, o ^ day, make myfortune on shore. Upon which, this gene¬rous tar^determined to give me universityeducation ; and accordingly settled my board,and other expences, at a town not manymiles distant, famous for its cotttges, whither •We repaired, in a short time. But before ithe day of our departure, the schoolmasterLaid aside .all decency and restraint^ andabused me in the grossest - language, as awieKed, profligate, dull, beggarly, miscreant,whom he had taught through charity. This jbrutal behaviour made me think it high timeto be revenged of this insolent pedagogue.Having consulted my. adherents, I found ,tii in all staunch in their promises tp stand*by me; and \v^ formed a scheme, which wasas follows: .In the afternoon preceding thed '-v of our departure for the university, I was“to fake the advantage of the ushers goingwut to irTake water, and shut the great door,that lie might not come to the assistance ofirs superior. This being done, the assault!w;;r'io b * begun by my. spitting in the master’sfoce; {'was to be &?conded by two of tliesfrohges- hoys in the school, ■and we were todrag him to a bench, over which h© was■(II)to be laid, nnd heartily viliipt with’ his ow*birch. The other boys were ready to join ps,or hinder any one from coming to h s rel'of.One of our principal assistants ’ wi,.» calledJeremy Gawky, whos-1 life 1 iiad one* sdv> i,whenjie was on the.p«|«nt of being drowned ;'and the name of the other Hugh Scrap, whoseattachment flowed from a voluntary, disin¬terested inclination, which was manifestedon many occasions in my behalf, having otte«fathered offences I had committed, and hadetved me fro m drowning at the risk'of hi«own life. These two champions were willingto engage in this enterprise, as they intendedto leave the school next day, as well as I ;the first being ordered by bis father to return *into the country, and the other being bound* apprentice to a barber,, at a market-town notfar off.In the mean time, my uncle being informedof my master's behaviour to me, was enragedbeyond aM composition, and vowed revengeSo heartily, that I could not refrain fromtelling him the scheme I had concerted: buthe, doubting our abilities, consented to assistus. We were very proud of our associate,who/prepared a cat-and-mne-tails with greatexpedition; after wheih, he ordered ourbaggage to be packed up, and got horsesreauy 11 be mounted as so®n 'as the affair• Should be ever.At/(s* )At length the hour arrived, whoa aut'Auxiliary seized the opportunity of theusher's absence, bolted and secured the door*and immediately laid hold of-the pedant by •his collar, who bawled oat,1 murder, thieves 1’with the voice of a Stouter. I’iio’ I trembledall over,, I knew the;£ was no time to be lo.--f,and accordingly got up and sd.nmoned oarassociates to my assistance : Strap without 3%any hesitation, obeyed tiie signal, and seeingme lean upon the master’s bark, ran imme¬diately t£ one of his legs which pulling with {all Ids force, this dreadful adversary was soon |humbled to the ground : upon which Gau ky,who liad hitherto remained an hts place, I-hastened to thg scene of action and imuhed 4the fhllen tyrant with a loud huzza, in whichtUo vvhole schopkjoined. We soon dragged i:the oH hinal to a. post,'to which Bowling tied *liim witii a roptl he had provided oti purpose;af'ter having fastened hjs hands behind his *back, pulled down h';s breeches, .knd tucked iup his garments and shirt,, as fgr as theywould go, my unde, having upbraided tbi$arbitrary wretch with his-lnlmnaftdy tp me,told him that he proposed to give him a little.discipline for the good of hjs soul-; which he "immediately put in practice wivb great vigour .and dexterity^ This smart application tothe pedant’s• withered posteriors, gave him jsuch exquisite.pain, that he roared like anud bull, danced, cursed, and blasphemed.This( r3 )I This ceremony was no sooner over, than myuncle proposed they should leave the school,and convoy their old comrade Rovy to a pub-; lic-hous#" about a mile from the village,i where he would treat them ail. This offeri being joyfully embraced, he dismissed thehoys, and locking the door, left the precep¬tor to console himself, while we moved for¬wards .on our journey, attended by a numer-i ous retinue, whom he treated according tohis promise. We parted 'With many tears,)and lay that night at an inn on the road,about ten miles ort of the town where I1 was to reside, at which we arrived next day,j and was boarded at the house of an apothe-i nary, who had married a distant relation ofimy mother. In a few day , after, my uncleset out far his ship, after having settled thenecerary funds for my maintenance andeducation.I now began to.consider my precarioussituation; that I was utterly abondoned bythose whose duty it was to protect me; andthat my sole depeudance was on the genero¬sity of one man, who was exposed by hisI profession, to continual dangers, which mightone day deprive me of him for ever, i re¬solved to apply myseii with great care to mystudies, and enjoy the opportunity in my power:'in the space of three years I understood Greekvery well, was pretty far advanced in the mar$cniatiu3, aad no stranger to moral and na-B turil( 14 )turalplulosonhy: logic I mac'tabut' ah«ve'all t’afni’s f' va1u.;'dno a-Courit of'but' above'dll tilings J vkiuvd'mvseiF bn my'taste in. the Sfirl ft ’talent forpoetry.f?oi’ tlie moslt' coiVsjicF^'ihi’t pebblelius i reinafhed In sjocjtl iteW&tionfpr sometimel3 wHtnToilfe dat.'/on gbihg hodieto tllnifer, 7 was ihlorniefi tliere^ivis Vlblter1^Ml/WtucS sai>T tfi'ai Htf.%fiik* captain ja a (tael for wfiicfi H£f\v;;flaaintancem Sfawr?.' ^.‘l niiv: ge-f? tiinner, I was nilormea tliere“ifrom my uncle, vtliicfi sajcf tiiai He'luitt kflliida? o’olig-(J^fo feavgTflie. smp ana g.,that He hoped t‘> b * r‘estt>t'eil in d littleship' ahtl go 'bjiAelr to iVarice;time** * ft However affected’ tli'e iapbthecdry isuch a mahber'. tliatlie ghvb mfe J‘ b'uliileVsfaiid■-A i ' f>T I ir* Iv'ri w t-tt * _ * • ^ .TPja?hat t miuntJprdvide rfty^elf AHtH ’ anbihfrlod.-I'l. <>'«'• .if a'-jtaj :.i.: IThe indi.cnatiori wlnC!i'‘ t'Vii- ihs|iire(l»ave me Spirits tf;‘ ..

In this manner| I lived, without hearing the least tidings of1 rhy uncle, for the space of two years, duringfjj Which.,time I kept little or no company; for|:| the nabob, my master, allowed me no wages,(and the small perquisites of my station scarcesupplied me with the common necessaries oflife. My present appearance was ti e hast1 of my care, which was wholly ingfossed inlaying up a stock of instruction, that mightsecure me against the caprice of for'une forthe future. When- I: deer\,.d myself, suffi¬ciently master of my business, I began tok cast about for an opportunity of launchinginto the world ; but as this could not be ef- ,fected without asmail' sum of money to equipme for the held, 1 was in the utmost per¬plexity how to raise it, well knowing that■ Crab, for his own sake, would never put mein s. condition to leave him ; but a small, ac¬cident which happened about this time, de-.Itermined him in my favour. This was n«*other than the pregnancy of his maid-servant^Who-declared her situation tome, assuringihe, at the same time, that I was the occasionoPit. Although I had no reason to questionthe truth of this imputation, I was not igno¬rant of the familiarities which had passedbetween her master and her; of which avail-13 3 ingmg myself I represented to her the folly oflaying the burden at my door, when shemight dispose of it to much greater advan¬tage with Mr. Crab. She listened to myadvice, and next day acquainted him withthe pretended. success their mutual em- |jdeavours He was far from being overjoyedat this proof of his vigour, which he fdresawmight have very troublesome consequences,because he knew it would furnish his rival,Potion, with a handle for insulting and un¬dermining his reputation. It was not longbefore I guessed the result ol his deliberation,by his •'dressing himself to me one day intlifrfollowing manner: “ I am surprised thata young fellow ifke you discovers no. inclina¬tion to push his fortune in the world. What’s.hinder you from profiting by the war,which will certainly be declared in a shorttime against Spain-h You may easily get onboard a l ing’s ship, in quality of a surgeon’s * Hmate, where you wiil certainly see a greatdeal of practice, and stand a good chance ofgetting prize-money.” I laid- hold of thisdeclaration, which I had long wished for,and assured him I would follow his advicewith pleasure, if it was in my power. He toldme. that few necessaries were required ; andas for the expence of r..y journey, he wouldlend me money. I gave him a thousandthanks for his obliging offer, although I wast-ery well apprized of his motive, which was( I* )V •\o make bis chanibei maui lay the child to w'frafter 1 wa gone; and, accordingly, I set outin a few-weeks lor .London; iny .whole for¬tune consisting of one suit of clothes, half-a-dozen ruffled shirts, and as many plain;£wo pair of worstedostockings. and as manythread; a case of pocket instruments, a smalledition of Horace, Wiseman’s Surgery,^andten guineas in cash; for which Crab took'rny bond, bearing five per cent interest;at the same time, giving me a letter to themen;her of Parliament for our town, whichhe said would dd my business.

Accord¬ingly, I got a handsome binb for Which 1 paidfifteen shillings; ifnd returned to,our lodging,where sffp so do rid me of that hair whichid give* the schoolmaster so much dflence.We got up next day betimes, being in¬formed that Mr. Cringer gave audience bycandle-light to ali h^dependants, he himselfbeing obliged to attend the levefe of LordTerrier at break of day, because Vs lordshipmade one at the ndnistdr’s between eight andnine o’clock. When we came to Mr. Cringer’sdoor,'Strap, to give nfd art ipfetance .of hispoliteness, run tdfthe kVfock'er, which lie em¬ployed so loud and so iong, that he alarmedC>e whole stfeetg’mnd a \Vindow opening o*»C 3 two• V 30 )two pair o/ stairs in ti:e next hotiso, a cfiam*bor-pot was discharged upon him so success-that tJn' poor harber was wet to the skin;while I. beinglutkily at some distance, escapedthe unsavoury deluge. In the mean time, afootman opening the door, asked, with a sterncountenance, if it was I who made such adamn’d noise, and what I wanted ?• I told himI had business with his master, whom I de¬sired to see. Upon which he clapt the d*orIn my far?, telling me, I must learn bettermanners before 1. could have access to hismaster. Vexed at this disappointment, IiurnecV my resentment against Strap, whomI sharp y reprimanded for his presumption ; 'but he not in the least regarding A hat I said,wrung the urine out of his wig, and lifting uplarge stone,-flung it with such force againstthe street door of that hous • from whence hebad been bedewed, that the lock give way,i* flew open and he took to his" heels, leaving**mo to follow him as l -eouid: 1 therefore.pursued him with all the speed I could exert,until we found ourselves about the dawn, ina street we did not know. Here, as wewandered alsng, gaping'about, a very decent*nort of a man past-ing by me, stopped ofa sudden, and took up something, awhichhaving examined, he turned and presented itto me with these words, “ Sir, you havedropftndf-n-crown.” I told him. it did notbeising to me; but ha bid me r*collect, and.pee( 3* )feee if all my money was snfo; upon whicSjI pulled out my purse and reckoning my'money, in my hand, I assured htm. I had lost,nothing. “ Well then, says he, sH much thebetter this is God's-send; and as you twowere present when I picked it up, you araentitled to equal shares with me.” But we.absolutely refused any part of the sum.—‘ Come, gentlemen, said, he, you are toomodest; but yoy shall^give me leave to treatyou with a wet this cold raw morning.”—•I Tyould ha^e declined this invitation, butStrap whispered to me, that the gentlemanwould be affronted, and I complied. Weperceived a public-house, which we entered,and found a man sitting with a pint of purlbefore him. Our'new-acquaintance asked usif ever we had drank egg-flip? To which weanswering in the negative, he assured us ofa regale, and ordered a quart lo be prepared,calling for pipes and tobacco at the same time.We found this very palatable, and drankheartily: the conversation, which wras intro-,duced by the gentlemanf turned upon thesnares that young unexperienced people areexposed to in this metropolis. After we hadput the cann,about for •some time, our newfriend began to yawn, telling us, he had beenup all night with a sick person ; and proposedwe should have recourse to some diversion,to keep him awake. Although I had no greatinclination for gaming, I felt no aversion topasa( 3* }ati hour tfr two at cards with a frictri;ah'd knowing tliat Strap understood as inuch®f the matter as I. made no scruple of saving,I wash we could find a fourth hand; upoftWhich the person we found at our entrance,eftered to join us for a trifle. We acceptedhis proffer, aiid it fell to my lot to play againstStrap, for threepence a-garrie. We were sosuccessful, that in a short, time I was half-a-etown gainer, when the gentleman proposed•hanging partners. Inflamed with my goodfortune, 1 consented to give him satisfaction."Now, Strap and I being partners, they doubled-the stakes ;• and we continued so 'successful,that iu a short time we got thirty Shillings oftheir money. At last we lost ail our gains,.and about forty shillings of our own mbney.This mortified me extremely, and had a visi¬ble effect on Strap’s face, which lengthenedapace; but our antagonist kindly gave usan opportunity to retrieve our loss. Thislastxcontest ended in less than an hour, to myinexpressible affliction, who lost every shillingof my own, Strap absolutely refusing to sup¬ply me with a sixpence. The reckoning cameto eighteen pence, which having discharged,the gentleman shook us both by the hand,and saying, he should be very glad fo see usagain, departed, in the way to our lodging,after a profound silence on both sides," Strap,with a hideous groan, said, “ Wre have brought■oar nigs.to a fine market; Cod send us well• •1 * < .Clit( 31 }tmt of this ^..nce: We not horn i*London eightratul>Tf«rtyJaovi.i«W; and I believewc have met nitb eigbi a^^rCort.Y tbousandmb fortune^’ \V^ sopn. arriMed at our lodgvwhere, i»,ap. agony gf despair, I threvnn reli jntohed. refphing fccvperish for Vv-ant,rather tjianiapply .to,Strap or Any «Wfor re-'lief; butliefcame.to inv bed-sideband puttinga leather purse into my ,hsmd.j burst into tears,cry'hgvH know what you itbipk ; but4 scorayour thoug'us,: thtrp’s alt I have in the world,take, it, and I Jt,perhap$ get paore for you.before (that's, donp; and. if not, HI beg foeyou, gq through the worldvwith you,..andstarve with you/’ I was ao touched withhis generous passion, that I could not refraia .weeping.

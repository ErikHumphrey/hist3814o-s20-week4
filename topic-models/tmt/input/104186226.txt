rest! thou art v/eary andworn,I And fain was the war-broken soldier to stay;llut sorrow return’d with the dawning of morn,| And the voice in my dreaming ear meltedaway.THE MAID OF LODI.I SING the Maid of Lodi,Who sweetly sung to me,l.Vhose brows were never cloudy,Nor e’er distort with glee;:»he values not the wealthy,Unless they’re great and good.For she is strong and healthy,And by labour earns her food.itnd when her day’s work’s over.Around a cheerful fine'he sings or rests contented,W hat more can man desire !Let those who squander millions,Review her happy lor,They’ll find their proud pavilionsFar inferior to her cot.Between the Po and ParmaSome villains seiz’d my coach.And dragg’d me to a cavern,Most dreadful to approach.By which the Maid of LodiCame trotting from the fair ;She paus’d to hear my wailings,And sees me tear my hair.Then to her market basketShe tied her poney’s rein,I thus by female courageWas dragg’d to life again !She led me to her dwelling,She cheer’d my heart with wineAnd then she deck’d a table,at w’hicli the gods might dine.Among the mild MadonasHer features you may find,But not the fam’d Corregio’s. Could ever paint her mind.Then sing the Maid of Lodi,Who sweetly sung to me ;And when the maid is married.Still happier may she be.

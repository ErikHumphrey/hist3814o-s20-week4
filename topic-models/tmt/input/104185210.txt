When his triumphant. chariot had passed her, he could not but turn hiseyes back to behold her; and, like the love sickson to his fair Lancothe, was loth to go out of hersight; he thought once or twice to order his atten¬dants to enquire who she was, but then otherthoughts countermanded them, when he consideredthat his fame and glory would be eclipsed, if, justreturned from the wars of Mars, ho should be sus¬pected to incline to the soft tents of Venus ; so thatwithout any inquiry, coming to the sea-side, he5embarked his army on board the ships which layready to transport him into Greece, when settingsail with a fair wind, whilst Neptune and his Tri¬tons danced before him, he at length reached thejoyful shores, filled with the people from all partswho came to welcome him with music, songs, &c.,and thronged after him to his palace of Abides,where his father and mother with open arms re¬ceived him, and all the states of Greece came tocongratulate his success, proclaiming aloud his vic¬tories, and held ten day’s festival in their capitalcities, in honour of his brave exploits and achieve¬ments over so many nations.Leander, during the general rejoicing, was verythoughtful in disposing his army, and settling hisaffairs, which being done, he thought to betakehimself to repose after the tedious toil of war, butbeauteous Hero opposed it; he thought she wasalways in his sight, for sleeping or waking his fancyand all her dreams represented her unto him alllovely and charming, so that he could no longerstifle his flame, but signally showed by the altera¬tion of his countenance, that something inwardlydisturbed him ; his parents and friends wonderingat so sudden a change, and not knowing the cause,urged him to discover it, but he, being very pru¬dent, put them off- with fictions.While Leander was at this pass, the fair Herono less surprised at the sight of him represented toherself all that was great and worthy to be admiredin mankind, in him, so that their flames and pas¬sions were equal: though either was ignorant of it,she was so taken up with the thoughts of him, thatit deprived her of her natural rest, and was pleasedwith nothing more than to hear of the great actioushe had done, the relation of which was music to6her ears, and joy to her heart, and often she wouldask Amorissa, her nurse, who had brought her up,in whom she alone confided, what she had heardof the famous Grecian captain since he had passedthe sea? This woman being of a ready and quickunderstanding, found by the young lady’s oftenchanging colour, and sometimes hearing a sighescape when she spoke of Leander, that she iiadmore than ordinary concern for him, resolving todive more deeply into her thoughts, she urged hermany times to know why she so earnestly enquiredinto the fame and welfare of his person above allothers ? But she answered either with silence, orthat she did no more in that than every body didof so bravo a man : but one night Amorissa beingto watch in the chamber of the fair Hero, whosoinward fire had, by burning too fierce, somewhatdistempered her health, she heard her in her slum¬ber cry out, Oh ! how cruel is the god of love to aninnocent virgin to give such a sorrowf ul wound with¬out hope of cure ? She had scarce said this, whenshe fancied in her dream, as she afterwards de¬clared, she beheld Leander standing by her in amost lovely and charming shape, and the goddessVenus, as it were, presenting her with these words.Behold, fair maid, what you desire,His breast I’ve fill’d with equal fire,Both shall enjoy what either craves,Till love is quench’d in Neptune’s waves.Having thus said, Leander seemed to embraceher and she him, very tenderly and with ardentaffection, when a great sea of water seemed to flowinto the place on a sudden, and parted them ; atwhich she started, between sleep and wake cried atin a fright, 0 my Leander! my love, how or where7have I lost you ? and so awoke with rosy blusheson her cheeks, and teEtrs in her eyes, and beingtold of this by Araorissa, she could no longer denyher love, whereupon she promised her best assist¬ance, which she faithfully performed, as will here*after appear.CHAP. II.How Lcander passed the sea to prosecute his love with Hero, andby what means he delivered her and her father from death, andslow a great number of their enemies that had beset them in awood, with other particulars.Love having thus gained a double conquest, andboth the lovers ignorant of each other’s passion,Leaiyler grew impatient, forming in his mind manyschemes how he might come to the speech of his fairHero, whose image had made so deep an impressionon his heart. At length he resolved to pass over intoAsia as a private person, to wait there a while for afavourable opportunity of seeing his beloved. Hecould see her castle from the shore of Europe, andoften walked thither for that purpose. Going oneday as usual, and finding a small bark in a privateharbour between two rocks, he, without the know¬ledge of any one, agreed with the master to tran¬sport him to the farther shore, which he did witha favourable gale, and landed him by the side of aforest, some distance from Sestus, the castle of hisbeloved Hero, and having dismissed the master ofthe bark with a reward suitable to his labour, heset him down to consider the best method to betaken without giving offence.He had not been there long before he heard dis¬mal cries as of people in distress, and presently aman all bloody and wounded came running. out of8the forest, whereupon mounting his horse which hehad brought with him, he came up to the miserableperson, and demanding who had misused him ? towhom, with a faint voice he replied, certain pirateslying in ambush in the forest, had set upon princeArmelious and his train, and had killed many of'hem, yet those that remained valiantly defendedheir prince, therefore, for goodness-sake, said heo Leander, if you are generous, hasten to their as¬sistance ere it is too late.Leander, who had always a noble soul, and tookgreat delight to relieve the distressed, needed notto be incited to such an enterprise, set spurs to hishorse, being directed to the place by the continuedcries, and found the prince, most of whoso menwere slain, valiantly defending himself, hi» backbeing to a tree, against nine or ten of the villains :he easily perceived who the oppressors were, andflying in amongst them like a tempest, beat alldown before him, cutting off the heads of some,and the arms of others as they were about to strike,making their swords drop useless from their hands ;this put new courage into Armelious and his wound¬ed men, who yet survived their fellows, so thatlustily laying about them, all but three of thesepirates were slain, who, being likewise wounded,escaped among the trees ; Armelious had scarcetime to thank the generous Leander, when hearingthe cries of his daughter, whom others of this routwere carrying away prisoner, he besought him onhis knees to bend his course to her assistance.Leander now all covered with the blood of his ene¬mies, turned his horse to the path, followed thecry, and soon overtook them ; but oh ! how aston¬ished was he, when he saw, and knew the lady,though in tears and disordered, to be the beauteous!)Hero, lie lifted up Ins hands to heaven for direct¬ing him to this forest, at a time when the fairest ofcreatures was in danger, and being excited by loveand revenge, fell upon them like a thunderboltbreaking from a cloud, dying afresh his sword, notdried from the former blood, at which the trem¬bling lady died away to see such fatal strokes,which at every blow brought death to one or otherof them, so that despairing to carry off their preciousprize, when defended by one whom they supposedto be much more than man, those that could, fled,and those that could not, left their lives behindthem.By this time Armelious and his company werecome to lend what assistance they could, and see¬ing fair Hero rescued, they would have fallen atthe feet of their deliverer, but he generously with¬held them from doing it, alledging that he haddone nothing but what all good and just men oughtto hazard in such cases, to rescue the oppressed,and punish the oppressor; by this time the alarmbeing taken, a great crowd of people came flockingfrom the neighbouring parts, with such weapons ascame to their hands, and hearing what wondersthis stranger had done, and that it was to lusvalour alone they owed the safety of their princeand his fair daughter, they saluted him with shoutsof joy, but his thoughts were so perplexed for Hera„that he little regarded their applauses, for she, hy>the fright, and seeing so much blood shed, wasfallen into a swoon, but reviving at length, she wasput into a chariot that stood by the forest side, andconveyed to the castle of Sestus; Leander beingin this encounter unknown to her, by reason hisface was all covered with the blood of his enemies ;Armeliouc entreated him to go with him to the10castle, to which he seemingly consented, but itgrowing dark, he took an opportunity to withdrawhimself till he might better consider how to managehis love affairs ; and so went that night to a neigh¬bouring village, where he refreshed himself, andpresenting the master of the house with some jewels,desired him not to let any one know he was there,if enquiry was made, which he promised and per¬formed.CHAP. III.Ikiv Leander won a rich diamond in a tournament, which hepresents to Hero, with a letter in it manifesting his love ; andoverthrew a great many men that lay in ambush to take his life.Hero being pretty well come to herself, made astrict enquiry after her deliverer, and when shewas told he had secretly withdrawn himself, hereyes could not refrain from tears, that she had nota convenient opportunity to thank him for her de¬liverance ; yet more, she could not but wonder whothis gallant stranger should be, and sent to diversplaces to enquire after him: sometimes she thoughtit could be none but the famed Leander, but thosethoughts were again dashed with the considerationsof his being passed over into Europe, and takingup there with the welcome of triumphs. Aftermany great rejoicings for this happy deliverance,a solemn tilt and tournament was ordered, whereinthe conqueror was to have a golden coronet setwith diamonds, and other precious jewels. Theglorious spot of marshal prowess was proclaimedby the heralds, which soon reached Leander’s ear;whereupon, not to be behind hand, he left his lodg¬ing, and rode to Persepolis, a famous city near athand, and there bought a change of armour, havingon his shield a flaming heart, on which the sun11tdarted ?ome rays through a cloud, with this in¬scription, She for ichom I suffer is ignorant of mylove.Leander thus accoutred, took an opportunity tocome to the tilt just as the trumpets were soundingto action, and found divers champions in readiness,well mounted, who upon the signal, ran two andtwo together, and broke their lances with diverssuccess, many being laid in the dust; but aboveall, the prince Persepolis, who was enamoured ofthe fair Hero, and to whom her father designedher to wed, unhorsed all that came near him ; andthough he was a man of an ill temper, and littlebeloved of any, glorying in his achievements, in abraving manner came and demanded the prize ashis due, unless any other knight would dare toattempt any thing further against him. Leander,who had all this time stood still, that he might becrowned with the greater victory, induced by thosehe had foiled, putting spurs to his horse, enteredthe list, and demanded combat against him ; theyno sooner encountered but the prince was over-tlirown, together with his horse, as if he had beenthunderstruck, which disgrace some of his followersattempting to retrieve, ran the same risk, so thatin the end none daring to appear against him, theprize was declared his ; which he had no soonerreceived, but he laid it at the feet of his mostlovely Hero, telling her, That above all the world,she alone was worthy of so fair a diadem. Shemost modestly refused, and said it was the prize ofhis valour. But he entreated her in so particulara manner, that at length she accepted it, declaringshe would keep it for his sake. Many admiringthis, some with wonder, and others not withoutjealousy; prince Armelious was well pleased with32it, as imagining this stranger could be no otherthan his gallant deliverer ; and the jests being-ended, he caused a lord near him to go and invitehim into the hall, where a sumptuous entertain¬ment was provided; but Leander, who had hisface all the while covered, and not yet willing todiscover himself, returned the prince his humblethanks in the most obliging expressions imaginable,but desired to be excused, saying, he had takenhis repast already, and obliged himself by promiseto return as soon as the sport was ended.This speech satisfied the prince, in that he everheld, that a man of honour was always punctual tohis word: But the prince of Persepolis inwardlygrieved at this stranger’s carrying away the gloryof the day, and fearing he might prove a rival inhis love, (he being passionately enamoured of thefair Hero) sent twelve of his followers after him tomurder him, and tlien to bury him privately thatit might not be known.These men planted themselves in a wood he wasto pass, and when he came opposite them, they allrushed out upon him with their drawn swords, andgave him a furious assault; but he who was neverused to fear, drew his trusty sword that had neverfailed him, and laid about him so furiously, that ina- very short time lie sent eleven of them to keepcompany with the dead, while he that remained,fell on his knees and begged his life, which hegenerously gave him, upon his confessing whoemployed them ; on hearing which, Leander couldnot but wonder how any nobleman could be guiltyof such baseness ; and then commanding him torise, Go, wretched man, said he, and tell thymaster, that treachery never prospers, and that 1wear a sword which may one day let him see the13difference between manhood and such ingloriousacts as these.The trembling man, glad his life was given him,having, by Leander’s orders, dragged his slaincompanions into the wood, with much thankfulnesstook his leave, and related the fatal miscarriage,and also what Leander had given him in charge,which put the prince of Persepolis into an extra¬ordinary rage, so that he foamed and cursed hismisfortunes; in which fret we leave him andreturn to Hero.CHAP. IV.I ha' whtn the (air Hero read Loander’t letter, she was traw-ynirted with joy, and sent Amorissa her servant with a letterin search of him. How he killed a cruel beast which was goingto devour Amorissa ; with several other remarkable passages.You have heard how Hero had received thepresent of Leander, which she curiously surveying,perceived in the curious needle that adorned thecap of it, a little roll of paper thrust in, which sheeagerly, but not without blushing, took out andread it in these words :‘ Fairest of creatures, it is not without cause,‘ that all that cast their eyes on you, become lovers‘ and admirers of your noble perfections, pardon‘ me then, if amongst the rest I have presumed to‘ gaze on so bright an object, which has not only‘ dazzled my eyes, but penetrated my heart, and‘ inflamed me with a desire to serve you : my life‘ and fortune, madam, I lay at your feet, and by‘ my obedience, if permitted to be ranked amongthe number of your adorers, I hope to gain some‘little spark of your condescending goodness to‘ love me, or give me at least your esteem, whenyou come to know who your faithful servant is,14‘ who must beg leave to subscribe himself your‘ entirely devoted. ’‘ LEANDER.’When the princess read this letter, she wastransported with joy, and called Amorissa to con¬sult what was best to be done, and it was agreedbetween them that Amorissa should go in searchof him with the following letter :‘ Sir, though you are a stranger with whom I‘ never had any conversation, yet the fame of‘ Leander’s virtues and renowned deeds, which‘ have taken up the discourse of all the world, can-‘ not, you may well imagine, but have reached the‘ ears of Hero, and created in her an esteem worthy‘ of so deserving a person ; but how you could‘ conceive so great a passion as you expressed in‘ your letter, upon so slight a view, I cannot hastily* believe, since the greatest queen on earth would‘ be proud of Leander’s courtship, and set a diadem‘ on his head for love ; I think, if I mistake not, I‘ owe my life, at least my liberty and honour,‘ which is dearer to me than both, to your valour,‘ and, therefore, in gratitude return you my thanks,‘ and cannot but declare, that it is just when I am‘ an enemy to myself that 1 will be so to Leander.‘ The rest I leave to the bearer, in whom you may‘ repose any confidence, and so take leave to‘ subscribe myself yours in friendship and good‘ wishes.’< HERO.’ IAnd as she was riding by the side of a wood, -she got information of such a person as she de- *scribed having entered the said wood a few hoursbefore. Amorissa immediately pursued the intel- lit-.15ligenco sbe got, till she came to the place wherethe fight had been, where seeing the grass andleaves dyed with blood, she started in a fright andwould fain have returned, but her steed beingheadstrong, carried her away by force. She hadnot rode far before she heard a monster terriblyroaring, who had scented the blood of the slain,and was making towards them to satiate his hungrymaw; but upon hearing the noise of her horse’sfeet, made after her at full cry, which unusualsound piercing the ears of Leander as he sat bythe side of a rivulet, washing olf the blood anddust from his face and armour, occasioned by thecombat, whereat, clapping on his helmet, he cameinto the way with his drawn sword, and perceivinga woman flying and crying for help before a mon¬strous beast, hp made haste to save her, but shethrough fear falling down in a swoon, missing her,tore and rent the horse in a miserable manner.Leander being come up, the monster made athim with all his might, and Leander with ahome-thrust pierced his heart, that he fell downdead with a dismal cry. When he had done this,he came to Amorissa and saluted her, who nowbegan to recover her senses; demanding whatadventure had brought her such a dangerous way?at these words, opening her eyes, and fixing themupon him, she immediately knew him to bo theperson that had won the prize at Sestus, and theman she was in search after, whereupon she fell athis feet, and, with tears of joy in her eyes, said.Sure heaven is this day favourable to me, and tothe fair Hero, in delivering me from death, and is,I hope, putting an end to a more tedious search.Leander, when he heard the name of Hero,’'started, and a little after recovering himself again,10took Amorissa in his arms, and tenderly embracingher, said, for heaven’s sake let me hear that hea¬venly sound again. I think, continued he, younamed Hero; 1 did so, my lord, said she, and hopeyou are Leander ; I am so, said he : 'whereupon shegave him the letter. Upon reading of which, hesaid, I am the happiest man on earth, but think •you, said he, I may ever be so blessed as to see myHero alone, and presume to tell her my love with¬out offending.Amorissa undertook this, but begged that affair*might be carried on as privately as possible, forthat Altemnansor, prince of Persepolis, had de¬clared himself a lover of the princess Hero, and byreason of the power he had in that country, andhis influence over the father of her mistress, mightmuch obstruct their loves, if not make it prove offatal consequence. To all this Leander consented,and gave himself wholly up to be conducted byher management.CHAP. V.Ik>w thro and Leander met, and the mutual agreement theymade ; and how Leander prepared to go to Restns to gain herfather's consent.The joyful Leander now resolved to go to Sestus,and took Amorissa (whose horse the monster hadkilled) up behind him ; by her directions they cameto a curious garden, about half a mile from thepalace, to which Hero used, in the cool of the even- |mg to resort: of this garden she had the keys, andhere they entered, where she left him till she wentand fetched her mistress. When the fair Herocame near the arbour where Leander was, he ven- ;tured out, and with a low submission, falling at 1her feet, thus expressed himself. Pardon me,i lift*17divine creature, if I thus presume to prostratemyself before you, in hopes that so much goodnesscan pardon a crime of so high a nature, and espe¬cially this, seeing it is authorised by love, whosecommands must be obeyed, and whose flames areirresistable. O turn not away those dazzling sunsof light that guide me to my happiness ; but letthose orient eyes shine upon me with beams ofcomfort that I may live by the brightness of theirrays, and the smiles of my fair Hert). He ■wouldhave proceeded, but Hero entreated him to rise,and Amorissa advising them to go into the arbour,as well to keep them from the heat, as from theprying eyes that might be upon them; the twolovers obeyed, being both overjoyed at so happy ameeting. In the arbour, whilst he gently squeezedher hand, which she permitted him to kiss, shetold him she hoped he would not misconstrue heractions, in being so forward in granting him favoursi she had never granted to any one living: then itI was agreed that he should make his public appear-i ance next day at the castle of Sestus, but to bo■ very cautious how he made love to her in public,ior shewed the least sign of it, till she knew how| her father stood inclined to favour him, for though[she loved Leander entirely, yet she looked uponithe consent of her parents as material.CHAP. VI.i L'.ander’t fatal dream, and the treaehcnj of the prime oj Pcnr-i polii to oppose his love. Hero’s father entertains him with joy,yet denies his consent, in favour of the prince of Perse/>olis.II The best and constant lovers having had thepmutual satisfaction of an interview, and in theirS:hearts inseparably linked by the chains of love,lEHero and Amorissa retired, and Leander resolved18to take up his abode, seeing the sun was near set,in that lodge till the next morning ; when, aftermany thoughts coming into his head, he fell asleep,and fancied he had fair Hero in his arms, dancingon the waves, and riding triumphant in Neptune’schariot, as if commanding the seas, when /Eolu^the god of the wind, conspired with all his force,to raise a mighty and prodigious storm, whichoverset his chariot; whereat, for fear of losing 1Hero, who seemed to roll with him on the watery jjsurge, he started and awoke much troubled at such *an unusual dream ; but concluded it only the fancy :of the night, and of his extraordinary love, ho ihushed those cares, and considered how to dispose.of himself next day.Morning being come, he laid his armour in asafe place, and took only his horse, and went tothe castle of Sestus, where the bridge being down, $and the , gates opened, lie entered, and took asecret lodging in a little house in the remotestplace, where Amorissa often visited him, and diversletters passed betwixt him and Hero, who some- jtimes admitted him into her lodgings. At lengthHero resolved, that if she could not gain herfather’s consent, she would without farther delay jmarry Leander, and pass over into Greece withhim ; but just as these thoughts filled her breast,her father came to charge her to entertain Alteman- jsor’s love, laying before her the advantage of suchan alliance, the power and riches of that prince,Ac., but she answered him with tears and entreaties,that she might not have a man she could not love ;this put the old man in a great rage, protesting notonly to disown her, but disinherit her for ever, ifshe disobeyed him. This news she sent Leanderin a letter all blotted with tears, which made him19for sometime like a man beside himself, but resolv¬ing to hazard all for his mistress, he concluded toappear like himself, and so in the most rich attire,which he sent for out of Greece, he appeared oneof the most goodly persons that had ever been seenat the court; so that all admired who this strange?should be, till Hero’s father one day casting hiseyes upon him as ho passed by, ran to him withtears in his eyes, crying out, 0 my deliverer andgood angel, have I found you again! How is itthat you left us after you had saved us from adeath that was so near us ? Leander made modestexcuses on this account, saying, It was no morethan in honour he ought to have done. The oldman was still more abundantly transported whenhe knew it was prince Leander, and took him tothe palace, shewed him all the choice rarities, andmade great feasting for several days, desiring himto demand whatever was in his power to obligehim with, and he would grant it immediately.Leander thinking now was the time, said, sir,for all the favours you have done me, and the offers1 you have made me, I return you my most humbleI thanks; there is but one thing in the world I| desire of you, and if I could but think you would• grant it, I would freely demand it. Demand then,; said he. It is, said Leander, with your leave, to( serve the princess Hero. Armelious started and:«looked pale, protesting that had he not already• promised her to Altemansor, there was no mani under heaven he could more gladly bestow her on,than Leander, whose fame and worth had spreadMover all Asia and Europe; but having sworn to''jgive her him before the high altar, he could not go:ijback from his oath ; or if he should, he beingi powerful in those parts, would take her by force.20aud lay liis iulieritance waste; but Leander toldhim that should never be while he wore a sword.But no entreaties could prevail with him for hisconsent; and Hero having promised to die ratherthan marry any but Leander, though she stoodmuch upon her obedience, Leander could not tellwiiat would be the consequence. So coming toHero, told her the sad news, who gave him freshassurances of her love and constancy ; whereuponhe told her the treachery of Altemansor, and thatneither him nor her were safe on that shore, but ifshe would go with him into Greece, he wouldmarry her royally there; but she still insistedupon her obedience, and told him that time wouldmollify her father’s heart.CHAP. VII.Jlviu pi luce Altemanaor hired one to poieou Leander, but n aspreurnted ; how he afterwards attempted to murder Leanderin his bed, but was himself killed ujxm the spot. With severalmore remarkable passages; coueluding with the unhappydeath of these two unfortunate lovers.By this time the news of Leander’s coming tocourt being known to Altemansor, the person thathad escaped having told him that it was the samethat overthrew him at the tournament, and haddestroyed his men in the wood, he was greatly en¬raged ; aud having secret notice he pretended loveto his mistress, he hired one of Leander’s servantsto poison him with a glass of wine, but as soon ashe was putting it towards his lips, it flew in pieces,whereupon tho wretch seeing the treachery dis¬covered, fell on his knees, begging pardon, auddisclosed the whole matter; upon which, this andthe former treachery was published to the disgrace21and anger of Altemansor. Hero’s father was muchdispleased with this, and went sharply to reprovehim, which made him rage the more, and vowrevenge; yet knowing Leander to be a prince ofgreat courage, and having sufficiently tried hisstrength, durst not challenge him to the combat,but thought if he could any ways destroy him, iti would open his way to Hero’s love : wherefore onenight he broke into his lodgings with about twentymen, which creating some noise, Leander, who had[not time to put on his clothes, got his sword, anddefended himself so well, that he killed the princeand most of his followers, which so alarmed thecastle, that all were up in arms, when Leander,fearing to be opposed, or that revenge would betaken for this proud prince, made his retreat goodwith the slaughter of his enemies, and getting to awindow that jutted into the sea, leaped into thewaves, swam to the shores of Greece, and arrivedsafe at Abides. He thought for these many8 treacheries to have brought over a powerful armyto spoil Persepolis, but the secrecy of his love, andI desire not more to offend Hero’s father, who wast already outrageous for the death of Altemausor.1 he desisted from that resolution. He sent a trustyU servant to hear how things were resented, whoitold him on his return, that his fair mistress wasconfined by her father in a little tower which juttedinto the sea from the castle, and there mournedher captivity and his absence.Leander at this was altogether impatient, andresolved at any terms to free her; whereupon hefj got two of his trusty servants to row him over in a1 little boat, in the night time, and being furnishedwith a ladder of ropes, came safe under the win¬dow ; and calling with a loud voice, Amorissa,22who waited on her mistress, soon heard him, andby his direction fastened the rope-ladder to thebeam of the window, by which he entered, i lero,who was just awakened, trembled to see him there,by reason of her father having promised, if Leandershould be taken, to deliver him up to Aitemansor’sbrother to be punished, who was as cruel andblood-thirsty as the other had been; so that aftermany kisses and embraces, Leauder endeavouredto persuade Hero to make her escape with him toAbides, but she refused it, so that in this privatemanner he often visited her ; she setting in thedark of night a torchlight in the window, to guidehim to the tower. At length her father resolvedto marry her to Aitemansor’s brother within threedays, though she opposed it with her tears andprayers, to prevent a war, and to atone for hisbrother’s death. This fatal decree possessed Herowith mortal fears ; so that she seeing no hope buteither to destroy herself, or be forced into the armsof a man she hated, for Leander’s proffered aid, incase of war, would not be accepted by her father,she consented that the next night he should comewith a small ship to fetch her and Amorissa withall her jewels and treasures into Greece. Theoverjoyed Leander went back to prepare a vessel,which he soon did, and caused it to be drawn inbetween two rocks, lest his purpose might be dis¬covered to the other shore, till it was evening,when, being weary, and lying down to slumber,ho was suddenly awoke by a melodious song sungby two mermaids, who appeared dancing on thewaves.23SONG.Awakb Leander, see the skiesDo in the blackest tempest rise ;In Neptune’s watery kingdomTwo lovers shall entombed be ;Whose sad mishap the sea-gods all,With us lament their funeral:The cruel ghosts’ revenge to crave,But fate decrees them to their grave.We pity lovers that are crost,And in their highest hopes so lost:When nearest to their hopes they seem,They find all hut a golden dream ;Then do cross winds bear awayTheir hopes. Leander, prithee stay ;But thee too forward fate drives on,By love the best of lovers are undone.Leander hearing this, admired much at it, andfound a little heaviness on his mind, however, heresolved to keep his word. About sunset a mightytempest arose, the sea swelled in terror, and allseemed a sudden midnight, when, going towardsthe vessel, he perceived it had broke its cable, andhad driven out to sea with the men on board it;he hailed them as loud as he could, but they stoodaway before the wind, could not get back.Then he ran about the shore to get another vessel,but could find none; so that seeing a light in Hero’sr turret, by which he knew she expected him, heesolved to run any hazard rather than break hisword, and so stripping himself to the shirt, andhiding his clothes in the rock, he leaped into thetsea, in hopes to overtake the vessel, or find it at3ilho place appointed, and so floated on the waves2itill he was lialf the sea over, wheu, as if all theelements had conspired his ruin, rain, thunder,lightning, and winds handed him from wave towave, calling to heaven, and on his fair Hero’sname, till clashing among the rocks on the otherside, lost his noble life ; and Hero, who had im¬patiently expected him all that night, with greedyeyes looked out trembling in the morning, andthere, by the too cruel fate of the rigid destinies, jshe beheld his body floating on the waves ; at thisshe cried out in a lamentable manner, and callingupon his name, leaped out and perished in thewaves, which, after they were dead, drove them on jshore, folded arm in arm ; which sad tragedy beingknown, they were pitied by all as great examplesof love and constancy, and buried in one grave.Hero’s father soon after dying for grief, because ofthe cruelty he had used towards the lovers.

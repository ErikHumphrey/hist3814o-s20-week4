This was theirwhole concern: physicians, waters, vows, andofferings were tried, but all to no purpose. Atlast, however, the queen proved with child, andin due time she was brought to bed of a daugh¬ter. At the christening the princess had sevenfairies for her god-mothers, who were all theycould find in the whole kingdom, that every onemight give her a gift.The christening being over, a grand feast wasprepared to entertain and thank the fairies. Be¬fore each of them was placed a magnificentcover, with a spoon, a knife, and a fork, of puregold and excellent workmanship, set with diversprecious stones; but, as they were all sittingdown at the table, they saw come into the hall avery old fairy, whom they had not invited, be¬cause it was near fifty years since she had beenout of a certain tower, and was thought to havebeen either dead or enchanted.The king ordered her a cover, but could notfurnish her with a case of gold as the others had,because he had only seven made for the sevenfairies. The old fairy, thinking she was slightedby not being treated in the same manner as therest, murmured out some threats between herteethOne of the young fairies who sat by heroverheard how she grumbled, and judging thatshe might give the little princess some unluckygift, she went, as soon as she rose from the ta¬ble, and hid herself behind the hangings, thatshe might speak last, and repair, as much as pos¬sibly she could, the evil which the old fairy mightintend.In the meanwhile, all the fairies began to givetheir gifts to the princess in the following man¬ner :—The youngest gave her a gift, that she shouldbe the most beautiful person in the world.The third, that she would have a wonderfulgrace in every tinny that she did.5The fourth, that she would sing perfectly wellAnd the sixth, that she would play on allkinds of musical instruments to the utmost degreeof perfection.The old fairy’s turn coming next, she advan¬ced forward, and, with a shaking head whichseemed to show more spite than age, she said,That the princess would have her hands piercedwith a spindle, and die of the wound.This terrible gift made the whole companytremble, and every one of them fell a-crying.At this very instant the young fairy came outfrom behind the curtains, and spoke these wmrdsaloud: Assure yourselves, O king and queen,that your daughter shall not die of this disaster.It is true I have not power to undo what myelder has done. The princess shall indeed pierce! her hand with a spindle; but, instead of dying,1 she shall only fall into a profound sleep, which| shall last a hundred years, at the expiration ofwhich a king’s son shall come, and awake herfrom it.The king, to avoid this misfortune, told bythe old splenetic and malicious fairy, caused im¬mediately his royal proclamation to be issuedforth, whereby every person was forbidden, uponpain of death, to spin with a distaff or spindle;6nay, eren to much as to have a spindle in any oftheir houses.About fifteen or sixteen years after the kingand queen being gone to one of their houses ofpleasure, the young princess happened to divertherself by going up and down the palace, when,going up from one apartment to another, she atlength came into a little room at the top of thetower, where an old woman was sitting all alone,and spinning with her spindle.This good woman had not heard of the king’sproclamation against spindles.What are you doing there, Goody ? said theprincess. I am spinning, my pretty child, saidthe old woman, who did not know who she was.Ha ! said the princess, that is very pretty : nowdo you do it ? give it to me, that I may see if Ican do so. The old woman, to satisfy the child’scuriosity, granted her request. She had no soon¬er taken it into her hand, than whether beingvery hasty at it, and somewhat unhandy, or thatthe decree of the spiteful fairy had ordained it, isnot to be certainly ascertained; but, however, itimmediately ran into her hand, and she directlyfell down upon the ground in a swoon.The good old woman, not knowing what todo in this affair, cried out for help. People camein from every quarter in great numbers; some7threw water upon the princess, face, unlaced her,struck her on the palms of her hands, and rub¬bed her temples with Hungary water; but allthey could do did not bring her to herself.The good fairy who had saved her life, bycondemning her to sleep one hundred years, wasin the kingdom of Matakin, twelve thousandleagues off, when this accident befel the princess;but she was instantly informed of it by a littledwarf, who had boots of seven leagues, that is,boots with which he could tread over sevenleagues of ground at one stride. The fairy leftthe kingdom immediately, and arrived at the pal¬ace in about an hour after, in a fiery chariot drawnby dragons.The king handed her out of the chariot, andshe approved of every thing he had done; but,as she had a very great fore-sight, she thoughtthat when the princess should awake, she might{ not know what to do with herself, being all alonein this old palace ; therefore she touched with herwand every thing in the palace, except the kingand queen, governesses, maids of honour, ladiesof the bed-chamber, gentlemen, officers, stewards,cooks, under-cooks, scullions, guards, with thenbeef-eaters, pages, and footmen; she likewisetouched all the horses that were in the stables,.. as well pads as others, the great dog in the outei8court, and the little spaniel bitch which lay byher on the bed.Immediately on her touching them they alltell asleep, that they might not wake before hermistress, and that they might be ready to waitupon her when she wanted them. The very spitsat the fire, as full as they could be of partridgesand pheasant, and every thing in the place, wheth¬er animate or inanimate, fell asleep also.All this was done in a moment; for fairies arenot long in doing their businessAnd now the king and queen, having .kissedtheir child without waking her, went out of thepalace, and put forth a proclamation, that nobodyshould come near it. This, however, was unne¬cessary ; for in less than a quarter of an hour,there got up all around the park such a vast num¬ber of trees, great and small bushes, and bram¬bles, twined one within the other, that neitherman nor beast could pass through, so that noth¬ing could be seen but the very tops of the towersof the palace, and not that too, unless it was agood way off. Nobody doubted but the fairygave therein a very extraordinary sample of horart, that the princess, while she remained sleep-ing, might have nothing to fear from any curiouspeople.When a hundred years were gone and-pastj9the son of a king then reigning, and who wasof another family from that of the sleepingprincess, being out a hunting on that side of thecountry, asked what these towers were which hesaw in the midst of a great thick wood. Everyone answered according as they had heard, somesaid it was an old ruinous castle, haunted by spir¬its : others, that all the sorcerers and witcheskept their sabbath, or weekly meeting, in thatplace.The most common opinion was, that an ogree*lived there, and that he carried thither all thelittle children he could catch, that he might eatthem up at his leisure, without any body being-able to follow him, as having himself only powerto pass through the wood.The prince was at a stand, not knowing whatto believe, when an aged man spoke to himthus :May it please your highness, it is about fiftyyears since I heard from my father, who heardmy grandfather say, that there was then in thiscastle a princess, the most beautiful that was everseen, that she must sleep there for a hundred* An ogree is a giant with long teeth and claws,a raw head and bloody bones; who runs awaywith little boys and girls, and eats them up.10years, and would be wakened by a king’s son, for•. bom she was reserved.The young prince was all on fire at thesewords, believeing, without considering the mat¬ter, that he could put an end to this rare adven¬ture, and, pushed on by love and honour, resolv-ed that moment to look into it.Scarce had he advanced towards the wood,when all the great trees, the bushes, and bram¬bles, gave way of their own accord, and let himpass through. He went up to the castle, whichhe saw at the end of a large avenue, which hewent into; and what not a little surprised himwas, he saw none of his people could follow him,because the trees closed again as soon as he passedthrough them.However, he did not cease from valiantly con¬tinuing his way. He came into a spacious out¬ward court, where every thing he saw might havefrozen up the most hardy person with horror There reigned all over a most frightful silence,the image of death every where shewed itself,and there was nothing to be seen but stretched-out bodies of men and animals, all seeming tobe dead.He, however, very well knew, by the rosy facesand the pimpled noses of the beef-eaters, thatthey were only asleep ; and their goblets, where-11in still remained some few drops ot wine, plainlyshowing that they all had fallen asleep in theircups.He then, crossing a court, paved with marble,went up stairs, and came into the guard-cham¬ber, where the guards were standing in theirranks, with their muskets upon their shoulders,and snorting as loud as they could. After that,he went through several rooms full of gentlemenand ladies all asleep, some standing and otherssitting.i\t last he came into a chamber all gilt withgold; here he saw, upon a bed, the curtains otwhich were all open, the finest sight that everhe beheld—a princess, who appeared to be aboutfifteen or sixteen years of age, and those resplend¬ent beauty had in it something divine. He ap¬proached with trembling and admiration, and felldown before her on his knees. And now the en¬chantment was at an end; the princess awaked,and looked on him with eyes more tender thanthe first view might seem to admit of. Is it youmy prince ? said she to him; you have waited along time.The prince, charmed with these words, andmuch more with the manner, in which they werespoken, asured her that he loved her better thanhimself.12Their discourse was so well conducted, thatthey did weep more than talk; there was verylittle eloquence, but a great deal of love. Hewas more at a loss than she was, and no wonder,as she had time to think on what to say to him ;for it is very probable, though the history men¬tions nothing of it, that the good fairy, during solong a sleep, had given her agreeable dreams.In short, they talked four hours together, andyet said not half of what they had got to say.In the mean time all in the palace awaked,every one thinking on his particular, business;and as all of them were not in love, they wereready to die with hunger. The chief lady ofhonour, being as sharp set as the others, grewvery impatient, and told the princess aloud, thatthe supper was served up. The prince helpedthe princess to rise, she being entirely dressed,and very magnificent; though his royal highnessdid not forget to tell her, that she was dressedlike his grandmother, and had a point-band peep¬ing over a high collar; but, however, she lookednot less beautiful and charming for all that.They went into the great hall of lookingglasses, where they supped, and were served bythe officers of the princess; the violins and haut¬boys played all old tunes, but very excellent,though it was now about a hundred years since13they had lived. And after supper, without los¬ing any time, the lord almoner married them inthe chapel of the castle, and the chief lady ofhonour drew the curtains.They had but very little sleep that night, theprincess had no oecasion ; and the prince left herthe next morning to return into the city, wherehis father had been in great pain anxious for hisreturn.The prince told him he had lost his way inthe forest as he was hunting, and had lain at thecottage of a collier, who had given him somebrown bread and cheese.The king his father, who was a very goodman, readily believed him; but his mother thequeen could not be persuaded that this was alto¬gether true; and, seeing that he went almostevery day a hunting, and that he had alwaysfound some excuse for so doing, though he hadlain out three or four nights together, she beganto suspect (and very justly too) his having somelittle private amour, which he then endeavouredthat she should remain ignorant of.Now these frequent excursions, which he thenmade from the palace, where the times that heretired to the princess, with whom he lived inthis manner for about two years, and by whomhe had two fine children, the eldest of whom w as14a girl, whom they named Morning, and theyoungest a boy, whom they mimed Day, becausehe was a great deal handsomer and much morebeautiful and comely than the sister.The queen’s jealousy increasing, she severaltimes spoke to her son, desiring him to informher after what manner he spent his time, alleg¬ing that, as he saw her so very uneasy, he oughtin duty to satisfy her. But he never dared totrust her with his secret; for she was of the raceof ogers, and the king would certainly not havemarried her, had it not been for her vast riches.It was whispered about the court that she hadan ogerish inclination, and that whenever shesaw any little children going by, she had all thedifficulty in the world to refrain from falling uponthem; so the prince would never tell her oneword.But when the king was dead, which happenedabout two years afterwards, and he saw himselflord and master, he then openly declared hismarriage, and went in great ceremony to con¬duct his queen to the palace. They made a verymagnificent entry into the city, with her twochildren beside her,Some time after the king went to make warwith the emperor Cantalabute, his neighbour.He left the government ot the kingdom to theqn een his mother, and earnestly recommended toher the care of his wife and children.As soon as he was departed, the queen sentfor her daughter-in-law to come to her, and then■sent her to a country house among the woods,that she might with more ease and secrecy grati¬fy her inclinations.Some few days after she went to this countryhouse herself, and calling for the clerk of thekitchen, she said to him, I have a mind to eatlittle Morning for my dinner to-morrow.Ah 1 madam, cried the clerk of the kitchen, ina very great surprise. No excuse, replied she,interrupting him; I will have it so;—and thisshe spoke in the tone of an ogress, seeming tohave a strong desire to taste fresh meet. Andto make the dish more delicious, added she, I willcat her with sauce made of Robert.This poor man, knowing very well how dan¬gerous it was to play tricks with ogresses, tookhis great knife and went up into little Morning’schamber. She was then four years old, and cameup to him leaping and laughing, to take himabout the neck, and asked him for some sugar-candy, on which he began to weep, and the knifefell out of his hand; and he w'eit into the backyard and killed a lamb, which he dressed with16such good sauce, that his mistress asured himshe had never eaten any thing so good in all herlife.He had at the same time taken up little Morn¬ing, and carried her to his wife, in order that shemight be concealed in a lodging which he had atthe bottom of the court-yard.The queen’s lascivious appetite (according toher own apprehensions) being once humoured,she again began to long for another dainty bit.Accordingly, a few days after, she called for theclerk of the kitchen, and told him that she in¬tended that night to sup out of little Day. Heanswered never a word, being resolved to cheather as he had done before. He went out to findlittle Day, and saw him with a foil in his hand,with which he was fencing with a monkey, thechild being but three years old. He took himup in his arms and carried him to his wife, thatshe might conceal him in her chamber, alongwith his sister; and, in the room of little Day,cooked up a young kid very tender, which theogress praised as much as the former, saying i<was wonderfully good.• All hitherto was mighty well; but a few even¬ings after this craving ogress said to the clerk ofthe kitchen, I will also eat the young queen withthe same sauce that I had with the children.17Now was the critical time; for the poor clerkdespaired of being able to deceive her.The young queen was turned of twenty yearsof age, not counting the hundred years she hadbeen asleep, though her skin was somewhat toughyet she was fair and beautifal; and how to finda beast in the yard so firm that he might killand cook for to appease her canine appetite, waswhat puzzled him greatly, and made him totallyat a loss what to do.He then took a resolution that he must savehis own life, and cut the queen’s throat; and, go¬ing into her chamber with an intent to do it atonce, he put himself into as great a fury as hecould, went into the queen’s room with his dag¬ger in his hand. However, his humanity wouldnot allow him to surprise her, but he told her,with a great deal of respect, the orders he hadreceived from the queen her motherDo it, said she, stretching out her neck; exe¬cute your orders, and I shall go and see my child-.en, whom I so dearly love. For she thoughtthem dead ever since they had been taken fromher.No, fair princess I cried the humane clerk ofthe kitchen, all in tears; you shall see your child¬ren again. But then you shall go with me tomy lodgings, where I have concealed them; anaI shall deceive the queen once more, by giving |her another young kid in your stead.Upon this he forthwith conducted her to herchamber, where he left her to embrace her child¬ren, and cry aloud with them; and he then wentand dressed a young kid, which the queen hadfor supper, and devoured it with the same appe¬tite as though it had been the young queenNow was she exceedingly delighted with thisunheard-of cruelty, and she had invented a storyto tell the king at his return, how the mad wolveshad eaten up the queen his wife, with her twochildren.One evening some time after, as she was, ac¬cording to her usual custom, rambling about thecourt and yards of the palace, to see it she couldsmell any fresh meat, she heard, in a ground-room, little Day crying, for his mother was go¬ing to whip him because he had been guilty ofsome fault, and she heard at the same time littleMorning soliciting pardon for her brotherThe ogress presently knew the voice of thequeen and her children, and, being quite in a rageto think she had been thus deceived, she com¬manded the next morning, by break of day, ina most terrible voice, which made every onetremble, that they should bring into the middleof the court a very large tub, which she caused19to be filled with toads, vipers, snakes, and allsorts of serpents, in order to throw into it thequeen and her children, the clerk of the kitchen,his wife and maid; all of whom she had givenorders to have them all brought thither, withtheir hands tied behind them, to sufifer the ven¬geance of the incensed ogress.They were brought out accordingly, and theexecutioners were going to throw them into thetub, when the king fortunately entered the courtin his carriage, and asked, with the utmost as¬tonishment, what was meant by this horrid spec¬tacle ; no one daring to tell him.When the ogress saw what had happened, shefell into a violent passion, and threw herself headforemost into the tub, and was instantly devour¬ed by the ugly creatures she had ordered to bethrown into it for others.The king could not but grieve being very*orry, for she was his mother; but he soon com¬forted himself with his beautiful wife, and histwo pretty children. And after all things weresettled, he well rewarded the clerk of the kitchenfor his wisdom, humanity and compassion.20THE MORAL.To get a husband rich, gentle, and gay,Of humour sweet, some time to stayIs natural enough, ’tis true;But then to wait a hundred years,And all the while asleep, appearsA thing entirely new.Now at this time of day,Not one of all the sex w'e seeTo sleep with such found tranquillity.But yet this fable seems to let us know,That very often Hymen’s bless is sweet,Although some tedious obstacles they meetWhich makes us for them a long while stay.And that we nothing lose by such delay.But warm’d by nature’s lambient fires,The sex so ardently aspires,Of this blest state the sacred joys t’ embrace,And with each earnest heart pursue’m,I've not the will, I must confess,Nor yet the power of fine address,To preach this moral to ’em.21PADDY AND THE BEAR.About the time I was a boy, Archy Thompsonlived in Cushendall, lower part of county Antrim.He was a great man; kept a grocer’s shop, andwas in fact a complete Jack Factotum, and soldevery thing portable, from a needle to an anchor;. he was a ponderous fellow, wore a wig like a bee-' hive, and was called the king of Cushendallj One night, when he was returning home from a| friend’s wake, he found a male child at the shop| door some months old ; he embraced it—swore hewould keep it, and wras as fond of him as ever| Stjnire Allworthy was of Tom Jones. A womanwas sent for to nurse him ; they called her Snou-i! ter Shaughnessy, because she wanted the nose.—I Snouter had no suck, and poor Paddy (for so hewas christened) was spoon-fed, and soon grew aI stout, well-built fellow, and to show his grati-i; tude, (for Paddy had a heart) would do all theI work about the house himself. He was likeScrub in the Beaux Stratagem, servant of allwork; he milked the cow; he cleaned the byre,and thatched it; he went to market; he soled theshoes; he cleaned the knives; he shaved; andpowdered his master’s wig; and, in short, did asmuch work in one day as an ordinary servant! would do in a week. Paddy’s delight was in fre¬quenting wakes and listening to all sorts of mar¬vellous stories, which he would swallow down22ust the more readily the more marvellous theywere.—His master having gone one day to Bel¬fast, he went to old Brien Sollaghan’s wake,where a lad just come home from a foreign voy¬age was telling stories out of the course of nature,improbable. Paddy believed all he was relatingbut something about blackamoors; for he swore“ ’twas impossible for one man to be black, andanother man white, for he could not be naturallyblack without he was paintedbut,” says he,‘ 1 11 ask the master in the morning, when hecomes home, and then I’ll know all about it.’ Sohe says in the morning, ‘ Master, is there anysuch a thing as a blackamoor ?’ ‘ To be sure thereis, as many as would make regiments of them,but they’re all abroad.’ ‘ And what makes themblack ?’ ‘ Why, it’s the climate, they say.’ ‘ Andwhat’s the climate ?’ ‘ Why I don’t know : I be¬lieve it’s something they rub upon them whenthey’re very young.’ ‘ They must have a deal ofit, and very cheap, if there’s as many of them asyou say.—The next time you’re in Belfast, I wishyou’d get a piece of it, and we’ll rub little Barneyover with it and then we can have a blackamoorof our own. But as I'm going in the Irish Vol¬unteer, from Larne to America, in the spring,I’ll see them there. Paddy went over as a re-demptioner and had to serve a time for his pass¬age. One day he was sent by his master sixnwiles from Baltimore, to the heights of Derby,jii an errand. Paddy, thinking and ruminatingl>n the road that he had not yet seen a blackamoor,ibrgot the directing-post on the road, and got en-fangled in a forest; it happened to be deep snow,.nd there was a large black bear lying at the toot•f a tree, which he did not observe till within aew yards of him. ‘ Hurra, my darling!’ saysie, ‘ here’s one of them now at last—queen oflory! such a nose as he has: they talk about^oughey Fadaghan’s nose; why, the noses of allbe Fadaghans put together would not make thisshow’s nose. I never saw one of your sort be-'!>re,’ says Paddy; ‘ why, man, you’ll get yourleath of cowld lying there ; I have an odd testerjjet left, that I brought from Cushendall, and ifmere’s a shebeen near this, I’ll give you a snif-;r, for I’d like to have a talk with you.’ ‘ Boo,’lys the bear. ‘ Lord, what a voice he has—hejuld sing a roaring song.’ ‘ Boo, boo!’ again* ies the bear. ‘ Who are you booing at, may It ? for if it’s fun you‘re making of me, ram myit up to the elbow in you.‘ Up get the bear,id catches Paddy by the shoulder. ‘ Is it forrestling you are ?—Cushendall for that—soul,at you grip too tight, my jewel; you had betterke your fist out of my shoulder, or I‘ll take anifair advantage of you.‘ Paddy went to catchm by the middle; ‘ O sweet bad luek to you,24you thief, and the tailor that made your breechesyou’re made for wrestling, but I’ll nick you.’Paddy pulled out his tobacco-knife, and gave hima prod in the right place, and down he fell to riseno more. ‘ O murther; what will become of menow ?’ says he—4 I’ve killed this big, ugly blackblackguard, and I’ll be hanged for him. O mur¬der, murder! O what will become of me!’ Aproprietor of the place, comes up at the moment,* What is all this about ?—what’s the matter, mygood fellow ?’ ‘ Oh, your honour’s glory, I’m astranger .—I’m from Cushendall, your honour, Inever seen a blackamoor before, and I just askedone of them to take a drop with me; but he woulddo dothing but make fun of me, so I gave him aprod, for I could not get hold of him—Stop, stopthere’s a bear lying there, take care.’—‘ the black¬amoor,’ ‘ By the holy father’, says Paddy, ‘ is thata bear! faith then I’ll engage I’ll drop them toyou for a tester a-dozen.’ The gentleman ad¬mired his courage so much, that he went to Bal¬timore, bought off his time, and made him anoverseer of his estate, which he filled with inte¬grity ; and after seventeen years, came home tohis native country, left what he had saved to oldSnouter’s grand-children, and had his bones laidin the same Trave with his old and loving master.FiMa

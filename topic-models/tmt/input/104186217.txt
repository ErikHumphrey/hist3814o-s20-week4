Redmond 0‘Hanlon.EDMOND 0‘H ANLON, was the son of areputable gentleman, who had a consider¬able estate, and lived at the foot of Slygunninmountains, in the county of Armagh, among avast number of relations, several whereof wereof the same name. After his parents had givenhim the best education the time and place couldafford} they obtained a small post for him in thearmy, where he served a few years with credit,though very young, until the reduction of theIrish forces, in this kingdom, among which ourRedmond was one.The nation being reduced by the English forces,several Irish families, who had a hand in the warsof Ireland, were dispossessed, and their lands for¬feited j by which means a very great alterationwas made in this family, and several of theO’Hanions were obliged to trave‘1, in hopes of re¬trieving their fortunes. But poor Redmond, inthis unhappy condition, once happened to be atthe killing of a gentleman in a quane), and flyingfor safety, stayed abroad fer a long time, still re¬fusing to come to a trial till he was outlawed.3which put him to his shifts. But our hero iw_ing received instructions in the art of war, and1being naturally of an undaunted courage, waseasily led into the secret of invading other men’sproperties, both on the highway and by breakingopen of houses, till he had acquired as much mo¬ney as might have put him in a way to live abovethe frowns of fortune, with good management al!his life.But seeming to relish this new course of lifemore than the former, he proceeded in his rob¬beries, until from an infancy in the art, he becameone of the most notorious and expert of that pro¬fession, that had ever bern bred in the kingdom«f Ireland. He had made himself acquainted withall the bye passages in the country, and knew everylurking place in the mountains of Newry and Sly-gunnin, so that whoever pretended to pursue him,made but fruitless attempts, and commonly re¬turned with loss and shame, like dogs that losttheir ears, both before and after the rewards werej offered by the government for apprehending him.He was strong and active, and as occasion re¬quired, could perform his feats either on foot oron horseback: and tho’ He was so notorious aplunderer, yet he was naturally of'a very generousdisposition, frequently giving share of what he. got from the rich to relieve the poor in their ne-■, cessities. His remarkable actions and surprisingi| attempts, spread his character through all the< country; and being joined by a great number ofil his former acquaintances, (adventurous lads, whoI became his associates spontaneously,) until hisi company was augmented to the number of fifty.1 active men, mostly his own relations, he then be-4 gan to take upon him a captain’s Command, and4a brigade to act in every province, who*vere always to return (barring accidents,) fourtimes a-year to the general place ot rendezvous,and give an account of their success, and as soonas the booty v as regularly divided, each brigadewas ordered to c-xch ,nge posts, and to march outon duty again. This was their constant practicefor'some years, by which policy thev kept them¬selves concealed much longer than otherwise theywould have done. However, there was no rob¬bery committed any where at all in the kingdomhut was attributed to captain O’Hanlon, thoughif is probable he might have been an hundredmiles distant at the same time. Nay so w ell washis character established, and so .notorious hijactions, that it became a common proverb, whenany one had a mind to brand another with infamyand scandal, for him to say, you are as great a jrogue as Ri dmond O’Hanlon.As Redmond was once gliding along the road Ibetween Newry and Armagh, like a kite in the iair in quest of prey, with only two or three at- Itendants, who were at some distance behind him, jhe overtook a pedlar crying out and bemoaning |his misfortune, in a .very moving and piteous man- |ner. Redmond taking compassion of the pedlar, tcame up and asked him what had befallen him ? fTo whom the pedlar replied: “That damned irogue of a Redmond O’Hanlon, has robbed me [of above five pounds in monies, which was all I Ihad, and that would not satisfy him neither, buthe has taken my box away too, and because Istrove to hold it, he knocked me down andderckedme, and abused me like a dog.” Redmond* in*censed at such language, had hardly patience tohear the fellow tell out his story, before he in-5I terrupted him, and cilled him a rascal nn-I a lying! Son of a whore: ‘ flow could l 10b you, said he,I that never seen you before ? You dog, she w ihe'1 which way he went, and I’ll convince you that it1 was none of Redmond O’Haulon that robbed you.’By the time the fellow had described the robbe'f,! and shewed the road he took, Red nond’s com-! pany came up, and they all went ui pursuit of tne’ new rogue, whom they overtook, with the pedlar’s' box under his arm, and brought him back to theplace where he committed the robbery. He knew. -himself guilty of the fact, and returned the petiiarboth his money and box, without waiting to beexamined, being no way acquainted witn Red”mono or any of his party Upon this captainI O'Hanlon said, he would teach him to rob in li'5I name, and without his licence or permission, andbound the pedlar under an obligation to prosecutethe fellow at the next ensuing assizes, and thenwrote a mittimus and sent the criminal with aproper guard to the gaol of Armagh The ptdfhr was as good as his word, and prosecuted himto the very utmost, upon which the fellow wasfound guilty, and accordingly executed : He Was• not altogether so destitute of friends but that hehad counsel to ple. J for him who insisted verymuch upon the error in commitment,* and pre-■ * The mittimus we are informed run thus, by RedmondOTiinioii, in loco of one of His Majesty’s Justice* of the peacetor the said county, but ciiief ranger of the mountains.“ 1 herewith send you the body of , who was this daybrought before me, and examined, for robbing Mr. — on theking’* high toa -1.requiring of you to hold him in custody untilthe next general assize to be held for the said county, and forso dojng, this shall be your sufficient warrant."Given under my hand this 1st day of March. 1095.REDMOND 0*1*ANi ,»,cTo —■ ■- Oaoler of Armagh.ovaiieu iu far in court, as to have the trial posl-p'onned; but this was of no other service than togive rise to as pleasant a fit of merriment in courtas ever happened upon such an occasion, thejudges and every one else laughing until theyvvere ready to burst, at the conceit of Redmond’sacting the justice of peace.Redmond had a much greater antipathy to theEnglish, than to the Scotch and Irish: for he wasalways kind to his countrymen, and made a bar¬gain both with them and the North country ped¬lars, and all such as acknowledged his jurisdic¬tion all over the kingdom, alledging for excuse,that- as he was a reduced gentleman, he hopedhis countrymen would not refuse to pay him tri¬bute towards his maintenance, upon his desistingto plunder. Upon this .he made proposals, thatwhoever paid him half a-crown per annum, hewould indemnify them from robbers of ail kinds;but if at any time they neglected to remit himhis salary, and run in arrears, they were sure topay for it. .Such as made this bargain with him,had their names registered in his pocket-book,and were so little afraid of losing any of theirgoods by robbers, that they thought their effectsas safe in the fields ns in the house ; for if at anytime they happened to have any thing stolen, uponapplication to Redmond, he u'ould make the mostdiligent search that could possibly be made inall parts of the kingdom, until he found it and re¬stored it to the owner, and if he failed to find it,always allow ed his benefactor two years salary tocompensate the loss. But he had so many emis¬saries, and such good intelligence, and all otherpettv rogues were so much afraid of him and hisparty, that none of them dared to disoblige him ;7and besides every petty robber was served 'with acopy of the registered names, and‘had strict or*ders not to meddle with any thing that belongedto such, but to assist the loser in searching forhis goods ; so that his friends seldom sufferedunder his protection.Having once got cold upon some desperateoccasion, it threw him into a dangerous fever, ofwhich he recovered ; yet the place being dampwhere he lay, he lost the use of his limbs, andcontinued a cripple or lame for some years; Yetduring this time he was preserved among hisfriends, who had a great esteem for him, andescaped from being taken, tho* he was proclaimeda tory, and a robber, and a reward of L.50 wasoffered for taking of him, which occas'oned fre¬quent searches after him. He likewise waspunctually paid his salary or tribute all the timeby his benefactors or allies ; (except a few whobroke the truce, but dearly paid for it after{)though robberies were not so frequent during hisiliness as before, so that he wTas under the neces¬sity of making his pay maintain him until he wasable to go about again.As soon as he had recovered the use of hisKmbs, he took the field again and scoured all theroads in the country, sometimes alone and some¬times with company, and took Special care to re¬venge himself on all those who had neglected tosend him his yearly pension when he was out oforder, but found himself so closely hunted, thathe fixed his head quarters in and about the bogof Allen, for a considerable time, where he com¬mitted such a number of notorious robberies, thatthe country were obliged to keep unde*- arms toguard tueir effects. The goverment taking this8atlair again into consideration, a fresh proclamationwas issued out offering a reward of L 250 for th^raking of him : upon which several attempts weremade to secure him, but to no effect; though hewas once taken in bed near (iioubullock, but hadthe good fortune to he rescued by his comrades,2s his captors were leading him to Naas gaol.Tito’ he was very well acquainted 31! ever thekingdom, yet he was .loath to venture his carcaseany longer in this place, and among strangers,for fear of a second disaster ; so he took an op¬portunity of conveying himself privately to hi^old quarters on Shguuniri, where he remained,some time, ami carrying on his game, with greatsuccess, before his enemies had tune to seek him.- Soon tfter his'rctuto- he was in company with,seme of his assoeiaies, bevond' Armagh, wherethey met with cornet Montgomery’s steward,who having received above L.500 from Iris mas¬ter’s tcnnancs 00 an estate he had in. that country,was carrying it home to his own house, nearKijk-vati in, the cqoipty of Monaghan where hedwelt. Redmond stood at a little distance allthe time of the action, and observed the disputeon both sides, and the defence made by thesteward, which, though he maintained it withbravei * for some time, yet was overpowered bynumbers, and obliged to deliver his purse to savehis life. When the booty was divided, captainO’Kanlon made a present of his part to the cor-,net’s young son, who was at nurse in the sameplade, which he sect by the steward, with strict or¬ders to deliver it, and took his acknowledgementfor the same payable on demand. This he didout of a, pure regard that he had for die cornet,on account of some favour he had done him for9merly; and the cornet, to make him a requitalfor so generous an actios, made a promise thathe would use his best endeavours to obtain theking’s pardon for him, in hopts of him forsakinghis new trade,- and was as good as his word, asby the sequel will appear.A little after this action, a merchant in Dundalkhad a draught on a merchant in Newry, for alarge sum, but was so much afraid of RedmondO’Hanlon, that he was afraid either to send forthe money, or to go for it himself; while he wasthus tonsuhing with his wife how to get the moneysafely home, his apprentice, a lad about sixteenyears of age, overheard their discourse, and assoon as he got an opportunity, desired his masterto tell him why he was so mvich afraid of send¬ing to Newry ? The master having answered hisrequest, the bey asked him whether he wouldventure to trust him with so much hnohey ? Themaster said he did not doubt ins honesty, but onthat occasion he could not know what to think ofthe mattea-. However, by many entreaties, theboy prevailed on the master to let him go for thej money, promising to forfeit his ears if he lost onehalfpenny of it The boy having obtained privi-; lege to go for the money, immediately set about! preparing himseT for the journey ; and by hismaster’s assistance, being provided with aboutforty shillings in halfpence', he divided them intotwo parcels, and tied them close up in a littlewallet, at each end, and then went to the fieldand brought home an old vicious stone herse,; (much ot the same humoui with Sir Teague0‘ReganV war horse, on which he rode out tomeet duke Scomberg after the surrender ofCharlemoUnt,) that when any other came up to10r/ect J.ir.i or. the road, he always strove to biteor kick him, by which means he commonly keptthe road to himself. With proper accoutrementsthe boy mounted, and had the fortune to meetRedmond on the road as he was going, who, asit was usual with him, demanded where he wasgoing ! The boy told him to Newry. Pray whatbusiness have yco. there ? says Redmond. WhySays the hoy, to receive above L.100 for niymaster. And when do you think you’ll be back }cays Redmond. Why, says the boy, I believeiibout this time-morrow. Well, my good boy,says Redmond, you had better take care not totell every body what your business is, for fearyou should be robbed,—Oh, says the boy. I’msure such a gentleman as you would not vob me,I do not intend to tell any body else. Upon thisRedmond made him a present of a ducat to drinkhis health, or to hire another horse, if the one hehad under him should tire; and so they partedgood friends for that time.Redmond was then under some necessities fora little money; and as none of his companionswere present to the dialogue, he was resolved notto let them know any thing of the matter, thathe might have all the booty to himself: And tomake himself more sure of the prey, he orderedhis comrades to a different post the next morning,and waited himself alone on the road leading fromNewry, until the bey returned.When the boy came in sight, Redmond salutedhim, and began ts ask him the necessary ques¬tions about the money The boy confessedthat he had received it, upon which the otherdesired him to let him see it. The boy madeseveral excuses,, .but they all availed him nothing,11for, the other began to demand "with someauthority, and would have taken hold of him, hadhe not been something afraid of receiving a kickfrom the mad horse. Among other excuses, theboy alledged that his master would think he had.made away with the money himself, for whichreason he could not part with it, but Redmondthreatening to shoot him if he refused any longer,the boy took his wallet, and cast it over a sloughby the road side, and told Redmond that if hemust have it, he should follow it. Upon thisRedmond alighted from his horse, and havingtied him to a tree, with some difficulty he got tothe place where the wallet lay. While he wasupon this expedition, the boy exchanged horses,much for the better, and rode home with speed,having the money he received at Newty. safelyquilted up in his waistcoat, and though Redmondcalled after him to stay, yet he left him to makethe best hand he could of an old garron and a bagof halfpence.Shortly after this, Redmond was presentedwith the king’s protection for three years, on trialof his good behaviour, by cornet Montgomery,and remained for the space of two years very in¬offensive in the country, and kept company withsome of the best gentlemen in the kingdom*, how¬ever, though he knew wetl, if he had continuedhis good behaviour for the term granted, he mighthave obtained a general pardon, yet this honestway of living did not relish well with him : hehad an itch to be at the old gams, and accord-ingly, began it before the limited time was ex¬pired, growing ten times more wicked and no¬torious than ever he had been before.In imitation of Olivet Cromwell, lord protector12-t% eh?* common wealth, he took upon him eitherthe title of protector of the rights and propertiesof Ids bene he tors arid contributors, chief raneefof rhe. mountains, surveyor general of the highroads of Ireland, or lord examiner of all passengers,committing such viHani.es and barbarities on sturdytravel'ersv. as were never heard of before, oftendriving away whole herds of rattle from such asin contempt of his protection an 1, authority, hadgiven him offence by runnirg in arrears. Yet heseldom robbed;a poor.man, but on the contrary,was alwavs generotis fo men in necessity or dis¬tress., Having Once overtaken a poor man, whohad but one cow, which he was driving to a fairto be sold, to raise the rent for his landlord, heasked him several questions, till he found certainlythat he was in-want, and then lent him five pounds,which he was t* pay him, at an inn, a few weeksafter. The poor man went with the money ac¬cording to compact, which pleased Redmond sowell, that he bestowed it and five pounds moreon him.He was likewise very generous to a soldier, ifhe met hint alone, and understood the art of dis¬simulation, or disguising himself, as well as anysometimes appearing like an officer, some¬times like a country gentleman, and sometimeslike a footman, andv could alter the tone of hisvoice at pleasure-,, so tint the soldiers seldomknew him, though,he often gave them money todrink. The Duke pf Ormond, ordered a party offont and horse to pursue him, who being irformedwhere he was, but not mistrusting his disguise,went after him ho£ foot. Redmond dressed him¬self like an officer, and went quietly along the.highroad, until he saw the red coats at a good13distance behind him ; then he hastened to H Eet1-tleman’s house, near the road, and tol 1 them hewas an officer, who was sent out with a party ofmen, in pursuit of Redmond O’Hanlon, but be¬ing a httle fatigued, made bold to call and resthimself until his men came up then desiring thepeople of the house, to call him as soon as theypassed by, he stretched himself down to rest.The soldiers had not gone above an bundled yardspast the end of the avenue, before Redmond wentout on pretence of meeting them at a style, by theroad side, a quarter of a mile off; but his intentwas to rm-ke his escape another way.Not long afterwaids he appeared, in Armagh,in the habit of a country gentleman, and requestedof the commandin'' officer, there, to let him havea few men to guard him about eight miles fur:her,for fear of being met by any of RedmondO'Hanlcr.’s party, because he had a charge ofmoney about him. 1 he request was granted. Heand the men passed on very jocosely for aboutseven miles, when he to’d them he wss out ofdanger, and they might go back •. he gave everyman a piece of money, and desired them to makea discharge for • jov of his safe passage, whichthey did ; then hit dmired them to charge and dothe like again, until at length they Udd him theirammunition war spent. ! bis was what he ex¬pected, and giving a whistle, a parcel of his gangsprung out ol the ihiclcee. who-stripped the sol¬diers of their arms, morrev, accoutrements, andclothes, in wdsich shameful condition they wereobliged to go back to their quarters.The escape he mode at the four mile house,between Dundalk and Newry, may claim thereaders attention. Being, there, overtaken by an14officer and twelve men, he was made prisoner,but seeming to have great respect for the soldiers,and they for him, there was no dispute made.His ready compliance and civility drew com¬passion from the men towards him, and he treatedthem with north country whisky, taking care todrink sparingly himself, until thev were all over¬come with that heady liquor. While they werein this condition, he got them all tied neck andheels, and leaving them in that posture, marchedoff with their arms.The government being justly incensed at hisproceeding, issued out a proclamation, offeringa reward for his head, dead or alive.A captain of foot being informed of one of hishaunts, chose out twenty of the most active menin the barrack, who stripped themselves to theirwaistcoats, and marched out in pursuit of him,before break of day, with nothing but their mus¬kets and bayonets, and a little provision. Inabout two hours they invested his castle of defencebut had the mortification to hear him call out froman adjacent hill, bidding defiance, for it seems,he had warning of their approach. Upon thisthe military men held a consultation of war,■wherein it was resolved to divide themselves. Thecaptain and ten men were to follow the chace inthe centre, and five men on each wing, who werealways to keep within a quarter of a mile of themain body. In this manner they followed himuntij noon ; but at length, several of the menbeginning to lag, the chace was only maintainedby four, who kept so nigh him, as to have himin view the greatest part of the day. In the even¬ing he hid himself in a knot of furze, about halfa mile from a small village, where several of his15friends Jived, intending to convey himself thitherin the ni^h', expecting thit the soldiers wouldhave searched the village before it grew dark;but here he was entirely mistaken, for his pur¬suers upon losing sight of him, suspected that hehad hid himself, and waited near the place untilthe whole company came up and then made adiligent search, but to no purpose. Upon thisthey held a fresh consultation, nor many yardsfrom the place where Redmond lay, and conclud¬ed to He under cover till morning. Redmondoverheard the discourse, and was resolved to stealaway, but was prevented by the men’s walkingto and fro, to keep themselves warm, until ob¬serving a smoke at a distance, they drew near,thinking to refresh themselves; but instead offinding one, they found a village ; where theywere furnished with fresh provisions. As theywere returning to renew the search, they observeda man at some distance, making to a cabin, whomthey pursued and found that they were still onthe right scent. But Redmond looking behindhim, though he was exceedingly hungry, alteredhis course, and the pursuit was renewed withgreat warmth, and he was obliged to hide him¬self next evening on the top ot a mountain, wherehe remained until break of day; and then he wentto one of his friend’s houses to get something toeat.At his coming up to the door, one of the dogsbegan to bark, which alarmed the pursuers to thecentre, jvho lay not far off; whereupon thev allcame up in a body and surrounded the house,just as Redmond sat down with a cake of bread,some butter, and a can of milk before him. Itwas now the third day fince he had eaten a mor-16sel, and heingj almost spent for want of food, wasjust going to put the first bit in his mouth, whenthe captain of the little army appeared at the door,with a very kind salutation, which Redmond re¬turned with a gentleman-like air, ‘ Mr O'Hanlon(said the officer.) I am glad we have overtakenyou ; we have been in pursuit of you near threedays, with the king’s warrant, and at last arecome up with you : now, sir, you are the king’sprisoner, get ready, for you must come alongwith us ’ Redmond replied, Sir, I acknowledgethat [am your prisoner, and shall comply withyour orders vnmedia'rely; but gentlemen, you havebeen hunting me these two days past, as I neverwas hunted in my life. I had not time to putone bit in my mouth, until now, and l beg, sir,you’ll just leave me to eat my last breakfast withmy friends; as soon as I have done you shallcarry me where vou please, and it will be no smallhonour to have the credit of taking Redmond©‘Hanlon, only don’t disturb me until lam ready.This privilege we readily granted him, and theofficer wuh eight men stood at the door, testingon their arms, while the other twelve guarded the -rhouse on rdl sides, without, until Redmond haddone, then he started up, taking his blunderbussin his hand, and presented it to the offider, saying,‘ now you take me for ycur prisoner, hut youmust give me a little play, that the world shouldnot have it to say that L was taken so silly, youbear the title of captain, so do 1; if you refuseto give me horse room and car room, I’ll dischargemy piece at you this instant, 1 expect nothingbut death, geurlerhen, but I am resolved to havefair play, and d>e honourably; and perhaps I’llmake three or four of you bear me company ; for17to gaol I ncvet will go alive-.* This hnguag*.surprised the officer, who seemed to give way ?.little, as though he had a mind to consent ■, upon-which, Redmond forced out of the door and £3-I taped.I It was about tl 's time that Power, the greatest; robber in Munster, took a journey to the countycl Armagh, to &ee Redmond, of whom he had| heard many fine stories. When he came near thtrplace of Redmond’s abode, he put up at an imr,and observing a gentleman, as he thought, tellingi over a good sum of money, he fcck care to bdinformed which road he intended to take in thumorning; upon which he purs red and overtook| him at the side of a wopd. At coming up he de¬manded the money, which he told him he sawhim reckoning the night before. The ether tcMi him he had money sure enough, but swore who¬ever took it should tight for it ; upon which each{ of the n discharged a pistol without any damage,! and then drew tbeir swords, with which theyfought some time on horseback ; at length look-j iug on one another, they forebore awhile, andagreed to right and define the quarrel on foot:having alighted the victory was contended for withequal brave.y and loss blood on both sides, an-! til ffiey wore able to, fight no longer : then sittingj duwn to rest, ‘pray,’ says the .Hampton of thenorth, ‘who, are you, and what’s your name!*Upon this, the other confessed he was the chiefrobber of Munster, who hearing a great deal ofRedmond O’rlanlan’s fame, came purposely toget acquainted with him. Savs Redmond, ‘thenyou have satisfied, your curiosity, for 1 am theman ; and l must confess you are the heartiest lad1 ever met with—I never was so worsted before.’18So they kissed and became friends, and he made aleague to tarry with Redmond a year and a halfin the north ; but not relishing bannocks and oat¬meal, he returned and surveyed only the Munsterroads afterwards.Before he departed they made a truce, and pro¬mised to give one another notice if at any timeeither ot them was put in prison, or in distress,that the one at liberty might rescue the other ifpossible. And soon after this the Munster torywas put in Clonmel goal, for murdering a travel-ler, on Kilnagowna, near the place where PatrickSarsfield afterwards had the fortune to blow upKing William’s artillery, and nail down the can¬non. According to their compact he wrote a let¬ter to Redmond, which he communicated to histrusty comrad«s, Patrick Mactigh, John Reily,&han Bernagh, Phil (ialloge, Pat O'Meel, JohnO’Neal, Barney Kellaughin, Paddy Mulligan,Billy Glengore, the famous O’Dale, and thegreat spindle shanked Thaddy O’Murray, theytook the affair into consideration; but the timebeing very short, Redmond posted away alone,and only reached to Clonmel the evening beforethe Munster champion was led out to Kilnagow-na, to be executed -, being in the habit of a gen¬tleman, he found means of communicating withPower, telling him he intended to set the townon fire in several places that night, that ydiile thepeople were in confusion he might have an oppor¬tunity of executing his design; but Power let himknow the danger of such an attempt, while astrong guard of soldiers were kept in the town,and dissuaded him from it by telling him of amuch better opportunity that would offer on theroad the next day, there being but a file or two of19four soldiers with the sheriff to guard him: andso put him in a way of forming a probable strata¬gem for making a rescue. Next morning theguard set ont with the prisoner, and having con¬ducted him about half way, they stopped awhileat a public house, on the road, to refresh them¬selves. The prisioner was left in a small room atone end of the house, under the charge of foursoldiers, while the soldiers sat in a larger room,at the other end, over a sup of liquor. Whilethey sat in this posture, Redmond appeared atthe door in the dress of a gentleman, and havingenquired the cause of the soldiers being there, hedesired to see the prisoner, which being grantedto him, he caHed for wine, to treat the men andpaid the whole reckoning. This being over, theofficer called for more wine to treat the gentle¬man, while the men were plied with liquor, bvRedmond’s private orders, to facilitate his design.As soon as he thought convenient, he stepped outon pretence of making water, and looking roundabout to see whether the coast was clear, he ob¬served eight men riding towards him, and foundthey were some of his own comrades, who hadfrllowed to assist him. His comrades could notmeet him in a more welcome time they consultedthe manner of executing their design, and hadthe luck to rescue Power as lol'ows; one of thegang held the horses at the end of the house,whilst the rest followed Redmond into it, whoopening a door that was in the passage, to preventany in the lower room from looking up into theother, stood there and made some kind of a noire,not only to drown the voice cf those with theprisoner during the scuffle, but to hinder the o-thers from coming out to see what the matter was.20*£ there arose any ■suspicion. In the mean time,,seven of the north-country robbers entered intothe little room, and taking advantage of the smallguard, dispatched fhe four men so suddenly thatthey had no time to cry out; and having cut thecords wherewith the prisoner was bound, Powermounted ©:se cf the horses, and mado his escapeto the mountains. Redmond himself was thef;rot who g've notice of the escape, and assisted4he sheriff, i« pursuing the robbers for severalmiles, until! finding an-opportunity in rhe evenurg,he turned off short, and followed his comradesdirectly to Lc ngford pass near the hog of Allan.When the soldiers, in ihf barrack erected atCarradelvm h-<d marched out of their quartersand fresh ©ties had supplied their room, Redmondtook out wi'h him eighteen men, and went in thenight to the barrack, to be revenged on the sol-,disrs for the severe hunting he got when he vnadehis surprising escape, it seems the soldiers wereall asleep otherwise it appears improbable thatthe Raparees could open the door, and steal awayeighteen .horses, unknown to the guard. How¬ever, the ei -hieen OHanlonians made off witheighteen horsds to B.dlibey, where there stood anold cattle in a valey, at the foot of a great hill.Here thoy alighted to reconnoitre the army.How the robbery was discovered is not known,but this is the tact ? eighteen horsemen began thepursuit early in the morning, and following; thetracks of the horses, came within sight of them; iabout nine o’clock in the morning, in the valleyaforesaid. As soon as captain O* Hanlon perceivedthe pursuers, he ordered Ids men to draw up thehorhes into a half-moon. His reason for makingout the circle was. that his men might keep the j|21lace of the IiaJf-rr.oon ‘rill towards his enemy ?ecause he k&ew %'ery well the dragoons did notlutsue then-., w ith an intent to , kill their ownjiorses.In this postare, they were just by the side of aRrge trench, when the oincer c^rne within shot;Captain Q Hanlon gave the officer a fair challenge,|ither to decide the inattef by a field battle, or toWye three guineas i-pie«e for th - horses ; but tlieiiffer was rejccred. Redmond observing and fear-ng that the footmen would find a passage overhe trench, thought proper to make a moderatejfi'er, which was to return the horses at a-guineai-piece, and to be allowed to withdraw unmolest¬ed: if this were refused, he swore that every marlihe had should fire upon the soldiers. This anda-jciouss challenge occasioned a council of waf to bejheld, wherein it was concluded to give him the(last demand, so a messenger was sent wjt’i the(money, which when captain OKanlon had re¬ceived, he and his men retired beheld'the trench,(which was before unperceived by ^(Ftcer, v.mo| otherwise, upon an eari fr discovery, might have[macle Redmond a pnroneb DiUh this surpris¬ing adventure ended without striking a blow.This la** adtion of Redmond's incensed thegovernment to the highest degree, and a freshproclamation was issued out, offering a rewardof L.400 or more, for his head; dead or alive,and L.40 a-piece, for the eighteen men that v/trswith him. The family of the Coot's, at CootsHill, were very active and Stfbpf'ssful in fakinghis comrades, as likewise th‘e JbhnstcnV of theFews; and in a few years, the most of fiVcJueTmen were executed, except Reilly who fled forhis life to France, where the1 same Coote having22killed A man in fighting a duel, contrary to thelaws of the nation, was tried and found guilty .Reilly came to him, and told him he was thencome vo render good for evil * and accordinglyhelped him to make his escape to Ireland again.While Redmond resided near Allen, Kelly, Iwith two or three green horn Rapperees, beseta house in the county of Kildare, and having ahole made in the wall, through which the whey iwas usually conveyed into the swine trough, the iservant maid had occasion to go into the dairy, |and observing that the hole was somewhat widerthan before, mistrusted that all was not right.Upon this, she took up a large cleaver, and con¬veyed herself to the side of the hole. When allwas hushed, the hands fell to work again, to pickout the stones of the wall, and made the holewider, and presently came in a head and shoulders,which the girl perceived, and making ready togive him a stroke, the fellow called to his com¬rades to bring him back,- but the girl had takencare to lighten the load, by cutting off the head,which terrified the rest without so much, thatthey fled for the same, and nobody came after--wards to challenge the dead, neither was it knownwho he was. But now to return to Redmondand finish his lifeThe vigilent Mr. Johoston seldom let Redmondrest, after his chief comrades were cut ofl', buthunted him over hiils and dales; but more par¬ticularly once, having notice that he was at Nar¬row Water, *ook some men and pursued him hotfoot almost to Carling'ord, whore his passageswere ail intercepted, which Redmond observing,he made to an alehouse by the river side, at whichtime it happened there Was no boat near hand.23nor bridge within a mile and a half of the place.Johnston got notice of it, and thinking it rot pos¬sible for Redmond to escape over so broad a riverwhile the tide was in. When old Johnston andmen came near, Redmond took to the river, andswam down under water. Ihis prevented himfrom receiving the shot of his pursuers, and whenJohnston set his dog after him, to seize him, thedog inapt at the coat, and Redmond held himunder water till he drowned him; and in a littletime he gained the bank on the other side of theriver, and fled directly to Island Magee, nearBelfast, where he lurked for a year, and thencame up to the county of Armagh, to make newadventures, but did not reign long.He w'as now under more apprehensions of dangerthan ever, yet, he fell desperately in love withan inn-keeper’s daughter, whom he prevailedupon to yield to his lustful embraces, upon akind of a sham marriage. However, having spentmost of his time in her company, until her fatherhearing who he was, endeavoured to get her tobetray him; but it only gave Redmond warningto conceal himself with more caution. But atlength one Douglas, a minister, knowing shewas brought up a protestant, and that Redmondwent to hear mass, thought that she might makea discovery: hut all his endeavours seemed to befruitless, until Redmond took some occasion toabuse her •, then Douglas at last obtained his end.ri he young woman took an opportunity to send amessenger to Douglas, and gave him notice w hereRedmond was, just as he was going into bed,after a hard fit of dr inking, in a little time aguard came up and took him asleep, and he washurried to Armagh gaol, with about twelve stone24of irons upon him, where he remained til! theassizes, and being tried, was found guilty of sucha number of facts, that he was condemned, aridhis body ordered to be cut into fear quarters,arid to be hung up in different places, as a terrorto others, notwithstanding which, he gave threesurprising jumps in court, to show his activity,though so heavily loaded with irons.However, it is said that he was afterwards eitherenlarged, or made his escape out of prison ; forhe died at last by the hands of one of his own re¬lations, who, foi the sake of the large reward,(offered for Redmond’s head,) caused his wife tplay a wfte for ',niu, and she having betrayed himunder a pretence of giving him some refreshment,^ie being weary stretched himself down to rest,and was shot through the head as he lay asleepin a barn. He that shot him had the head car¬ried on a staff to Armagh, and got the thanks ofthe whole country, besides the reward, at theensuing quarter sessipns.Thus ended the memorable life of that noto¬rious highwayman and robber, Redmond 0‘Han-lon, whose exploits make as remarkable a historyas any of the Irish giants.F INI $. ■

infamous,Long, long will the world remember thy crimes.Thrice ten human l/eings, weep all you who hear it,Were caught in his snares, and destroy’d in his denThe shades of thy victims may chide thy vile spirit,() Burke cruel monster thou basest of men.The weary, the old and the way faring stranger.Were woo'd by his kindness and led to his door,But little knew they that the path led to danger,0 little knew' they that their wanderings were e’er.Little knew they that the beams of the morning,To wake them to brightness, would shine all in vain,And little their friend knew, who watched their returning1 hat they v, ere ne’er more to return back again.-O gather the bones of the murderd together,And gave them a grave in some home of the dead,That their poor weeping friends with sad hearts may gothither,And shed tears of sorrow above their cold bed.Ye great men of learning, ye fiends of dissection,Who travell’d thro’ blood to the temple of gbin,And bought human life for your hateful inspection,O give the poor friends the white b >nes of the slain.3But woe to ihe riches and skill thus obtained,Woe to the wretch that would injure the dead,And voe to his portion whose lingers are stainedWith the red drops of life that he cruely shed.Tho’ Burke has been doom'd to expire on the gallows.The vilest that ever dishonoured the tree,Yet some may survive him whose hearts are as call on-',I O, who will be safe if the tigers be free.J Let none e’er reside in the crime marked dwellings,fjiFor ever disgraced by Burke and by Hare,'(May the cold damp of horror lie dark on their ceiling's.I And their pale ghastly walls still be dismal and bare.i Let their guilt and their gloom speak of nothing but terrorIt Some dark deeds of blood to the stranger declare,SAnd ages to come ever mark them with horror,Tor the ghosts of the murdered will still gather there.Brave Sesher Rah that lived in Grief,A bonny bonny lassie came to buy some beef,He took her in his arms and down she

dead,I mean for to alter my life,And place a good one in her stead.I do weary myself every day,A travelling from day light till gloaming,Lassies I’m greatly astray,Ihe n ay to find out a good woman,I fear there is dew to he had.I dent wish for one that has gold,Nor one that was brought up in a city,1GREAT NEED OF A MTI'E,6V-%I never will marry a scold,Nor one wlio does think herself |jretty.For a beauty’s infected with pride,And a scolding w ife is a heart-breaking,Before to a scold I'd he tied.I’d suffer with hugs to be eaten,For jarring I cannot abide,Iwdon’t wish to wed one that’s young,For fear she would crown me with horns.To take one that’s both deaf and dumb,\\ onld be a worse plague than the corns.I’ll not take a wife that is tall,Nor one that’s possess'd of great riches,A wee wife's the worst one of all.Because she would contend for the breechesO, that would soon shorten my days 1I never will marry a lass,That’s given too much unto pleasure,Nor one that’s too fund of a glass,Who throws up the finger at leisure,The one to work would not incline.Still rigging herself in the fashion,Do but keep the other from wine,You’ll see how she will fly in a passion,Fler temper the de'il could not Lear,I would like for to wed .an old maid,Whose age is about six and twenty,But I cannot find one I’m afraid,For notv-a-days they’re very scanty, ■7A widow I never will take,J 'll teli you wliat is my objection,Because tliat my beart she would break,Telling me of her husband’s perfections,So none of your widows for me.King Solomon, though lie was wise,It’s women they proved his undoing,And Samson the strong man likewise,Deliah she proved his ruin,My song it is nearly done,I’ll take a wee drop of the bottle,And women I’ll take in their turn,As oticc did the famed Aristotle,Who knew more of women than me.LOGAN BRAES.Logan, sweetly didst thou glidelatday 1 was my Willie’s bride ;id years sinsyne have o’er us run,ke Logan to the simmer sun.it now thy flowery hanks appear,-e drumlie \t inter, dark* and drear,ile my dear lad maun face his faes,r, ft*r frae me and Logan braes.8Again the merry mounth o’ MayHave made our hill and valleys gay ;The birds rejoice in leafy bowers,The bees hum round the breathing flowerBlythe morning lifts his rosy eye,And e’oning’s tears are tears of joy:My soul delightless a’ surveys,While Willie’s far frae Logan braes.Within yon milk white hawthorn bush,Amang "her nestlings sits the thrush ;Her faithfu* matewill share her toil,Or wi’ his song her cares beguile :But I, \vi’ my sweet nurselings here,Nae mate to help, nae mate to cheer,Bass wi low’d nights and joyless day,While Willie’s far frae Logan braes.O wae upon you men o’ state,That brethren rouse to deadly hate !As ye make mony a fond heart mourn,Sue'may it on your heads return !Ho w can your tiinty hearts enjoyThe widow’s tears,‘the orphan’s cry ?B it soon may peace bring happy days,And Wdue ham ' to Logan braes.

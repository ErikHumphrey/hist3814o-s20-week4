Bill,Hark ! don’t ye hear it roar, now ?Lord help them, how I pity’s allUnhappy folks on shore now.Fool-hardy chaps who live in town,What dangers they are bawling.And now are quaking in their bedsFor fear the roof should fall in.Poor creatures, how they envies us.And wishes (I’ve a notion)For our good luck in such a storm,To be upon the ocean.But as for them who're out all day.On business from their houses, .And late at night are coming home.To cheer their babes and spouses ;While you avid I, Bill, on the deck,Are comfortably lying.My eyes, what tiles and chimney-pots.About their heads are flying.And often have we seamen heard,How men are kill’d and undone.By overturns of carriages,By thieves and fires in London ;We know what risks all landsmen run.From noblemen to tailors,Then, Bill, let us thank ProvidenceThat you and I are sailors.THE WONDERFUL NOSE.A curious talc I now will disclose.Concerning a man with a very long nose!Like an elephant’s trunk it reach’d to his toes.And with it could deal out some terrible blows.Ri too ral, &o.This wonderful nose he could swing left and right.Which you all must allow look’d a comical sight;No one dare come near him, so great was his might—A blow from his nose would settle ’em quite.This terrible chap was about nine feet high,With a comical squint, and a mouth all awry ;Though bandy his legs, his heels were so light,: He’d just give a spring, and jump out of sight.jl The hair on his head sprouted out like a leek,|!And whenever he spoke, ’twas a kind of a squeak ;|He would oft with his nose toss up men for a freak,}!And they never came down ’tis said for a week.HThis chap wore a hat, in shape like a basin,i'With a brim wide enough for a donkey to race on,lAnd such a deuce of a fellow was he to take snuff,IA pound at a pinch was hardly enough.IA party of nobles once travell’d incog.To catch just a glimpse of this troublesome dog ;:But the breath from his nose had caused such a fog,.They tumbled head foremost bang into a bog.8At last came a sailor, with courage in store,Who swore he would tackle this long-snouted bore !Eut the nose made him jump like a grim pantaloon.And toss’d him so high, he went bang through themoon!The people around were gaping with fear,When they saw the poor sailor his course upwards steer,So they took to their heels, and made the coast clear,For the force of the nose made him feel very queer!The country was fill’d with wonder and dread,So the king at last set a price on his head ;And so loud did he snore, at night when in bed,’Twas said if he lived he would soon wake the dead!Some guards from the king at last made a gap,Through the doors of the house of this terrible chap ;•They found him in bed, just taking a nap,With the nose round his head in place of a cap.They crept one by one, tip toe on the floor,I think that in all there was near sixty score ;They tried to secure him—but mark, what a bore,He jump’d through the roof, and was never seen more.The soldiers were all of them struck with affright.When they saw Mr. Nosy cut clean out of sight;And so angry were they he had taken his flight,They set to and pummell’d each other all night 1

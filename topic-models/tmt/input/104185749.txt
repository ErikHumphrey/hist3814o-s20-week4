Every body knows,that the ladies in Spain, in certain cases, do notgive long warning to practitioners of a certaindescription, and nobody knew it better than Ni¬colas, who was resolved not to lose an inch ofhis way, nor of his mule’s best speed by the way,if cudgelling could beat it out of her. Jt wasplain to Nicolas’s conviction, as plain could be,that his road lay straight forward to the littleconvent in front; the mule was of opinion, thatthe turning on the left down the hill towards thePrado, was the road of all roads most familiar1and agreeable to herself, and accordingly beganto dispute the point of topography with Nicolas,by fixing her forefeet resolutely in the ground,dipping her head at the same time, betweenthem, and launching heels and crupper furiouslyinto the air, in the way of argument. LittlePedrosa, who was armed at heel with one massysilver spur, of stout though ancient workman¬ship, resolutely applied the rusty rowel to the3Itshoulder of his beast, and at the same lime,adroitly tucking his blue cape under his rightarm, and flinging his skirt over his left shoulderen cavalier, began to lay about him with a stoutashen sapling, upon the ears, pole, and checks, ofthe recreant mule. The fire now flashed from apairof Andalusian eyes, asblack as charcoal, andnot less inflammable, and taking the segarafromhis mouth, with which he had vainly hoped tohaveregaled his nostrils in a sharp winter’s even¬ing by the way, raised such a thundering troopof angels, saints, and martyrs, from Saint Mi¬chael, downwards, not forgetting his own name¬sake St Nicolas de Tolentino, by the way, thatif curses could have made the mule to go, thedispute would have been soon ended ; but not asaint could make her stir any other ways thanupwards and downwards at a stand. A smalltroop of mendicant friars were at this momentconducting the host to a dying man.—‘ NicolasPedrosa,’ says an old friar, ‘ bejratient with yourbeast, and spare your blasphemies; rememberBalaam.’ —‘ Ah ! father,’ replied Pedrosa, ‘ Ba¬laam cudgelled Ins beast till she spoke, so will Imine till she roars.’—‘Fie, fie, prophane fellow,’cries another of the fraternity. ‘ Go about yourwork, friend,’ quoth Nicolas, ‘and let me goabout mine: I warrant it is the more pressing ofthe two; your patient is going out of the world,mine is coming into it.’ ‘ Hear him,’ cries athird, ‘ hear the vile wTretch hew he blasphemes| the body of God.’ And then the troop passedslowly on to the tinkling of the bell.A man must know nothing of a mule’s ears,/who does not know what a passion they hfl>ro forthe tinkling of a bell; and no sooner had thejingling chords vibrated in the sympathetic or¬gan’s of Pedrosa’s beast, than bolting forwardwith a sudden spring, she ran roaring into thethrong of friars, trampling on some, and shoul¬dering others, at a prophanerate; when Nicolasavailing himself of the impetus, and perhaps notable to controul it, broke away, and was out otsight in a moment. ‘ All the devils in hell blowtire into thy tad, thou beast ot loabylon, mut¬tered Nicolas to himself, as he .scampered along,never once looking behind him, or stopping toapologise for the mischief he had done to toe barefeet and shirtless ribs ot the holy brotherhood.Whether Nicolas saved Ids distance, as like¬wise, if he did, whether it was a male or a fe¬male Castilian he ushered into the world, weshall not just now enquire, contented to awaitIds returndn the first of the morning, next oa\,when he had no sooner dismounted at his shop,and delivered his mule to a sturdy Arragouesewench than Don Ignacia de Santos Aparicio,Alguaztl-mayor of the supreme and general in¬quisition, put an order into his hand, signeu and ,sealed by the inquisitor-general, lor the convey¬ance of Ids body to the Casa, whose formidal)ie Idoor presents itself in the street adjoining to the |square in which Nicolas s brazen basin hung nforth, the emblem of bis trade.The poor lit tie fellow, trembling in every joint, fland with a face as yellow as saffron, dropt a knee jjto the altar which'fronts the entrance, and crus- ased himself most devoutly ; as soon as he had as-IT;5» cended the first flight of stairs, a porter liabitedI in black opened the tremendous barricade, andNicolas, with horror, heard the grating of thei heavy bolts that shut him in. He. was ledthrough passages, and vaults, and melancholy: cells, till he was delivered into the dungeon,where he was finally left to his solitary medica¬tions. Hapless being ! what a scene ol horror !I Nicolas felt all the terrors of his condition, but: being an Andalusian, and, like his countrymen,i of a lively imagination, he began to turn overallI the resources of his invention for some happyl! fetch, if any such might occur, for helping him| out of the dismal limbo he w'as in ; he had notjj long to seek for the cause of his misfortune : hissi adventure with the barefooted friars was a readyst solution of all difficulties of that nature, had therei been any; there was, however, another thing| which might have troubled a stouter heart thanI Nicolas’s—he .was a Jew. This, of a certainwould have been a staggering item in a poor| devil’s confession, but then it was a secret to allthe world but Nicolas, and Nicolas’s consciencedid not then urge him to reveal it. He now be-; gan to overhaul the inventory of his personalsI about him, and with some satisfaction countedthree little medals of the blessed virgin, twok Agnus Deis,’a Saint Nicolas de Tolentino, and5 a formidable string of beads, all pendant from1 his neck, and within his shirt; in his pockets, hehad a paper of dried figs, a small bundle of se-gars, a case of lancets, squirt and forceps, and1 two old razors in a leather envelope ; these heI had delivered one by one to the alguazil, who6first arrested him—‘ and let him make the mostof them;’ said he to himself, ‘ they can neverprove an Israelite by a case of razors.’ Upon acloser rummage, however, he discovered in asecret pocket, a letter, which the Alguazil hadoverlooked, and which his patient Donna Leon¬ora de Casafonda had given him in charge to de¬liver as directed.—‘ Well, well,’ cried he, ‘letit pass ; there can be no mystervin this harmlessscrawl, a letter of advice to some ftiend or rela¬tion ; I’ll not break the sea! ; let thefathers readit if they like, ’twill prove the truth of my de¬position, and help out my excuse for the hurryof my errand, and the unfortunate adventure ofa damned refractory mule.’—And now no soon¬er had the recollection of the wayward mule cros¬sed the brain of poor Nicolas Pedrosa, than hebegan to blast her at a furious rate. ‘ 1 he scrat¬ches and the scab to boot confound thy scurvyhide’, quoth he, ‘ thou ass-begotten bastard,whom Noah never let into his ark ! The Ven¬geance take thee, for an uncreated barren beastof promiscraotis generation ? What devil’s crot¬chet got into thy capricious noddle, that thousbouldst fall in love with that Nazaritish bell,and run bellowing like Lucifer into the midst ofthose barefooted vermin, who are more malici¬ous and more greedy than the locusts of Egypt?Oh ! that I had Uie art of Simon Magus to con¬jure thee into this dungeon in my stead; but Iwarrant thou art chewing thy barley straw with¬out any pity for thy wretched master, whom thyjade’s tricks have delivered bodily tothetormen- iftors, to be sport for these uneireumcised sous of ||l)l■JJ>(S'111’llaDagon.’ And now the cell door opened, whena savage figure entered, carrying a huge parcelof clanking fetters, with a collar of iron, whichhe put round the neck of Poor Pedrosa, tellinghi n, with a truly diabolical grin, whilst he wasri.etting it on, ‘that it was a proper cravat forih; throat of a blasphemer.’—‘Jesus Maria l’>ji oth Pedrosa, 4 is all this fallen upon me foronly cudgelling a restive mule?’ ‘Aye,’ criedihe-demon, ‘ and this is only a taste of what istci come,’ at the same time, slipping his pincersfi mi the screw he was forking to the head, hec ught a piece of flesh in the forceps,and wrench*c 1 it out of his check, laughing at poor Nicolas,whilst he roared aloud with the pain, telling him,it was a just reward for the torture he had puthim to a while ago, when he tugged at a toothtill he broke it in Ids jaw.’ ‘Ah, for the loveo I heaven,’cried Pedrosa, ‘ have more pity onme; for the sake of Saint Nicolas de Tolentino,my holy patron, be not so unmerciful to a poorbarber-surgeon ; and I will shave your worship’sbeard for nothing as long as I hav® life.’ One ofthe messengers of the auditory now came in, andbade the fellow strike oft'the prisoner’s fetter.,for that the holy fathers were in council, and de¬manded him for examination. ‘ This is some¬thing extraordinary,’ quoth the tormentor, ‘Ishould not have expected it this twelvemonth tocome.’ Pedrosa’s fetters were struck oft ; somebrandy wasapplied to staunch thebleedmg of hischeek ; his hands and face were washed, and ashort jacket of course ticking thrown over him ,and the messenger, w’ith an assistant, taking himseach under an arm, led him into a spacious cham¬ber, where at the head of a long table sat his ex¬cellency the Inquisitor general with six of ids as¬sessors, three on each side of the chair of state:the alguazil-mayor, a secretary, and two notaries,with other-officers of the holy council, were at¬tending in their places.The prisoner was placed behind a bar at thefoot of the table, between the messengers whobrought him in ; and having made his obeisanceto the awful presence, in the most supplicatingmanner, he was called upon, according to theusual form of questions, by one of the juniorjudges, to declare his name, parentage, profes¬sion, age, place of abode, and to answer variousinterrogatories, of the like trifling natm ef his ex¬cellency the Inquisitor-general now opened hisreverend lips, and in a solemu tone of voice thatpenetrated to the heart of the poor tremblingprisoner, interrogated him as follows:Nicolas Pedrosa, we have listened to tho ac¬count you give of yourself, your business and con¬nections; now tell us for what offence or offen¬ces, you are here standing a prisoner before us:examine your own heart, and speak the truthfrom your conscience without prevarication ordisguise.May it please your Excellency replied Pedro¬sa, with all due submission to your holiness andthis reverend assembly, my most equitable judges,I conceive I stand here before you for no worsea crime than that of cudgelling arefractory mule,an animal so restive in its nature, (under correc¬tion of your holiness be it spoken,) that although9I were blessed with the forbearance of holy Job,(for like him too I am married, and my patiencehath been exercised by a wife,) yet could 1 notforbear to smite my beast for her obstinacy, andthe rather because I was summoned in the wayof my profession, as 1 have already made knownto your most merciful ears, upon a certain cry¬ing occasion, which would not admit of a mo¬ment’s delay.Recollect yourself, Nicolas, said his Excellen¬cy the Inquisitor-general ; was there nothingelse you did, save smiting your beast ?I take Saint Nicolas de Tolentino to witness,replied he, that I know of no other crime, forwhich I can be responsible at this righteous tri¬bunal, save smiting my unruly beast. Take no¬tice, brethren, exclaimed the Inquisitor, this un¬holy wretch holds trampling over friars to be nocrime.Pardon me, holy father, replied Nicolas, I holdit for theworst of crimes, and therefore willinglysurrender my refractory mule to be dealt with asyou see fit; and if you impale her alive, it willbe no more than she deserves.Your wits are too nimble, Nicolas, cried thejudge; have a care they do not run away withyour discretion ; recollect the blasphemies youuttered in the hearing of those pious people.I humbly pray your Excellency, answered theprisoner, to recollect that anger is a short mad-nesss, and I hope allowances will be made byyour holy' council for words spoke in haste to arebelliohsmule ; the prophet Balaam was thrownoff his guard by a simple as*, and what is an asa10compared to a mule ? If ^our Excellency hadseen the lovely creature, that was screaming inagony till I came to her relief, and how fine aboy I ushered into the world, which would havebeen lost but for myassistance, I am sure I shouldnot be condemned for a few hasty words spokenin passion.Sirrah ! cried one of the puisny judges, res¬pect the decency of the court. Produce thecontents of this fellow’s pockets before the courtsaid the President; lay them on the table.Monster, resumed the aforesaid puisny judge,taking up the forceps, what is the use of thisdiabolical machine ? Please your reverence,replied Pedrosa, ‘ aqhim est ad extrahendosfeetwi.—Unnatural wretch, again exclaimed thejudue, ypu have murdered the mother.The mother of God forbid! exclaimed Pedro-»sa. I believe I have a proof in my pocket thatwill acquit me of that charge: and so saying, hetendered tlie letter we have before made mentionof. The secretary took it, and by command ofthe court read as follows: —“ Senior Don Manuel de Herrara,“ When this letter, which I send by NicolasPedrosa, shall reach your hands, you will knowthat I am safely delivered of a lovely boy, aftera dangerous labour, in consideration of which Ipray you to pay to the said Nicolas Pedrosa thesum of twenty gold pistoles, which sum his Ex¬cellency—,”Hold, cried the Inquisitor-general, startinhastily from his seat, and snatching away thelet-ter, there it more in this than meets the eye,11break up the court; I must take aa examina¬tion of that prisoner in private.As soon as the room was cleared, the Inquisi¬tor-general, beckoning the prisoner to followhim, retired into a private closet, where, throw¬ing himself carelessly into an arm chair, heturn-ed a gracious countenance upon thepooraff’right-cd accoucheur, and bidding him sit down upona low stool by his side, thus accosted him :—Take heart, Senior Pedrosa, your imprisonmentis not likely to be very tedious, lor 1 have a com-j mission you must execute without loss of time;j you have too much consideration for yourself tobetray a trust, the violation of which must in¬volve you in inevitable ruin, andean in no degreeattaint my character, which is far enough be¬yond the reach of malice ; be attentive, therefore,to my orders ; execute them punctually, and keepmy secretasyou tender your own life; dost thouknow the name and condition of the lady whomthou hast delivered? Nicolas assured him he! did not, and his excellency proceeded as follows:Then I tell thee, Nicolas, it is the illustriousDonna Leonora de Casafonda; her husband isthe president of Quito, and daily expected with;! the next arrivals from the South Seas; now,though measures have been taken for detaininghim at the port,' wherever he shall land, till hej shall receive further orders, yet you must besensi-ble Donna Leonora’s situation is somewhat deli-j cate; it will be your business to take the spee-! diest measure for her recovery ; but as it seemsshe has had a dangerous and painful labour, thismay be a work of more time than could be wish-; U rdVar! bun12ed, unless some medicines more efficacious thancommon are administered ; art thou acquaintedwith any such, friend Nicolas?—So please yourExcellency, quoth Nicolas, my processes havebeen tolerably successful ; I have bandages andcataplasms, with oils and conserves, that I haveno cause to complain of; they will restore natureto its proper state In all decent time.—Thou talk-est like a fool, friend Nicolas, interrupting him,said the Inquisitor ? What tellest thou me of thysvvathings and swaddlings ? quick work must bewrought by quick medicine: hast thou none suchin thy botica? I’ll answer for it thou hast not ?therefore, look you, sirrah, here is a little vialcompounded by a famous chemist; see that youmix it in the next apocem you administer toDonna Leonora; it is the most capital sedativein nature; give her the whole of it, and let herhusband return when he will, depend upon it hewill make no discoveries from her.—Humph!quoth Nicolas within himself, tvell said Inquisi¬tor ! He took the vial with all possible respectand was not wanting in professions of the mostinviolable fidelity and secrecy.— No more words,friend Nicholas, quoth the Inquisitor, upon thatscore; I do not believe thee one jot the more forall thy promises, my dependence is upon thyfears and not thy faith; I fancy thou hast seenenough of this place not to be willing to returnto it once for all ! Having so said, he rang abell, and ordered Nicolas to be forthwith liber¬ated, bidding the messenger return his clothesinstantly to him with all that belonged to him,and having slipt a purse into his hand well filled13Iiwith doubloons, he bade him begone about hisbusiness, and not see his face again till he hadexecuted his demands.Nicolas bolted out of the porch without takingleave of the altar, and never checked his speetltill he found himself fairly housed under shelterof his own beloved brass basin.—Alia! quothNicolas, my lord Inquisitor, I see the king isnot likely to gain a subjectmore by your intrigues,and a pretty job you have set me about; and so,when I have put the poor lady to rest with yourdamned sedative, my tongue must be stopt nextto prevent its blabbing : but I’ll shew you I wasnot born in Andalusia fornolhing. Nicolas nowopened a secret drawer, and took out a fewpieces of money, which, in fact was his wholestock of cash in the world ; he loaded and primedhis pistols, and carefully lodged them in thehoul-sters of his saddle! he buckled to his side histrusty spada,and hastened to caparison his mule.Ah, thou imp of the old one, quoth he, as heentered the stable, art not ashamed to look mein the face? But come, hussy, thou owest mea good turn, methinks-; stand by me this once,and be friends for ever ! thou art in good case,and if thou wilt put thy best foot foremost, likea faithful beast, thou shalt not want for barleyon the way. The bargain was soon struck be¬tween Nicolas and his mule, he mounted her inthe happy moment, and pointing his course to¬ward the bridge of Toledo, which proudly strideswith half a dozen lofty arches over a streamscarce three feet wide, he found himself as com¬pletely in si desatt in half a mile’s riding, -sif he14-« had been dropt in the centre of Arabia Petrsea.As Nicolas’s journey was not a tour of curiosity,he did not amuse himself with a peep at Toledo,or Talavcra, or even Merida, by the way : forthe same reason he took a circumbendibus roundthe frontier town of Badajoz; and crossing alittle brook, refreshed his mule with the lastdraught of Spanish water, and instantly congra¬tulated himself upon entering the territory ofPortugal. Brava ! quoth he, patting the neckof his mule, thou shalt have a supper this nightof the best sive-meat that Estramadura can fur¬nish : we are now in a country where the scat¬tered flock of Israel fold thick and fare well. Henow began to chaunt the song of Solomon, andgently ambled on in the joy of his heart.When Nicolas at length reached the city ofLisbon, he hugged himself in his good fortune;still he recollected that the Inquisition had longarms, and he was yet in a place of no perfectsecurity. Our adventurer had in early life actedas assistant-surgeon in a Spanish frigatebound toBuenos Ayres, and being captured by a Britishman of war, and carried into Jamaica, had veryquietly passed some-years in that place as jour¬neyman apothecary, in which time he had ac¬quired a tolerable acquaintance with the Englishlanguage. No sooner then did he discover theBritish ensign flying on the poop of an Englishfrigate then lying in the Tagus, than he eagerlycaught the opportunity of paying a visit to thesurgeon ; and finding he was in want of a mate,offered himself, and was entered in that capacityfor a cruize against the French and Spaniards,1Zdth whom Great Britain was then at war. Inthis secure asylum N'icolas enjoyed the first hap¬py moments he had experienced for a long timepast, and being a lively good-humoured littlefel-low, and one that touched the guitar and sungsequtdillas with a tolerable grace, he soon re¬commended himself to his ship-mates, and grewin favour with every body on board, from thecaptain to the cook’s mate.When they were out upon their cruise, hover¬ing on the Spanish coast, it occurred to Nicolas,that the Inquisitor-general at Madrid had toldhim of the expected arrival of the president ofQuito, and having imparted this to one of thelieutenants, he reported it to the captain ; anda« the intelligence seemed of importance, heavailed himself of it, by bawling into the trackof the homeward bound galleons, and great wasthe joy, when at the break of the morning themanat the mast-head announced a square-riggedvessel in view. The ardour of a chase now setall hands to work ; and a few hours brought themnear enough to discern that she was a Spanishfrigate, and seemingly from a long voyage: littlePedrosa, as alert as the rest, stript himself forhis work, and repaired lo his post in the cocta-pit, whilst the thunder of the guns reeled inces¬santly overhis head ; three.cheers from the wholecrew at length announced the moment of victory,and a few more minutes ascertained the goodnews, that the pr»e was a frigate richly ladenfrom the South Seas, with the governor of Quitoand his suite on board.Pedrosa was now called upon deck, and sent16on board the prize a* interpreter to the first lieu¬tenant, who was to take possession of her.— Hefound everything in confusion, a deck coveredwith the slain, and the whole crew in consterna¬tion at an event they were in no degree preparedfor, not having received any intimation of a war.He found the officers in general, and the passen¬gers without exception, under the most horridimpressions of the English, expecting to be but¬chered without mercy. Don Manuel de Casa-fond a, the governor, whose countenance bespokea constitution far gone in a decline, had thrownhimself on a sofa, in the last state of despair, andgiven way to an effusion of tears : when the litu-tenant entered the cabin, he rose trembling fromhis couch, and with the most supplicating actionpresented to him his sword, and with it a casketwhich he carried in his other hand : as he ten¬dered these spoils to his conqueror, whetherthrough his weakness, or of his own will, hemade a motion of bending his knee: the gener¬ous Briton, shocked at the unmanly overture,caught him suddenly with both hands,and turn¬ing to Pedrosa, said aloud,—Convince this gen¬tleman he is fallen into the hands of an honour¬able enemy.— Is it possible ! cried Don Manuel,and lifting up his streaming eyes to the counte¬nance ofthe British officer, saw humanity, valour,and generouspity, so strongly characterised in kisyouthful features, that the conviction was irre¬sistible. Will he not accept my sword? criedthe Spaniard. Pie desiresyou to wear it, till hehas the honour of presenting you to his captain.Ah ! then he has a captain, exclaimed Don Ma-17nucl, his superior will be of another way of|thinking; tel! him this casket contains my jew-I els ; they are valuable; let him present them asII a lawful prize, which will enrich the captor, hisi superior will not hesitate to take them from me.— Ifihey are your Excellency’s private property,replied Pedrosa, lam ordered to assure you, thatif your ship were loaded with jewels, no British! officer in the service of his king will take them! at your hands : the ship and effiects of his Catho-I lie Majesty are the only prize of the captors; the|i personals of the passengers are inviolate.—Gen-! erous nation 1 exclaimed Don Manuel, how; greatly have I wronged thee!—The boats of theI British frigate now came alongside, and part ofi the crew were shifted cut of the prize, takingI their clothes and trunks along with them, inwhich they were very cordially assisted by theirconquerors. The barge soon after came aboardwith an officer in the stern-sheets, and the crewin their white shirts and velvet caps, to escort thegovernor and the ship’s captain on board the fri-! gate, which lay -with hpr sails to the mast await¬ing their ftrrival: the accommodation ladder wassiting over the side, and manned for the prison¬ers, who were received on the gangway by thesecond lieutenant, whilst perfect silence and theJ strictest discipline reigned in the ship, where alli were under the decks, and no inquisitive curiouseyas were suffered to wound the feelings of theconquered even with a glance. In the door ofhis cabin stood the captain, who received themi with that modest complaisance, which does notrevolt the unfortunate by an overstrained polite*ISness: be was a man of Hie’h birth and elegantmanners, with a heart as benevolent as it wasbrave ; such an address, set off with a personfinely formed and perfectly engaging, could notfail to impress the prisoners with the most fav¬ourable ideas; arid as Don Manuel spoke Frenchfluently, he could converse with the British cap¬tain without the help of an interpreter ; as heexpressed an impatient desire of being admittedto his parole, that he might revisit his friendsand connections, from whom he had been longseparated, he was overjoyed to hear that theEnglish ship would carry her prize into Lisbon ;and that he would there be set on shore, and per¬mitted to make the best of his way from thenceto Madiid. He talked of his wife with all theardour of the most impassioned lover, and apo¬logised for his tears, by imputing'them to theagony of his mind and infirmity of his health ,under the dread of briing longer separated froman object so dear to his heart, and on whom hedoated with the fondest affection. The gener¬ous captain indulged him in these conversations,and being a husband himself, knew hoV to al¬low for all the tenderness of his sensations. Ah,Sir, cried Don Manuel, would to heaven it werein my power to have the honour of presentingmy beloved Leonora to y^u on our landing atLisbon—Perhaps, addedhe, turning to Pedrosa,who at that moment entered tliecabin, this gen¬tleman, whom I take to be a Spaniard, may haveheard thename ofDonna Leonora de Casafonda;if he has been at Madrid, it is possible he mayhave seen her | Should that be the case, he canII'■testify to her external .charms ; I alone can wit¬ness to the exquisite perfections of her mind.—Senior Don Manuei,replied Pedrosa, I have seenDonna Leonora, and your excellency is warrant¬ed in all you say in her praise; she is of incom¬parable beauty. These word's, threw the uxo¬rious Spaniard into raptures; his eyes sparkledwith delight; the blood rushed into Ins emaciat¬ed cheeky, and every feature glowed with unut-tei able joy; he pressed Pedrosa with a varietyof rapid inquiries, all which he evaded by plead¬ing ignorance, saying that he had only a casualglance of her, as she passed along the Prado,the embarrassment, however, which accompa¬nied these answers, did not escape the Englishcaptain, whp, shortly after, drawing Pedrosaaside into the surgeon’s cabin, was by him madeacquainted with the melancholy situation of thatunfortunate lady, and every particular of thestor y as before related : nay, the very vial wasproduced, with its contents, as put into the handsof Pedrosa by the Inquisitor.Can there be such villainy in man? cried theBritish captain, when Pedrosahad concluded hisdetail: alas ! my heart bleeds for this unhappyhusband ; assuredly that monster has destroyedLeonora; as for thee, Pedrosa, whilst the Brit¬ish flag flies over thy head, neither Spain, norPortugal, nor inquisitors, nor devils, shall annoythee under its protection ; but if thou ever ven¬tures!, over the side ot this ship, and ra-bly set-test thy foot upon Cathol ic soil, when we arriveat Lisbon, thou art a lost man.—I were worsethan a madman, replied Nicolas, should I »t-tempt it.—Keep close in this asylum, then, re¬sumed the captain, and fear nothing : had it beenour fate to have been captured by the Spaniard,what would have become of thee.— In the worstof extremities, replied Nicolas, I should haveapplied to the inquisitor’s vial; but I confess Ihad no fears of that sort; a ship so commandedand so manned is in little danger of being car-ried into a Spanish port.—-I hope not, said thecaptain, and I promise thee, thou shall take thychance in her as long as she is afloat under mycommand : and if we live to conduct her to Eng¬land, thou shall have thy proper share of prize-money, which, if the galleon breaks up accord¬ing to her entries, will be something towards*enabling thee to shift, and if thou art as diligentin thy calling, as I am persuaded thou wilt be»whilst I live thou shall never want a seaman’sfriends—At these cheering words, little Nicolasthrew himself at the feet of his generous preserv¬er, and, with streaming eyes, poured out histhanks from a heart animated with joy and gra¬titude.—The captain raising him by the hand,forbade him as he prized his friendship, evqf toaddress him in that posture any more : thank meif you will, added he, but thank me as one manshould another ; let no knee bend in this shipbut in adoration of God.—But now, continuedhe, let us turn our thoughts to the situation ofour unhappy Casafonda : we are rrow drawingnear Lisbon, where he will look to be liberated 'on his parole. By no means let him venture in¬to Spain, said Ped'osa : I am well assured there jare order* to arrest him in every port, or frontier jf21own, where he may present himself. I can well(relieve it, replied the captain; his piteous casewill require further deliberation; in the meani ime, let nothing transpire on your part; andveep yourself out of his sight as carefully as you:an.—This said, the captain left the cabin, and■ roth parties repaired to their several occupations.As soon as the frigate, and her prize, castanchor in the Tagus, Don Manuel de Casafondaf| impatiently reminded our captain of his promisediparole. The painful moment was now come,when an explanation of some sort become un-jivoidable: the generous Englishman, with a(countenance expressive of the tenderest pity, took(the Spaniard’s hand in his, and seating him ona couch beside him, ordered the sentinel to keepahe cabin private, and delivered himself as fol¬lows : —Senior Don Manual, I must now impart toyou an anxiety which I labour under on your ac¬count : I hare strong reasons to suspect you haveenemies in your own country, who are upon thejwarch to arrest you on your landing, when Ijjhave told you this, I expect you will repose suchtrust*in my honour, and the sincerity of my re¬gard fowyou, as not to demand a further expla¬nation of the particulars on which my intelligenceis founded.—Heaven and earth ! cried the as¬tonished Spaniard, who can be those enemies Ihave to fear, and what can I have done to de¬serve them ! So far I will open myself to you,answered the captain, ns to point out the princi¬pal to you, the Inquisitor-general. The bestfriend 1 have in Spain, exclaimed tlve governor,22my sworn protector, the patron of my fortune ;;he my enemy! impossible. Well Sir, repViettthe captain, if my advice do not meet belief, Imust so far exert my authority for your sake, a^jto make this ship your prison, till ] have waitedon our minister at Lisbon, and made the enqui¬ries necessary for your safety; suspend yourjudgment upon the seeming harshness of this;measure till I return to you again; and, at thdsame time, rising from his seal, he gave orders,for the barge; after leaving strict injunctionswith the first lieutenant not to allow of the gover¬nor’s quitting the frigate, he put off for the shore.The emissaries of the inquisition having at lasttraced Pedrosa, our captain had no sooner turn¬ed into the porch of the hotel of Buenos Ayres,than he was accosted by a messenger of state,with a requisition for tbe surrender of Pedrosa.As soon as the requisition was explained to ourworthy captain, he dispatched the midshipman,to make the best of bis way back to the frigate,and deliver a letter to the lieutenant; then turn¬ing to the messenger, he said, That Spaniard isnow borne on my books, and before you shalltake him out of the service of my king you must;sink his ship. He instantly proceeded to thehouse of the British Minister: here he foundPedrosa’s intelligence, with regard to the Gover¬nor, expressly verified.The generous captain lost no timein returningto his frigate, where he immediately imparted toDon Manuel the intelligence he had obtained atthe British Ministers. The proposal was nowsuggested, ofsending letters into Spain, and the2Si(governor retired to his desk for the purpose ofwriting them. In the afternoon of the same day,the minister paid a visit to the captain, and re¬ceived a packet from the hands of Don Manuel,promised to get it forwarded by a safe convey¬ance according to the direction., In the due course of time, this fatal letter fromLeonora opened all the horrible transaction tothe wretched husband : —“The guilty hand of an expiring wife, underthe agonizing operation of a mortal poison, tracesthese few trembling lines to an injured, wretched; husband. If thou hast any pity for my partingspirit, fly the ruin that awaits thee, and avoidthis scene of villainy and horror. 1 have born achild to the monster, whose poison runs in myf veins. The Inquisitor is my murderer—My; pen falls from my hand.—Farewell for ever !”Had a shot passed through the heart of DonManuel, it could not more effectually have stoptits motions than the perusal of that fatal writing :. he dropped lifeless on the couch, and but for thecare and assistance of the captain and Pedrosa,in that posture he had probably expired. Grieflike his cannot be described bywords, for towords it gave no utterance; ’twas suffocatingI silent woe.Let us drQfp the curtain over this melancholypause in our narration, and attend upon the< mournful widower, now landing upon Englishj ground, and conveyed by his humane and gener-ous preserver to the house of a noble Ear), thei father of onr amiable captain. At the period of| a few tranquillizing weeks, hete passed in the24.besom'of humanity, letters came to hand fromthe British Minister at Lisbon, in answer to amemorial, that I should have stated to have beendrawn up by the friendly captain before his de¬parture from that port. By these letters it ap¬peared, that the criminal was either no longerinexistence, or in a situation never to be heard ofany more, till roused by the awakening trump,he should be summoned to his tremendous lastaccount. As for the unhappy widower, it wasfully signified to him, from authority, that hisreturn to Spain, whether upon exchange or pa¬role, would be no lo'uger opposed ; nor had heanything to apprehend on the part of govern¬ment, when he should arrive there. The samewas signified in fewer words to the exculpatedPedrosa.Whether Don Manuel de Casafonda vill at afuture period, avail himself of the overtures timealone can prove: as for little Nicolas, whoseprize-money has set him up in acomfortabie littleshop in Duke’s-place, where he breathes theveins and cleanses the bowels of his Israelitishbrethren in a land cf freedom and toleration hismerry heart is at rest, save only when with firein his eyes, and vengeance on his tongue, heanathematizes the inquisition ; and struts in the:synagogue every Sabbath, with as bold a stepiand as erect a look, as if he was himself HighPriest of the Temple going to perform sacrificeupon the rc-assemblingof the scattered tribes.FINIS.I

BONNY JEANTo which are added,Tweedside.Jltkough my Mqg’s gi en me the bag,Samuel Macaree’s ghaist.STIRLING;Printed by W. Macnie.1824i.V tThere was a Lass.There was 0 lass, and she was lair,, At kirk or.market to be seen.When a’ the fairest maids were met,The fairest maid was bonny Jean.And ay she wrought her mammy’s wark.And ay she sung sae merrilie ;The blithest bird upon the bush,Had ne'er a lighter heart than she.But hawks will rob the tender j")y?,That bless the little lint-white’s nest ;And frost w 11 blight the fairest flowers,And love will break the soundest rest.Toung R^bie was the brawest lad,The flower and pride ef a’ the glen.And he had owsen, sheep, and kye,And wanton naigies nine or ten.fcre gaed wi’ Jeanie to the tryste, 4He danc’d wi’ Jeanie on the down ;And lang e’er witless Jeanie wistHer heart was tint, her peace was stewn.3As in the bosom o’ the stream,The moon-beam dwells at dewy e’en ;So; trembling, pure, vas tender love,Within the breest o’ bonnie Jean.And now she works her mammie’s wark,And ay she sigh* wi' grief and pain,Yet wist na what her ail might be,Or what wad mak her weel again.But didna Jeanie’s heart loup light,And didna joy blink in her c’e,As Robin tauld a t ile o’ love,Ae day upon the flowery lea.The sun was sinking in the west,The birds sang sweet in ilka grove,His cheek to hers he fondly prest,And whisper'd thus his tale ot love.0 Jsanie fair, l lo’e thee dear,O canst thou think to fancy me ?Or wilt thou leave thy raammie’s cot,And learn ;o tent the faims wi’ me?At barn or byre thou shall na drudge,Or naething else to trouble thee ;But stray amang the heather bells,And tent the waving corn wi’ me.4Now what could artless Jeanie do ?She had nae will to say him na :At length she blush'd a sweet consent,And ieve was ay atween them twa.Tweed-side.Waat beauties does Fiora disclose ?How sweet are her smiles upon Tweed !Yet Mary’s still sweeter than those,Where nature doth fancy exceed.No daisy, nor sweet-blushing rose,Ner a'l the gay flowers of the field,•Nor Tweed gliding gently thro' those,Such beauty and pleasure doth yield.The warblers are heard in the grove ;The linnet the lark, and the thrujh,The blackbird, and sweet cooing dove,With music enchant every bush.Come, let us gc forth to the mead,Let's see how the primroses spring,We'd lodge in some village on I weed,And love, while the feather'd folk singHow does my love pass the long dayDoes Mary not tend a few sheep ?srDo they never carelessly stray,While happily she lies asleep ?Tweed’s murmurs should lull her to rest;Kind nature indulging my bliss—To ease the soft pains of my breast,Td steal an embrosial kiss.Tis she does the virgins excel.No beauty.with her may compare ;Love’s graces around her do dwell;She's the fairest where thousands are fair.^Say, charmer, where do thy flocks stray ?Oh ! tell me at noon where they feed ?Shall 1 seek them on sweet-winding Tay,O-r the pleasanter banks of the Tweed ?Although my Meg's gie'n me the bag.Although my Meg’s gien me the bag.The fling, ot what d'ye ca’ that,An’ squares wi’ Jock, the Lunnonbuck,I’m ro to greet for a’ that;For a’ that, an’ a’ that,An’ twice as muckle’s a’ that,Though she be sweet, for kissing meet,A.n’ muckle mair than a* that.There’s niony a ane for less wad mane,fn drear kirk-yards an’ a’ t'uat,ad' tell the pale moon sic a tale,Wad break her heart an* a’ thatTill frae his wits like a’ that.He’d take a race wi* a’ that,Some gloamin’ grey, and fyle the Tay,Cheat fishermen, an’ a’ that.But by my sooth, I wad be laith.Sic pranks to play, an’ a’ that,Nor shall she boast that I hae lost,Ae hours repose for a’ that.She’s fair, but what o’ a’ that,There’s plenty mair wi' a’ that.That glad will be to mak wi’ me,A wedding o’t, an’ a’ thatSamuel Macaree’s Ghaist.Ths ten-hour bell wi’ heavy jow,Had rung in ilka borough town,The winds sough’d dreary o’er the knoweAnd night had on her blackest gown.As at the fire I sat aiane,Wi’ tears o’ sorrow i' my ee;7Thinking upon my dead and gane,Auld honest Samuel Macaree.The door, though locked firm and fast,Flew wi’ a clash against the wa*,Upstarting, round my looks I cast,When, saints and angels f what I saw,^Stood full before me, on the floor.Just clad as he was wont to be,But ah ! sae toom, sae pale and poor,Departed Samuel Macaree.“ Oh dread nae evil, he began,* lis nanc o’ Satan’s imps you see.For I’m the ghaist o’ thy guidman,Wha ne’er could think o’ harming thee ;But greet nae mair, if that ye, bearThe sma'est spark o’ love to me,For wil a-wa you’re wranging sair,The weary Samuel Macaree,My wynin’-sheet wi’ tears Js weet,I wander, restless, up and down,Maun traichel thro’ the wintry sleet,When ither ghaists are sleeping sound.This night I tried to get a nap,But scarce had clos’d my drowsy ee,When ye let fa’ a tnuckle drap,That waken’d Samuel Macaree.81’ve-lain a towmond in the ground,And yet ray grave has ne’er been green.While a’ around wi’ flowers abound,For this I hae to thank your een.What! wad you hae me come again ?Is aught in life sae sweet to prie ?A bitter draught o’ grief and pain,It prov’d to Samuel Macaree.Ere lang gae by we baith shall meet,An’ marry never to be twin’d—”Here down I fell to kiss his feet,But fient a foundit could I And,Nor saw him raair, but i' my ear,These words were harkit tenderly.—Adieu my Ann, to mourn forbear,Oh ! pity Samuel Macaree.”FINIS,*♦

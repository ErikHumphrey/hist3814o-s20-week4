Therefore, we havefurnifhed the public with a colledtion of old wivesnoted fayings and wonders.Two old wives, Maggy and Jamt, at thei:rocks, began their crack as follows :yan. A dear Maggy, how auld will ye be nowO it is lang fince I ken’d ye.Mag. Indeed Janet, that’s what naebody kensfor my parents had fae monyo us, they ne’er counted how auld ane o us was ; they minded aye wino us was born firft, and wha was neift ane anitherand that was a that eer we fought to ken about it,but I hae mind o the mirk Muonday.Jan.

But dear Janet, yere braw and lang o timemory, do ye mind o the.waefu blaft, when the foithief was raging in the air, and the deil dang down sthe kail-yard dykes, cutted thecorn ftacks, tirr'd thihoufes, and blew giddy Willy's wig in the wall ? thefaid fome young minifterhadraiVri thedeil, and fcwant o a cat, or fome unkirfen'd creature to gi hintthey eoudna get him laid again, an he brake thbridle, flipped his head, and ran awa frae them.Jan. Deed woman I heard tell o that; and hovWilly M'Neal met him on the flaps in the mids *the water, and fhot him o’er, and thought to drow:him, but he he gade down the water like a meiki..bill roaring. But I mind the fiift: time the de;came to this kintry was on a Sunday ; I vas a webit gaun lafiie; my father was at the kirk; there watwa o them, a hummel'd ar.e and a horn'd sne, ;( 5 )Ddman deil and a goodwife dcil; we ran a into theife, and my mither barr‘d the door, and hunteddogs out at the byre hole, thinking the deii1 rio frae the dogs; but na na. they gat upon theirend like twa auld men; they ware a nigh langr like a pyet horfe, wi lang be..rds aneath thtirn, and the meikle horn*>1 deil box'd the dogs inthe hole; we lan aben the houfe and grat ; butJock, wha vva a little g-’iin ’aodock, cried, ay,her, what is the deil feeking here? tie'll be want-to tak the auld wive and the cats to mak witch-i them.

ALETTERFrom a Gentleman in Glafgow to his Friend inConcerning the late Tumults which happened in thatCity, in the Year 1725, at the commencementA true Account of the Plundering of DanielCampbell of Shawfield’s houfe, the Mur¬der of the Inhabitants by Capt. Bufhell, the im-prifonment of the Magiftrates, and their Libera¬tion by order of the Lords of Judiciary.the Country.of the Malt Tax.CONTAINING,Printed in the Year 1774,A LETTERFrom a Gentleman in Clajgoiv, to his friend in thecountry^ concerning the late tumultsy that happenedin that city.ACCORDING to your defire, I bow fend you atrue and particular account of the diforders whichhappened in this place in the month of June laft, by whichyou will perceive that the accounts thereof publilhed inthe Edinburgh and London news-paper, are for the molipart faii'e. No doubt you have obferved in thefe accounts,that the conduct of the inagiftrates was condemned, andon the other hand, that the condu<5t of capt. Bufhel whocommanded the detatchment of foot then in town, wasjuftified : But by the following narrative, you will feethat the magiflrates did upon that occafion, all that couldhave been expeded from men in their circumftances; andthat on the other hand captain Bulhel, in deftroying fomany of the inhabitants, adted with the utmoft precipita¬tion.On the twenty third of June, when the malt tax, asregulated in the laff feflion of parliament, was to takeplace in Scotland, there appeared pretty early in theftreets and about the fkirts of the city where the maltbarns are fituated, a number of idle women and boys,whole defign was to hinder the excife officers to enter in¬to thefe barns : Tho’ Che magillrates caufed thefe idlepeople to be difperfed when and wherefoever they ap¬peared, yet the officers did not attempt to enter the barns,fearing that from thefc fmall beginnings upon fuch anoccafion as this of levying the malt tax, a more formi¬dable mob might grow up, againft which the magiftratesmight not be able to protedf them, befides they were e-very day in expedation that a party of the king’s forceswould be fent to Glafgow, to proted them in that ler-vice. On the day following being the 24th, the famefet of idle people appeared now and then in the ftreetsand corners of the city, but as foon as they appeared theywere difperfed by the tnagiftrates. About fix o clock at( 3 )night two companys of lord Ddorain’s regiment of foot,commanded by captain Bulhel, came to town : The ma-giitrates ordered the guard-houfe to be opened and fittedup for their reception; while this was a doing, the townfervants were all of a fudden attacked, and driven out ofthe guard by a mob, who locked up the doors, and car¬ried off the keys. The piovoft, who is the head magi-ftratc of the city, getting intelligence hereof, fent hisofficers to break open the doors, and a little after « as go¬ing in perfon to fee it done, but in his way was met byfome of the inhabitants, who told him that his officerswere beaten and bruifed by the mob, and driven awayfrom the guard; that it would be dangerous for him toventure his perfon among them; and that the foldiersbeing but few, and fatigued with a long march in verybad weather, it would be more commodious for them,and would more effeftually quiet the minds of the people,and fecure the peace of the town, to fend them into quar¬ters for that night, and to caufe the inhabitants to keepguard as ufual. The provoft acquainted the captainhereof, who appeared to be well fatisfied with it, becaufehis men were much fatigued, and as he faid, he expe&ednext day to be re-inforced with other two companies, andfo the provoft caufed the ordinary guard to he warned.This being over the provoft, and Mr. Campbell ofBlythfwood, the only other juftice of the peace then intown, the dean of guild, and other inhabitants of theplace, waited in the town-hcufe till near nine o’clock atnight, and there being no ap4 earance of any diforder,they went into a tavern, le.iving ou’ers with their officersto watch in the ftreets, and if any tumult appeared, toacquaint them thereof.After 10 o’clock at nignt, the provoft and company withhim received an account, that the mob had aflaulted thehoufe of Daniel Campbell of Shawfield, member of par¬liament for the city, which Hands in one of the extremi¬ties of the town. This account was exceedingly furpriz-ing to the provoft and all that were with him, becaufethey had not the leaft knowledge or apprehenfion of anyfuch defign: However they all immediately repaired toMr. Campbell’s honfe, where they foupi A more formi-A 2 dable( 4dable mob than heretofore had appeared in the Greets,confifting of a good number of ftyrdy young fellows arm¬ed with clubs and other weapons, having alfo large ham¬mers and other fuch tools proper for breaking up thedoors, and beating down the houfe, not one of themwere known to the provoft and his company; howeverthey dealt with them partly by intreaties, and partly bythreats to defift their enterprife ; After a long time fpentwith them, they at length prevailed upon them to retire,which they did accordingly; but as they were going off,they were met and turned back by a great many rioters,who were coming towards Mr, Campbell’s houfe uponthe fame defign; thefe infulted the provoll and the gen¬tlemen that were with him to the higheft degree, beatdown the town officers, and threatned to cut the provoftand his company in pieces; and becaufe they did not re¬tire at thefe threats, they went about to lay violent handsupon them, fo that at length they were obliged to fly fortheir lives, being in their flight purfued by a good num¬ber of the rioters, from whom they efcaped with greatdifficulty.The provoft, as 1 told you before, had caufed fome ofthe inhabitants be advertifed to mount guard as ufual,yet this unfortunate accident falling out before their or¬dinary time of mounting guard, which is between ten andeleven o’clock at night, diverted them from going to theguard that night, tho’ in reality they were twice warnedto it both before and after the foldiers came to the town:But fuppofing they had been upon guard they could havebpen of no ufe upon fuch an occafion as this, or againftfuch a formidable nyffi, becaufe they were but few innumber, and conftft of the poorer fort of people, whoare hired to that fervice by the other inhabitants; andthey are no other than fo many watch men whofe bufi*nefs is to alarm the inhabitants in cafe of fire, and to pre¬vent diforders by drunkards, thieves, and other fuchperfons in the night time.When it was near twelve o’clock at night, the provoftbeing then deliberating with the gentlemen that werewith him, about calling for the affiftance of the military,a ferjeant came to the provoft from capt, Bufhell, offer-, ing-ing him his affiftance, if there was any occafion For ifThe provoft faid, that he was moft willing to accept ofthe affiftance of the captain and his foldiers, but afkedthe ferjeant how he propofed to gather his foldiers toge¬ther? The ferjeant anfwered by beatingjthe drum. Theprovoft reply’d that by this the rioters who were nowmoft numerous and outragious, would be alarmed; thatthey would ailault the drums, beat down and difarm thefoldiers, one by one as they came feverally out of theirquarters, fo that they Ihould not be able to repair to anyplace of rendezvous; alfo the men being in bed, and therioters in full pofleffion of the houfe, going through eve¬ry corner of it with lighted candles, the mifchief wouldprobably be over before the foldiers could be gathered :To all this the ferjeant anfwered that things might fo fallout for that was the cafe, the men were all in bed.The rioters being thus abfolute matters of the houfe,fpared nothing but the walls, floors, and roof, whichthey could neither fo eafily, nor fo fuddenly pull down ;of the houlhold goods, fome part they deftroyed, andother part they carried off; yet a good part of the moftvaluable furniture was faved for Mr. Campbell’s ufe, be¬ing carried off by honeft people who went in tofave whatthey could.While all this was a doing, Mr. Campbell and his fa¬mily were at his country houfe of Woodhall, eight milesdittant from the town, he himfelf had gone thither onTuefday the aad of June, being the day before the malttax commenced, and next day he was followed by his la¬dy and children and fome fervants; fo that there wereonly a few fervants in the houfe when this riot happen¬ed. Whether Mr. Campbell removed himfelf and fa¬mily at that time, from an apprehenfion of this misfor¬tune, or not, 1 cannot tell, but it is certain that one JohnWoddrow, did inform Hedlor Thomfon, Mr. Campbell'sfervant, while Mr. Campbell was yet in town, that therewas a flying report that his matter’s houfe was to be pul¬led down; and Thomfon having acquainted his matterthereof, returned to Woddrow, telling him, that hismatter thanked him for his information. The forefaidJohn Woddrow declared this upon oath before his maief-A 3 ty’«!Itj’s advocate, when he made inquifnlon Into that matterat Glafgow, of which ! {hall hereafter acquaint you. 6newouiJ believe that Mr. Campbell’s removal proceededfrom this information, but it is very ftrange that he ne¬ver told the magiftrates hereof, who, if they had got time¬ly notice, could eafily have prevented the whole mif-chief: However, tho’ Mr. Campbell negle&ed to givethe forefaid information to the magiftrates, by whichhis hOufe might have been faved, yet it is not to be doubt¬ed that he took care of his cafti, bills, banknotes, jewels,and other fuch valuable things which could be removedwithout obfet vationNext day being Friday the 25th of June, the provoftfet tradefmen on work to fecure and (hut up the paffatresto Mr. Campbell’s houfe, which was done accordingly.Then about eleven o’clock he put the foldiers in poflcffionof the guard houfe; and for further fecurity of the peaceof the town, he ordered two hundred of the inhabitantsto aflemble at the town-houfe at three o’clock in the af¬ternoon, there to attend for receiving fuch orders asfhould be thought fit to be given them; but this was alfodiverted by the difmal tranfaftions that happened beforethe time of their meeting.Between two and three o’clock in the afternoon, theprovoft with a good many merchants and others beingthen walking before the town-houfe, there appeared amob, confifting for the moft part of women and boys,armed with clubs and fuch other weapons, who had beengathered together by an old woman beating a drum be¬fore them ; when they approached to the town-houfe theprovoft and thofe that were with him attacked them anddifarmed them, and with their own arms beat them off,and difperfed them; thefe gathering tbeinfelves togetherby lanes and back ways, appeared a little after before themain guard, and threw fome ftones at the foldiery, uponwhich captain Bufhell turned out his guard, caufed themform into a hollow iquare, by which they faced towardsthe four ftreets which center at the guard-houfe. Onewould believe from this difpofition made by the captain,that he was to be attacked on all fides by a formidable e-nemy; but from the declarations of about thirty or four¬ty( 7 )ty eye-witnefies, it appears that the enemy which he wasafraid of, was a mob confifting for the moft part of wo¬men and boys, that of thefe a great many were drawntogether outofcuriofity, when the foldiers formed them-felves into a fquare; that fuch of the mob as came thitherwith an evil defign, had no arms nor other weapons; norcould they do any mifchief to the foldiery but by throw¬ing of Pones; that they having thrown fome ftones at'the foldiers, the captain advanced towards a youngman who was doing no harm and beat him fo unmerci¬fully with his half pike that he brake it in pieces, uponwhich fome more ftones were thrown at them, but nodanger done, no foldier either wounded or bruifed: TheKing’s proclamation was not read, but the captain fworeby God, if they would not depart, he would fire uponthem: And becaufe his orders were not immediately o-beyed, he was as good as his word; while the foldierswere prefenting their firelocks, fome of the mob run a-way, yet he gave command to fire, and by this firft fire,two innocent perfons who were not concerned in the tu¬mult, but going about their lawful bufinefs, and wdioknew nothing either or his orders of his threatnings, werefhot dead in the ftreets. Some gentlemen who were di¬verting themfelves at bowls in the bowlling-green, hear¬ing this firft fire, came rufliing out into the Candleriggs ;though there was no mob in that ftreet, and no ftonesthrown from thence, yet the platoon that faced that wayfired upon them, and would have done execution, hadnot the gentlemen as foqn as the foldiers were prefentingtheir mufkets, covered themfelves under a houfe, yet bythis fire a poor man was wounded who was crofting theftreet about his lawful bufinefs. A poor blackfnaith withhis cloak about him pafling by the head of one of thefeftreets, neither doing nor fearing any harm, was fhotthro’ the head by one of thefe officers, with apiftol whichhe had concealed under his cloaths, and the fame officeradvancing forward from his platoon, either with the fameor another piftol, fhot another poor tradefman who waspaffing by without doing or defigning any harm. Tho’by thefe bloody and cruel executions the mob was all atonce difptrfed and the ftreets cleared, yet the foldiersA 4 con-< 8 )continued to fire, pointing their firelocks to the Tides ofthe ftreets, the entries of clofles, and to windows two orthree ftairs high: So that while the poor dying people,lay weltering in their blood upon the ftreets, it was dan¬gerous for any perfon to draw near to give them any af-fiftance. One woman was ftiot upon a ftair; anotherbeneath a ftair; and a third, being a young gentlewo¬man, was Ihot looking throw a window into the ftreetstwo ftairs high.While this bloody tragedy was adirg at the guard, theprovoft with a good number of the inhabitants was atthe town houfe, from whence he difpatched a gentlemanto captain Bulhell, to expoftulate with him how he cameto fire without givin ghim advice thereof before hand, asbe promifed in the forenoon when he was pm in pofleffionof the guard; the captain’s anfwer to the gentleman was, Ithat he could not ftand to be knocked down with his men:The gentleman replyed, that if he had given previousnotice to the provoft, he would have difperfed the incon-iiderable mob that alfaulted him, without fliedding onedrop of their blood. During this conference the firingceafed, upon wnich feme people appearing from thehoufis and clofles into which they had retired, the gen¬tleman taking captain B.i(hell’s cane out of his hand, runtowards them and chafed them away : And returning tothe captain, obferved to him what an cal'y matter it wasto have prevented aM this bloodflied, and intreated himto give over firing, till he returned to h*m from the pro¬voft. When the gentleman came to the provoft, hefound him befet by a more formidable mob than was atthe guard, who being exafperated at the murder of fo ma¬ny of their fellow citizens, threarned revenge upon thefoldiers, and deftru&ion to the provoft and his companyif theyoppofed them; and foithwith running up ftairs tothe town houfe magazine, broke up the doors, carriedout the arms and rung the fire bell to alarm the wholecity. The provoft fearing that the foldiers would be cutin pieces, dii'patched the fame gentleman to the captainto acquaint him of all this, and to tell him it was his opi¬nion, that the propereft way to fave hinifeif and his tol-diers, was to retire out of the city. The captain retiredaccord -V 9accordingly, and all the time of their retreat, though nomob followed them, feme ot the foldiers faced about andfired upon people that were only looking after them, andnot ofFtring them any violence. When they came to theWed-port, through which they were to march out ofthe town, one of the foldiers etpying a fhee maker Hand¬ing at the head of a ftreer, aimed at him and ihot himdead, though there was no tumult there, and this poorman having been at another end of the town knew no¬thing of w’bat had paffed at the guard. There were inall nine perfons killed and feventeen wounded.This account of the forefaid bloody a&ion, I have ex¬tracted from the decorations of near forty perfons whowere eyi-witrefTes of the faffs, and whofe declarationsart in wri iog hereof in my hand. And now S;r, I fub-mit to your judgment, whether captain Bufhell’s conductin this matter be jufbfiable or not, or if he has not beenguilty of the molt unaccountable rafhnefs. After thefoldiers retired, they marched to Dumbarton, which isdiftant ten long miles from this place, but by the waythey took, is fourteen miles; which abftraffing from theforefaid declarations, is of itfelf a fubftantial evidence ofthat part of the forefaid narrative, that the foldiers re¬ceived no mifehief by theftones that were thrown at them.About an hour after they marched fromGlafgow, theywere followed by a good number of people, who aftertheir departure, were provoked to fee fo many of theirfellow-citizens deflroyed ; of thefe very few were in arms,and of fuch as were armed, few had fire arms, and as Iam informed fuch fire arms as they had were unfit forfei vice. They did not overtake them, but only cameup with two ftragglers, who through bodily indifpofid-on, under which they had laboured for fome days before,were not able to keep up with the reft in their haftymarch ; to thefe they offered not the lead violence, onlybrought them prifoners to the town. Upon their firftenterance, one of them by the afilftance of fome of theinhabitants, made his efcape, the other was affaulted andbeaten by the friends of the dead and wounded perfons,but at length was refeued by other of the inhabitants andfut unto lafe cuftody, and a furgeon was appointed toattendattend him* and In a few days after he was perfectlycured of his wounds, and got money to carry him toEdinburgh.As foon as the news of this matter reached Edinburgh,a moft fcandalous account thereof was publifhed in theCaledonian Mercury, of the 29th of Jane, refle&ing onthe magiftrates of Glafgow, and containing profs infinu-ations of their being acceffary to all thefe diforders. It•was faid, “ That capt. Bufhell, as foon as the mob be-“ gan to aflemble, at Mr. Campbell’s houfe, fent to the“ magiftratesfororderstodifptrfe them, buttheyanfwer-“ ed, that they did not think it convenient to makeufe of“ his afliftance.” From what I have laid you will fee,that the mob began to afl'emble at ten o’clock at night,and the forefaid meffage from capt. Bufhell, did not cometo the provoft till near twelve, when the mob was moftnumerous and outragious, and when it would have beenthe greateft imprudence to beat up the foldiers out oftheir quarters. It is alfo faid in the forefaid news paper,“ That capt. Bufhell when infulted by the mob, at the“ guard, caufed a conftable read the proclamation, the“ magiftrates it feems not thinking it fafe to countenanceu him.” Whereas in truth there was no conftable there,no proclamation read, and the magiftrates would havewillingly, without any apprehenfion of danger, counte¬nanced capt. Bufhell, and fuppreffed the mob, but thecaptain did not ad vertife them of it, but of his own accordfired upon the mob, and killed fundry of them upon thefpot. Its further faid, “ That capt. Bufhell fired at firftblunt fhot, hoping thereby to affright the mob.” 1Whereas by the firft fire two perfons were killed. Its al¬fo infinuated in the forefaid news papers, “ That when“ the magiftrates advifed the captain to retire with the“ detatchment out of town, there was no neceffity for“ it;” and yet if they had not retired, it is highly pro¬bable they would have been a!ll cut in pieces. It is like-wife faid, “ That on Saturday the mob continued ring-“ ing of fire bells, See. and pulling down the roof and•• floors of Shawfield’s houfe;” this is alfo falfe, for therewere no fire bells rung after Friday, when captain Bu¬fhell committed the above mentioned flaughter: Neitherwere1 - •     —;—\ 11 )were the roof nor floors of Mr. Campbell’s houfe pulleddown, but remain unto this day The next harangueis, “ That two of the foldierswho were fo bruifed with“ ftones, that they were not able to keep up with the“ party, fell into the hands of the mob, who ufed them“ very barbaroufly; one efcaped into a houfe, but the“ other is fo bruifed with ftones that his life is defpaired“ of;” all this is abfolutely falfe as appears by the fore¬going account. That two of the mob went to Dumbar¬ton, and threatned the inhabitants if they received cap- *tain Bufhell and his foldiers, is what I know nothing a-bout. And laftly, if the mob threatned to aflaflinate Mr.Campbell at his country houfe, yet it is certain they ne¬ver went thither.It is faid, that the magiftrates of Edinburgh were thepublifhers of this account, and particularly that they cal¬led upon Mr James M'Euen to print it; that becaufe ofthe many reflexions upon the magiftrates of Glafgowtherein contained, he refufed to doit: That thereuponthey called for one Rolland, publilher of the CaledonianMercury, whe at their defire publiftied it in the faid newspaper. When the roagiftrates of Glafgow had notice ofit, they wrote a ftiort account of the forefaid diforders,and fent it to Mr. M'Euen to be inferted in his Courant,but he was forbid by the magiftrates of Edinburgh to doit on pain of imprifonment, and after the fame was pri¬vately printed, they under the fame penalty difchargedthe Edinburgh hawkers to call it about in the ftreets.Sir, I leave it to you to judge if the publiftiing fuch afcandalous libel, in which his majefty’s bell fubjeXs werereprefented as rioters and rebels, were not a real dif-fer-I vice done to his majefty; and if the reftraining the liber- .ty of the prefs, by which they were hin iered to juftifythemfelvcs from thefe vile imputations which had beencaft upon them, was not opprrilion in a high degree.1 cannot acquaint you what accounts of this matterwere fent to their excellencies, the lords juftices of GreatBritain, but it would appear by the confequences, thatthe city of Glafgow had been reprefented to their lord-fhips as in a ftate of rebellion; for by their excellenciesorders, general Wade did on the 9th of July laft marchtowardsftowards the faid city a confiderable body ofliis majefty’sforces, confifttng of my lord Delorain’s regiment of foot,fix troops of the Royal Scots dragoons, as many of theearl of Stair’s dragoons, and one of the independent com¬panies of Highlanders, under the command of Sir Dun¬can Campbell of Lochnei, with a Train of Artillery, am¬munition, &c. and wnen the general approached the ci¬ty, he made a halt with his forces, and fent a letter tothe magiftrates, fignifying, “ That he was by their ex-“ ceflencies,' ordered to march a body of his majefty’s“ forces into the city of Glafgow, in order to lupportthe civil power in retloring the peace and quiet of the“ city ; and being informed that feveral ol the inhabi-“ tarns had armed themlelves, and kept a guard in the“ town, he required the magiftrates to difarm them, and“ fecure their arms in fome fafe magazine.” But thegeneral was foon fatisfied that this was calumny and mif-reprefentation, for as the magiHrates had acquainted himin their anfwer to his letter, the city was in perfeft peace,and he marched his troops and train into it without theleaft didurbance, and that night they were all lodgedwithin the city.Mr. Duncan Forbes his majefty’s advocate attendedthe general in this expedition; his bufinefs was to makeaftridt inquiry into the diforders that had happened, andto difcover the autbors thereof. On Saturday being thetoth of July, a great many perfons of the heft charadlerin town, were examined before him, and they all teftifiedthe truth of what I have above mentioned, in relation tothe provoft’s condudf. On Monday early in the morning,a great many poor people were taken out of their beds,and committed prifoners to the guard, on fulpicton thatthey had been concerned in the late riots; but upon ex¬amination the greater part was difmiff;d, the reft beingabout twenty in number were remanded to priton. Thatday the two companies of capt. Bufhell which retired toDumbarton, returned to Glafgow. The advocate con¬tinued his incjuiiition theTuefday, Wednefday and Thurf-day following, all perfons that were fummoned compear¬ed, and were examined upon oath, but it could not bedifcovered that any perfon of note or charadter in theplace{ 13 }place was in the lead concerned in the late riot*. On Thurfday af¬ternoon the magiftrates with the Jean of guild and deacon conveener i-were called upon by the advocate, and fttndry interrogatories pro-pofed to them, which they anfwered. I cannot acquaint you whatdifcoveries did arife from thefe anfwers, becaufe tho’ they were wrotedown, yet the advocate has always excufed himfelf from giving acopy thereol when k was demanded of him by the magiflrates.I am now com* to the ftrange and furprizing tranfaftions whichhappened on Friday the 16th of July. On that day about noon capt,Bufhell’s detachment of foot was drawn up at the mercat crofs nearto the tolbooth; the captain himfelf brought thither from the guardhoufe in his own hands a bundle of ropes, which he carried into theforefaid prifon, and there bound the prifoners, which as I have a-bove mentioned were fufpefted to have been concerned in the fore¬faid riots After this they were brought down from the prifon intheir manacles, and delivered to the cuftody of the faid captain andhis detachment, to be by them carried prifoners to Edinburgh.While this was a doing Charles Miller provoft, John Stirling, JamesJohnfon, and James Mitchell, bailies, John Stark dean of guild,John Armour deacon conveener, are all apprehended by a confta-ble, and incarcerated in the tolbooth of Glaigovv, by Cxfeveral war¬rants iffited by his majefly’s advocate. The news of this flyingthrough the city, brought together to the mercat crofs a vaft con¬course of people, who were all exceedingly furpriztd at theft (trangeoperations. I am very far from believing or imagining, that mylord advocate intended any evil by thefe proceedings; but I am furethey had a natural tendency to create new diforders in the place: butGod be thanked no fuch things happened; the multitude at the de¬fire of the wifer fort of the inhabitants difperfed all at once, and. re¬turned to iheir habitations.The tenor of the warrant for committing the magiftrates wasmuch the fame; and the form of the warrant is fuch.Ey the Right Hon. Duncan Forbes his Majefty’s Advocate, andone of the Juftices of the 1'eacs for the Shire of Lanerk.“ WHERE AS it appears Ly the examination of divevs witnef-.fes upon oath taken before me. That the magiltrates of Glafgow,and particularly Charles Miller the preftnt provoft, has by his con-duff as a magiftrate, favoured and encouraged the mobs, tumults,and riotous a(lemblies which happened at Glafgow upon the 14th,and ajth of June hft, whereby the houfe of Darnel Campbell ofShawfield was entirely pillaged, and in a great meafure deftroyed;and whereby two companies of his majefty’s forces lying in Glaf¬gow, were violently aflaultcd and invaded, compelled to retire outof the town, and purflied by an armed force, who made twoof theirnumber prifoners, and maltreated them barbaroufly when they werefo prifoners in the ftreets of Glafgow. And whereas by th* late ex¬amination, it alfo appears, that the faid provoft Miller is guilty ofdivers other afls of partiality and male adroiniftration in his office,with refpeft to the difeharge of his duty towards the affors in thefaid riots and tumults: Thefe ate therefore requiring you to feizcthei\r(•1 T 4 )the body of the faid Charles Miller, and to commit him prifbner tothe tolbooth of Glafgow, there to be detained in cuftodv, until hefhall be from thence delivered over to a lufllcient guard of his majef-ty’s forces, to be appointed by the general, in order to his beingtranfported fafe to the tolbooth of Edinburgh, there to abide histrial, Andthe magiftrates and keepers of the tolbooth of Edinburghare hereby required to receive the body of the fin'd Charles Milier.when he fhall be delivered to them as above, and to detain him infure cufiody within their tolbooth, until he (hall be from thence li¬berated by due order of law. Given at Glafgow the »<5th July 1715years. Sic 1'ubfcribitur, Dun. Forbes.”“ To the conftables of the (hire of Lanerk, or any of them.To the keepers of the tolbooth of Glafgow, and to the magiftratesand keepers of the tolbooth of Edinburgh.’’The authority from whence thefe variants proceeded, occafion-ed great (peculations among the gentlemen of the law. The Lotdsof judiciary who are fupreme judges in criminals within Scotland,when this affair came before them, gave it as their opinion, that(nice the union his majefty's advocate had no power of commitment.It would feem that the advocate himfelf was al(b of this opinion be-caufe he adds in the warrant as another fource of his authority,“ That he is one of the juftices of the peace in the Ihire of Lanerk.”but then it is much doubted if it is in the povyer of any one jufticeof peace to commit the whole magiferates of a place, and efpeciallythe provofc of the city of Glafgow, who befides being bis majefty’slieutenant there, is a juftice of peace in fpecial for the city, andtherefore within that juiifdiiTtion not fubjeff to the authority of anyother juftice within the county. But further, it is hard to be under-ftood, how a juftice of peace in the county of Lanerk, could by laworder any perfon whatfoever to be committed to the cuftody of theking's forces, to be by them carried out of the county of Lanerk,thro’ the counties of Dumbarton, Stirling, Linlithgow, and untothe cor’Uy of Edinburgh, there to be imprifoned. But theft thingsI leave^o the confideration of lawyers, and proceed to coniider thecrimes cxpfefled in the warrants, as the caufe of their commitment.It is laid, “ That by their conduit they favoured and eucourag-« ed the mobs, &c. whereby Mr. Campbell’s houfe was riffled, and“ whereby two companies of the king’s forces were aflaultcd, com-“ pelled to retire out of town, purfued and two of them taken andr‘ beaten in the ftreets, and were alfo guilty of divers other aits of“ partiality and male adminiftration in the difeharge of their office,“ with refpeft to the laid rioters.” How this charge is to be main¬tained againft thefe gentlemen is more than I can tell, I have heardit faid that the provoft was much to be blamed becaufe he did notput the foldiers in pofleffion of the guard upon their firit arrival;tecaufe for that night the guard was not kept by the inhabitants orsny other, the like whereof had never happened fince the revolution ;and becaufe he did not call for the affiftance of the foldiers; andwhen captain Bulhell offered it he retufed it. But all this is abun¬dantly defended by the foregoing narrative. And tho’ we Ihouldgrant that he might have done better, yet it would be the greateft( IS )hardfhip in the world to charge a gentleman as being acceflbry to acrime, when it is plain he intended to hinder the commiflion of it,an^l purfued his intentions by fuch methods as feeiped at that timemolt proper to him and to all that were about him. It is a difficulttalk to manage in the midft of great and fudden confuiions, but itis exceedingly eafy to reflefl upon a man’s management after it is o-ver. It has been alfo laid that John Stirling and James Johnfonwere at the time of this riot abfcnt from the place, very true, but didthey forefee that this riot was to come to pafs, and to encourage itwent out of the way? by no means; for Mr. Stirling was at Edin¬burgh two or three weeks before it happened, and was obliged to bethere upon private affairs, and particularly attending a law fuitwhich was not determined till the very day before the Hot happen¬ed, and on that very day was fettling and nnilhing allmatters in re-fpeed to the faid law fuit before he left Edinburgh. Mr. Johnfonwas at the lair or public mercar of Perth, to which place he hadgone from Glafgow fotne days before, and he being a dealer in li¬nen doth which is fold in great quantities in that mercat, he has nott>een known for thirty years paft to be once abfent from that fair.Mr. Mitchell who is the youngeft magiftrate in the city, was in hisown houfe at the time; when the news of the not was brought tohim, not knowing of the provoft’s being there, he was afraid to ven¬ture himfelt into the tumult, and tho’ otherwife abundantly capablefor his office as a magillrate, yet he is very unfit for adventures ofthat kind; it is true he being trades bailie, might be fuppoftd tohave more than ordinary influence upon the rioters; but it is truealfo that among thefe rioters there was not one tradefman of cha-rafter, or who was either burgefs or freeman in the city, and its pro¬bable that moft of them were flrangers from the country. It ishard to imagine in what manner the charge is to be maintained a-gainft John Stark dean of guild ; this gentleman though he is not amagi (Irate or the city, yet as he had done all that day, fo all thatnight he afted in concert with the provofr, and did all that was inhis power for iupprefling the tumult; and nothing feems to bechargeable upon him, but that he had not power enough to fupprefait. As for John Armour deacon ccmveentr, he was in his houfethat night, but knew nothing of the riot till next morning; andthis was no extraoidinary thing, for that affjir having been tranf-afted in a corner of the town, and late*at night, there were manyhundreds of families in the place, efpecially fuch as lived in backlanes as this gentleman did, who undeallood nothing of the mattertill next morning. In the lad place perhaps it will be charged up¬on all of them, that after the tumults were over they did not takeUp the rioters; but the anfwer is plain, few or none of tjiefe rioterswere known to them; and if it had been otherwife, yet confideringthe ferment that was in town occafioned by the Ihedding of fo muchinnocent blood, it was too hard a talk for them to undertake; andhis majefty's advocate was not inlenfible of this, fpr when he cameupon that errand, he was guarded by a confiderable body of hismajefty’s forces. But to return to the thread of the flory.On Saturday the 17th of July, the forefaid gentlemen werebrought out of the tolbooth of Claigow, and under a guard of theRoyal( 16 )Royal Scots Dragoons, were condufted prifoners to Falkirk, wherethey refted next day, being Surday On Monday about noon cap¬tain Bufhell arrived at iidinburgh with his prifoaerr, who were com¬mitted to the caftle without any warrant; but to fupply that defeft,the warrant was fent to the commander of ihnt garrifon after theircommitment. About five o’clock in the afternoon the foreiaid gen¬tlemen were brought to the town, they were met by another partyof the Royal Scots Dragoons, fome of Stair’s Dragoons and twocompanies of Highlanders, and by all thefe they were conduced ingreat triumph thro’ the ftreets to the toibooth of Edinburgh. Theyweie met at fbme diftance from the town by feveral gentleman fromEdinburgh, and fourty or fifty of their own merchants, who camefrom Glafgow to accompany them into the city of Edinburgh, uponthis extraordinary occafion.Next day, being thi aoth of July, application was made forthem to the Lords of Judiciary, that they might he liberated uponbail; this had been offered to the advocate ay Glafgow when theywere committed to the prifon there, "but he refufed it, faying thatthe crime was not bailable, yet the Lords of Judiciary did unani-moufly give fentence to the contrary, and bail being given, theywere by their lordlhips orders fet at liberty about fix o’clock thatnight.On Wednefday the aid, two of.the magiftrates left Edinburgh,apd arrived at Glafgow that evening; they were met at five or fixmiles didance from the town by fome hundreds of the inhabitantson horfeback, who couduaed them into the city, where they werereceived with ringing of bells, and other dcmonllrations of joy.I am, S I RjYours, &c.Glasgow, Sep. id. 1715.THE END.

John did speer.S\vs Thrummy, Sure ye needna care,9I’ll gae and try to get some mair.Sae down the stair again he goes.To get o’ drink, anither dose.Being positive to hae some mair:But still he faund the Ghaistwas there.Mow cm> a butt behind the door :Says he, Ye didna ill before.Dear brother Thrummy, sae I’ll tryYou once again, because I’m dry.He fills his jug straight out below,An’ up the stair again does go,John marveil’d sair, but didnaspeerAgain where he did get the beer,Tor it was st*onger than the first,Sae'they baith drank till like to burst.Syne did compose themselves to rest.To sleep a while they thought it best.An hour in bed they hadna been,And scarcely weel had closed their een.Whan just into the neighbouring cham’er,They heard a dreadful din and clamour,Beneath the- bed-claes John did cowr.But Thrummy jumped upon the floor.Him by the sark-tail John did baud.Lie still, quoth he, fat, are you mad ?Thrummy then gaed a hasty jump.And took John in the ribs a thump,Till on the bed be tumbled down,In little better than a swoon,While Thrummy, fast as he could rin,Set off to see fat made the din.The chamber seem’d to him as light,10As gif the sun was shining bright jThe Gfcaist was stanan at the door.In the same dress he had afore jAnd o'er anent it, at the wa‘,Were ither apparitions twa.Thrummy beheld them for a wee,But deil a word as yet spoke he jThe spirits seem'd to kick a ba‘.The Ghaist against the ither twa :While close they drave baith back & fore,Atween toe chimla and the door.He stops a while, and sees the play,Syne, rinning up, he this did say :Ane for ane may weel compare,^But twa for ane is rather sair jThe play's nae equal, say I vow,Hear brother Thrummy, Til help you,Then wi‘ his feet he kick'd the ba‘,Gard it play stot against the wa‘:Quick then, as lightning frae the sky.The Spectres, with a horrid cry,Ai vanish'd in a clap o' thun'er.While Thrummy at the same did won'er,The room was quiet now and dark,And Thrummy stirping in his sark ;Glauming the gate back to his bed,He thinks ae hears a person tread,yin' ere he gat without the door,The Ghaist again stood him before,And in his face did staring stand,Wi' a big caudle in its hand,114* f vQuoth Thrummy, Friend, I want to kiqowWhat brings you frae the shades below ?I, in my Maker's name, commandYou tell your story just aff hand ?Fat wad ye hae ?—I'll do my bestFor you, to let you be at rest,Then says the Ghaist, ‘ Tis thirty yearsSince I've been doom'd to wander here :In all that time there has been noneBehav'd sae bold as ye have done:Sae, if you'll do a job for me,Disturbance sgriair I'll never gie.Say on your tale, quoth Thrummy, I,To do you justice, sure will try,Then mark me wee!, the Ghaist reply'd,And you shall soon be satisfy‘d :Frae this aback near forty years,I of this place was overseer,When this Laird's father had the land,A1 thing was then at ray command,Wi' power to do as I thought fit.In iiUi cause I chief did sit: NThe Laird paid great respect to me,But I an ill return did gie :The Title-deeds of his estateOut of the same I did him cheat.And staw them frae where they did iie jSome days before the Laird did die.His son, at that timej was fn France,And sae I thought I'd hae a chance,Gif he should never come again.That the Bstate would be my ain.12But scarcely three bare weeks v^ere past.When ueath did come and grip me fast,Sae, sudden that I had nae pow’rThe charter back for to restore.Soon after that hame came the heir.And syne got up the reefu* rair,What sorrow was come o’ the Rights ?They sought them several days an’ nights,But never yet hae they been seen,Js I aneath a meikle stane,Did hide them, i’ this cham’er wa',Well sewed up in a leather ba*;But I was ne’er allowed to rest,Until that l the satre contest;But this to do 1 hadna power,Frae yon time to this verra hour,That I've reveal'd a’ to you ;And now I'll tell you what to do.Till uae iangsyne nae mony kent,That this same Laird the Rights did want;But now they ha’e him at the law,An’ the neist owk the Laird maun shaw.Afore the Court, the Rights o’s land,This puts him to an unco stand :For if he disna shaw them lucre,O’ a’ his lands he’ll be stript bare :Nae hopes has he to save’s estate.This make'him sowr and unco blate ;fie canna think whar’s Rights may be.And ne’er expects them mair to see.But now’, my fViend, mark what I teN,And ye’ll get something to yoursel* j13Tak out the stane there iu the wa\And there you’ll get the leather ba\*Tis just the same that you did see,Whan you said that you wad help me.The rights are sew’d up in its heart;But see ye didna wi’ them part,Until the Laird shall pay you downJust fifty guineas and a crown,Whilk at my death was due to me.This for thy trouble, I’ll give thee ;And I'll disturb this house nae mair,’Cause I’ll be free fiom all my care.This Thrummy promised to do.And syne the Ghaist bid him adieu.And vanished with a pleasant sound,Down thro’ the laft, and thro’ the ground.Thrummy gade back syne till bis bed.And cowardly John was verra glad.That he his neiber saw once mair.For of bis life he did despair.Wowman, quoth John, wharhae„you been,Come tell me a’ fat ye hae seen,Na, bide, says Thrummy, till day-light.And syne I’ll tell you hale and right.Sae baith lay still and took a nap,Until the ninth hoar it did chap;'Thrummy sine raise, put on his claes.And to the cbam’er quick be gaes.Taks oat the stane into the vva’,And soon he found the leather ba’ ;Took out the tights, replaced the stane.Ere John did ken whar he had been J14Then baith came stapping down the stair,The morning now was calm and fair.Weel, says the Laird, my trusty ffien’,Hae ye ought in your cham‘er seen ?Quoth Thrum my, Sir, I naething sawThat did me ony ill ava.Weel, quo’ the Laird, ye now may gang,Ye ken the day’s nae very lang :In the mean time its calm and clear.Ye loose your time in biding here.Quoth Thrummy, Sir, mind what I tell,l‘ve mair right here than you yoursel*:Sae till I like I here shall bide,The Laird at this began to chide : 'Says he, my Friend, ye‘re turning rude.Quoth Thrummy I'll my claim make goodFor here I, just before you a‘,The Rights o‘ this estate can sh^w,And that is mair than you can do."What! quo* the Laird, can that be true !‘Tis true, quoth Thrummy, look and see,D*ye think that I would tell a lie.The parchment from his pouch then drewAnd down upon the table threw,The Laird ut this up to him ran,And cry*d where did you get them man.Syne Thrummy tauFd him all the tale,As I*ve tauld you, baith clear and hale.The Laird at this was fidgir; fain.That he had gat his rights again jAnd fifty guineas down did tell,Besides a present frae hitnsel*.15Thrummy him thank'd, an* syns his gowdIntil a muckls purse he stowed,An* cram'd it in his oxter-pouch,^nd syne sought out his aiken crutch :Said, fare-ye-weel, I maun awa,An* see gin I get through the snaw.Weel, fare-ye-weei, replied the Laird ;How comes it ye ha‘na shared,Or gi‘en your mei‘bour o* the money ?Na, by my saul, I, Sir, quo* Thrummy,When I the siller, Sir, did win.To had done thi^ wad been a sin.yifore that I the Ghaist had laid,The nesty beast had the bed.And sae my tale I here do end,1 hope no one it will offend ;My muse will na* assist me langer,The dorty jade sometimes, does anger.I thought her ance a gay smart lass.But now she‘s come to such a pass.That a* my cudgelling and wheepiug,Will hardly Avake her out o* sleeping,To plague her mair I winna try,But dight my pen and lay it by.Young Whip-Stitch,A LONDON TAILORS SON.A London Taiior, as ‘tis said.By buckram, canvas, tape, an* thread,16Sleeve linings, pockets, silk and twist,_4nd all the long expensive list,With which their uncouth bills abound,Though rarely in their garments found jBy these and other arts in tradeHad soon a pretty fortune made,And did what few have ever done.Left thirty thousand to his son.The son, a gay young swaggering blade,ytfbhor’d the very name of trade ;^n’ lest reflection should be thrown, -3On him, resolved to leave the town.And travel where he was not known.In gilded coach and liveries gay.To Oxford first he took his way ;There beaux and belies his taste admire.His equippage and rich attire.As his fine silver billed sword,Tho’ short and small, ’twas vastly neat,The sight was deem’d a perfect treat;Beau Banter begg’d to have a look.But when the sword in hand he took.He swore by Gad ’twas an odd thingfAnd look’d much like a Tailor’s bodkin.His pride was hurt by this expressionThinking they knew his sire’s profession ;Sheathing his sword he sneak'd away,And drove for Gio'ster that same day.There soon he found new cause for grief,Fcr dining on some fine roast beef,One asked him which he did prefer,Some cabbage or a Cucumber.17| The purse-proud coxcomb took the hint,Thought it severe reflection meant;His stomach turned, he could not eat,So made an ungenteel retreat:Next day left Glo’ster in great wrath,And bid his coachman drive to Bath,There he suspected fresh abuse.Because the dinner was roast goose :And that he might no more be jeer'd,1 Next day to Exeter he steered,1 There with some bucks he drank about.Until he feared they'd found him ©ut,t His glass not filled, as was the rule,! They said, ‘Twas not a thimble full:The name of thimble was enough,He then to Plymouth took a trip,And put up at the Royal Ship,Which then was kept by Calib Snip.The host by name was often called,At which his guest was so much galled.That soon to Cambridge he removed :There too he unsuccessful proved :For though he fill'd his glass or cup,He did not always drink it up,The scholars marked how he behaved,And said a remnant should be saved.The name of remnant galled him so,That he resolved to York to go :There fill'd his bumper to the top,And always fairly drank it. up,Weil done , says Jack, a buck of York,Yougothrough stitch, Sir, withyour work.13The name of stitch was such reproach,He rung the bell, and ca!l‘d his coach,But e‘er he went, inquiries made,By what means they found out his tradeYou put the cap on, and it fits,Reply'd one of the Yorkshire wits,Our words in common acceptation,Could not find out your occupation,‘Twas you yourself gave us the cue,To find out both yourself and you.Vain coxcombs and fantastic beaux,la every place themselves expose :They travel far at vast expense,To shew their wealth and want of senseBut take this as a standing rule,“ There‘s no disguise can screen a foo!.“THE GIG DEMOLISHED.A POEM.by Mrs, barbauld.Ye heroes of the upper forns,who long for whip and reins,Come listen to a dismal tale,set forth in dismal strains.Young Jehu was a lad of fame,as all the school could tell,./It cricket, taw, and prison bars,he bore away the bell.39 •Now welcome Whitsundie was come,and boys with merry hearts,Were gone to visit their mamma,and eat their pies and tarts.As soon as John saw his sire,a boon, a boon, he cried,O if I am your darling boy,let me not be denied.My darling boy indeed thou art,the father wise replied,So name the boon ; 1 promise thee,it shall not be denied.Then give me Sir, your long lashed whipand give your gig and pair,To drive alone to yonder town,and flourish through the fair.The Father shook his head, My sonyou know not what you ask ;To drive a gig in crowded streets,is no such easy task.The horses full of rest and corn,: scarce I myself can guide,And much I fear if you attempt,some mischief will betide,Then think, dear boy, of something elsethat’s better worth your wishing,A bow and quiver, bats and balls,a rod and lines for fishing.2©But nothing could young Jehu please,except a touch at driving :*Twas. all in vain, his father found,to spend his breath in striving.At least attend, rash boy, he cried,and follow good advice,Or in a ditch both gig and you,will tumble in a trice.Spare, spare the whip,hold hard the reias,the steeds go fast enough ;Keep in the middle beaten tract,nor cross the ruts so rough :And when within the town you come,be sure, with special care,Drive clear of sign posts, booths and stalls,and monsters of the fair.The youth scarce heard his father out,but roard, Bring out the whisky !With joy he view'd the rolling wheels,ana prancing ponies frisky.He seized the reins, and up he sprung,and waved the whistling lash,Take care, take care, his father cried:but off he went slab dash.Who's this light spark, the horses thought,we‘il try your strength young master,So o'er the rugged turnpike road,still faster ran, an^ faster.21Young Jehu, tottering in his seat,now wished to pull him in,But pulling from so young a handthey valued not a pin.A drove of grunting bigs beforefill’d up the narrow way,Dash’d thro’ the midst the horses drove/and made a rueful day jFor some were trampled under foot,|some crush’d beneath the wheel;Loud, loud the drivers curst and sworeand loud the pigs did squeal!A farmer’s wife, and old blind Ball,went slowly on the roadWith butter, eggs, and cheese and cream,in two large paniers stow’d.E're Ball could stride the rut amain,the gig came thundering on—Crash went the paniers and the dameand Ball lay overthrown!Now throguh the town the mettled pairran rattling o’er the stones,They drove the crowd from side to side,and shook poor Jehu’s bones.When, lo! directly in the coursea monstrous form appear'd!A shaggy bear that stalk'd and roarsd,on hinder legs uprear'd.22Sideways they started at the sight,and whisk‘dithe gig half round ;Then ’cross the crowded market placethey flew with furious bound.First o’er a heap of crockry ware,the rapid car they whirl’d jAnd jugs and mugs, and pots and pansin iragments wide were hurl’d.A booth stood near with tempting cakes,and grocery richly fraught jAll Birmingham on t’other sidethe dazzel’d optics caught.With active wing the nimble steedsrush’d through the pass between,And scarcely touch’d ; the car behind' got through not quite so clean:For while one wheel one stall engag’d,its fellow took the other—JUire was the clash, down fell the booths,and made a dreadful pother.isluts, oranges, and gingerbread,and figs here roll'd around jAnd scissars, knives, and thimbles there,bestrewed the glittering ground.The fall of boards, the shouts and cries,urged on the horses faster;And as they flew at every stepthey caused some new disaster-23Here lay o'erturn'ctan woeful plighta pedlar and his pack.There in a shoeman‘s broken box,all London went to wrack.4-But now the fates decreed to stopthe ruin of the day,And make the gig and driver tooa heavy reckoning pay.A ditch there lay both btoad and deep,where streams as black as flux,From every quarter of the town,their muddv currents mix.•rDown lo its brink in heedless haste,the frantic horses flew.And in the midst with sudden jerk,their burden overthrew.| The prostrate gig with des‘prate force,they soon pull‘d out again.And at their heels in ruin dire,dragg‘d lumb‘ring o'er the plain.Here lay a wheel, the axle there,the body there remain'd,Till sever'd limb from limb the car,nor name nor shape remain'd.But Jehu must not be forgot,left floundering in the flood,"With clothesfall drenched, and mouthand eyes,beplastered o'er with mud.-24In piteous case he waded through.and gained the slippery side,Where grinning crowds were gatheredroundTo mock his fallen pride.They led him to a neighbouring pump,to clean his dismal face.Whence cold & heartless home he slunk,inveihd in sore disgrace.And many a bill for damage done,his father, had to pay :Take warning youthful drivers at),from Jehu's first essay.FUris.

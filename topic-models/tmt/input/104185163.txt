ALI BABAOB THEAN INTERESTING TALE.' OF SCOTLANDGLASGOW:PRINTED FOR THE BOOKSELLERS3.ALI BABA:ORioTHE FORTY THIEVES.ii .aavaiHT YTaoa i|In the country of Persia, there lived twoorothers, the sons of a poor man ; the onewas named Cassim, and the other Ali Baha ;Cassim, the elder, married a wife with aconsiderable fortune, and lived at his ease,in a handsome house, with plenty of ser¬vants ; but the wife of Ali Baba was aspoor as himself, they dwelt in a mean cot¬tage in the suburbs of the city, and hemaintained his family by cutting wood in aneighbouring forest.One day when Ali Baba was in the forestand prepared to load his asses with thewood he had cut, he saw a troop of horse-njen approaching towards him. He hadoften heard of robbers who infested thatforest, and in great fright, he hastily climbeda. large tree, which stood near the foot of arock, and hid himself among the branches.The horsemen soon galloped up to theroek, where they all dismounted. Ali Babacounted forty of them, and he could not- '  --"A -8doubt, but they were thieves, by their ill-looking countenances. They each took aloaded portmanteau from his horse, and hewho seemed to be their captain, turning tothe rock, said open sesame, and immediate¬ly a door opened in the rock, and all therobbers passed in, when the door shut of it-fi self. In a short time the door openedI again, and' the forty robbers came out, fol¬lowed by their captain, who said, shutsesame. The door instantly closed, and thetroop mounting their horses, were presentlyout of sight. j j . , . .Ali Baba remained in the tree a longtime, and seeing that the robbers did notreturn, he ventured down, and approach¬ing close to the rock, said, Open Sesame,immediately the door flew open, and Alii Baba beheld a spacious cavern, very light,and filled with all sorts of provisions, mer¬chandise, rich stuffs, and heaps of gold andsilver coin, which these robbers had takenfrom merchants and travellers. Ali Babathen went in Search of his asses, and hav¬ing brought them to the rock, took as manybags of gold coin as they could carry,and put them on their backs, coveringthem with some loose faggots of wood,and afterwards (not forgetmg tp say ShutSesame,) he drove his asses beck, thfti,city, and having unload4stable belonging to his cottage, carried jthe bags into his house, and spread the jgold coin out upon the floor before his wife.His wife delighted with possessing somuch money, wanted to count it, butfinding it would take up too much time,she was resolved to measure it; and run¬ning to the house of Ali Baba’s brother,she entreated him to lend her a small mea¬sure. * r • nifiiirotf) Vroiii yd hawolCassim’s wife was very proud and veryenvious: “ I wonder,” said she to herself,u what sort of grain such poor people canhave to measure; but I am determined Iwill find out what they are doing.” So be¬fore she gave the measure, she artfully rub¬bed the bottom with some suet.Away ran Ali Baba’s wife, measured themoney, and having helped her husband tobury it in the yard, she carried back themeasure to her brother-in-law’s house, with¬out perceiving that a piece of gold was leftsticking to the bottom of it.“ Fine doings, indeed!” cried Cassim’swife to her husband, after examining themeasure, “ your brother there who pretendsto be so very poor, is richer than you are,for he does not count his money, but mea¬sures it.Cassim hearing these words, and seeingthe piece of gold, grew as envious as big<5wife, and hastened to his brother, threatenedto inform the Cadi of his wealth, if he didnot confess to him how he came by it. AliBaba, without hesitation, told him the his¬tory of the robbers, and the secret of thecave, and offered him half his treasure ; butthe envious Cassim disdained so poor a sumresolved to have fifty times more than thatout of the robbers cave.Accordingly he rose early next morning,and set out with ten mules loaded with greatchests. He found the rock easily enoughby Ali Baba’s description, and having saidOpen Sesame, he gained admission into thecave; where he found more treasure than heeven had expected to behold from his bro¬ther’s account of it. He immediately be¬gan to gather bags of gold, and pieces of| rich brocades, all which he piled close to thedoor; but when he had got together asmuch, or even more than his ten mules couldpossibly carry, and wanted to get out toload them. The thoughts of his wonderfulriches had made him entirely forget the wordwhich caused the door to open. In vain hetried Bame, Fame, Lame, Tatame, and athousand others; the door remained as im¬moveable as the rock itself, notwithstandingCassim kicked and screamed, till he wasready to drop with fatigue and vexation.Presently he heard the sound of horses’feet,6which he rightly concluded to be the robbers,and he trembled lest he should now fall avictim to his thirst of riches.He resolved however to make one effortto escape ; and when he heard Sesame pro¬nounced, and saw the door open, he sprungout but was instantly put to death by theswords of the robbers.The thieves now held a council, but notone of them could possibly guess by whatmeans Cassim had got into the cave. Theysaw the heaps of treasure he had piled, readyto take away, but they did not miss whatAli Baba had secured before. At lergtli,they agreed to cut Cassim’s body into fourquarters, and hang the pieces within fcave, that it might terrify any one fromfurther attempts, and also determined notto return themselves to the cave, tor fearof being watched and discovered.When Cassim’s wife saw night come onand her husband not returned, she becamegreatly alarmed. She watched at her win¬dow till daybreak, and then went to tellAli Baba of her fears. Cassim had notinformed him of his design of going to thecave, but Ali Baba now hearing of hisjourney thither, did not wait to be desired togo in search of him. na bus bodobl flwaa*He drove his asses to the forest withoutdelay, but was alarmed to see blood near7the rock; and on entering the cave, hefound the body of his unfortunate brotheri cut to pieces and hung up within the door.It was now to late to save him, but hetook down the quarters, and put them upon1 one of his asses, covering them with fag¬gots of wood, and weeping for the miser¬able end of his brother, he regained the city.The door of his brother’s house was open¬ed by Morgiana, an intelligent faithfulfemale slave, who Ali Baba knew was Wor¬thy to be trusted with the secret, he there¬fore delivered the body to Morgiana, andwent himself to impart the sad news toCassim’s wife. The poof5 woman wassadly afflicted, and reproached herself withher foolish envy and curiosity as beingthe cause of her husband’s death; buti Ali Baba having convinced her of the ne¬cessity of being very discreet, she checkedher lamentations, and resolved to leaveevery thing to the management of Mor-1 gpaiuuul bur. ^aielno ion bopouo r,nqiU".ui.Morgiana having washed the body, has¬tened to an apothecary’s and asked for someparticular medicine, saying it was for heimaster, Cassim, who was dangerously ill.She took care to spread the report of Oas-sim’s illness through the neighbourhood,and as they saw Ali Baba and his wifei going daily to the house of fheir h'rotl/erin great affliction, they were not surprisedto hear shortly, that Cassim had died of hisnkUiw qn ‘iuud hm; aooeiq ‘d JjoThe nepct difficulty was to bury him with¬out discovery, but Morgiana was ready to icontrive a plan for that also. She put onher veil, and went to a distant part of thecity very early in the morning, where shefound a poor cobbler just opening his stall,she put a piece of gold into his hand, andtold him he should have another, if hewould suffer himself to be blindfolded andgo with her, carrying his tools with him.Mustapha the cobbler hesitated at first, butthe gold tempted him, and he consented;when Morgiana, carefully covering hiseyes, so that he could not see a step ofthe way, led him to Cassim’s house; andtaking him to the room where the body waslying, removed the bandage from his eyes,and bade him sew the mangled limbs to¬gether. hiaunmaufiin 91U of gnidf yravslMustapha obeyed her orders, and havingreceived twTo pieces of gold, was led blind¬folded the same way back to his stall.Morgiana then covered the body with awinding sheet, sent for the undertaker tomake preparations for the funeral: andCassim was buried with all due solemnitythat very day.Ali Baba now removed his few goodsand all his gold coin that lie hail broughtfrom the cavern, to the house of his de¬ceased brother, of which he took posses¬sion ; and Cassim’s widow received everykind attention both from Ali Baba and hiswife.After an interval of some months, thetroop of robbers again visited their retreatin the forrest, and were completely astonish¬ed to find the body taken away from thecave, and every thing else remaining inits usual order. “We are discovered,”said the captain, “ and shall certainly beundone if we do not adopt speedy mea¬sures to prevent our ruin. Which of you,i! my brave comrades, will undertake tosearch out the villian who is in possession ofour secret ?”One of the boldest of the troop advanc-a ed, and offered himself, and was acceptedi on the following conditions: namely, thatif he succeeded in his enterprise, he was tobe made second in command of the troop,but that if he brought false intelligence, hewas immediatly to be put to death.The bold robber readily agreed to the(:conditions: and having disguised him-fe self, he proceeded to the city. He arrivedthere about day-break, and found the cob-j Ibler Mustapha in his stall, which was■ always open before any shop in the town.u Good morrow, friend,” said the rob-licr, as he passed the sta”you could scarcely see to work by thisjj/ moil dial noniC Indeed, sir,” replied the cobbler, “oldas I am I do not want for good eye-sight,as you must needs believe, when I tell youI sewed a dead body together the otherday where I had not so good a light as 11have now,* yrj7i.“A dead body! exclaimed the robber,who had thus luckily met the very manwho could give him the information he wasin search of. “ However you do not wishto make me believe, that the people of yourcity do impossible things.”“ I tell you,” said Mustapha, in a loudand angry tone, “ I sewed a dead body to¬gether with my own hands.”“ Then I suppose you can tell me alsowhere you performed this wonderful busi-nes&T . rj f iulnmrnao ni Juio-joe obeni odUpon this Mustapha related every par-ticular of his being led blindfolded to theJttise, I )Tor rj/~L £,[1 9f{rr“Well, my friend,” said the robber,“ ’tis a fine story, I confess, but notvery easy to believe: however, if you willconvince me by shewing me the houson talk of I will give you four pbetimes, old as you are;I I 11of efold to make amends for my un¬belief.” m oi 3t3W“ I think,” said the cobbler, after con¬sidering awhile, £< that if you were to blind¬fold me, I would remember every turning wemade, but with my eyes open I am sure 1would never find it out.”Accordingly the robber covered Musta-pha’s eyes with his hankerchief, who ledhim through most of the principal streets,, and stopping by Cassim’s door, said “hereI it is, I went no farther than this house.’’The robber immediately marked thedoor with a piece of chalk; and givinpMustapha his four pieces of gold, dismissedhim.Shortly after the thief and Mustapha had(putted the door, Morgiana coming frommarket, perceived the little mark of whitechalk on the door; and suspecting some¬thing was wrong, directly marked four doorson one side, and five on the other side o£ hermaster’s in exactly the same manner, with¬out telling any one of it. > Tmin iiThe robber meantime rejoined his troopand boasted greatly of his success. Hiscaptain and comrades praised his diligence,and being well armed, they proceeded tothe town in different disguises and inseparate parties of three and four to-gw>0Woiij 'lf‘»iHid •jjninlnv .loddotedl'12It was agreed among them that theywere to meet in the market place at the duskof the evening, and that the captain andthe robber who had discovered the house,were to go there first, to find out to whomit belonged. Accordingly, being arrived inthe streets, and having & lantern withthem, they began to examine the doors,and found, to their confusion and astonish¬ment, that ten doors were marked exactlyalike. The robber, who was the captain’sguide, could not say one word in explan¬ation of this mystery; and when the dis¬appointed troop got back to the forest, hisenraged companions ordered him to be putto death.Another now offered himself upon thesame conditions as the former; and hav¬ing bribed Mustapha, and discovered thehouse he made a mark with dark red chalkupon the door in a part that was not in theleast conspicious, and carefully examinedthe surrounding doors, to be certain that nosuch mark was upon any one of them.But nothing could escape the pryingeyes of Morgiana, scarcely had the robberdeparted when she discovered the red mark;and getting some red chalk, she markedseven doors on each side precisely in thesame place and in the same manner.The robber, valuing himself highly uponthe precautions he had taken, triumphantlyconducted his captain to the spot, but greatindeed was his confusion and dismay, whenhe found it impossible to say which, amongfifteen houses marked exactly alike, was theright one. The captain furious with hisdisappointment, returned again with thetroop to the forest; and the second robberwas also condemned to death.The captain having thus lost two of histroop, judged that their hands were moreactive than their heads in such service; andhe resolved to employ no other of them, butto go himself upon the business.Accordingly he repaired to the city, andaddressed himself to the cobbler Mustapha,who for six pieces of gold readily performedthe same service for him as he had done forthe two other strangers, and the captainmuch wiser than his men, did not amusehimself with setting a mark upon the door,but attentively considered the house, countedthe number of its windows, and passed by itvery often to be certain that he should knowit again.He then returned to the forest and orderedhis troop to go into the town, and buy nine¬teen mules and thirty-eight large jars, onefull of oil and the rest empty.In two or three days the jars were broughtand all things in readiness, and the captain14having put a man into each jar, properlyarmed, the jars being rubbed on the outsidewith oil, and the covers having holes boredn them for the men to breathe through,loaded his mules, and in the habit of an oilmerchant, entered the town in the dusk ofthe evening. He proceeded to the streetwhere All Baba dwelt, and found him sittingin the porch of his house. u Sir,” said heto Ali Baba, u I have brought this oil agreat way to sell, and I am too late for thisday’s market, as I am a stranger in thistown, will you do me the favour to let meput my mules into your court-yard, anddirect me where I may lodge to night.Ali Baba, who was a good natured man,welcomed the pretended oil merchant verykindly, and offered him a bed in his ownhouse; and having ordered the mules to beunloaded in the yard, and properly fed, heinvited his guest into supper. The captainhaving seen the jars placed ready in theyard, followed Ali Baba into the house, andafter supper, was shewn to the chamber wherelie was to sleep.It happened that Morgiana was obligedto sit up lafer that night than usual, to getready her master’s bathing linen for thefollowing morning; and while she was busyabout the fire, her lamp went out, and therewas no more oil in the house.After considering what she could possiblydo for a light, she recollected the thirty-eight jars in the yard, and determined totake a little oil out of one of them for herlamp. She took her oil-pot in her hand,and approaching the first jar, the robberwithin said, “Is it time captain?” Anyother slave, perhaps, on hearing a man inan oil jar, would have screamed out; butthe prudent Morgiana instantly recollectedherself and replied softly, No, not yet, liestill till I call you. She passed on to eachof the jars, receiving the same question andgiving the same answer, till she arrived atthe last, which was full of oil.Morgiana was now convinced that thiswas a plot of the robbers to murder hermaster Ali Baba; so she ran back to theI kitchen, and brought out a large kettle,which she filled with oil, and set it on agreat wood fire; and as soon as it boiled,she went and poured into the jars sufficientof the boiling oil to kill every man withiiikioddm yi-uft ;o .nivfgitaHaving done this, she put out her fireand lamp, and crept softly to her chamber.The captain of the robbers hearing everything quiet in the house, and perceiving nolight any where, arose and went down intothe yard to assemble his men. Coming tothe first jar, he felt the steams of the boiling1B „1 • a,oil; he ran hastily to the rest, and foundevery one of his troop put to death in thesame manner. Full of rage and despair at .having failed in his design, he forced the Silock of a door that led to a garden, and made|>his escape over the walls.On the following morning, Morgianarelated to her master Ali Baba his wonder- -ful deliverance from the pretended oil mer- ■chant and his gang of robbers. Ali Baba sat first could scarcely credit her tale; but )when he saw the robbers dead in the jars,he could not sufficiently praise her courageand sagacity; and without letting any oneelse into the secret, he and Morgiana, thenext night, buried the thirty-seven thievesin a deep trench at the bottom of the gar¬den. The jars and the mules as he had nouse for them, were sent from time to time •to the different markets and sold,While Ali Baba took these measures to 1prevent the public from knowing how he jcame by his riches in so short a time, thecaptain of the forty robbers returned tothe forest, in most inconceivable mortifica¬tion ; and in the agitatioA, or rather con¬fusion, he was in at his success, so contraryto what he had promised himself, he enteredthe cave, not being able, all the way fromthe town, to come to any resolution what todo to Ali Baba.17| The loneliness of the dark place seemeaI frightful to him. Where are you, my brave| lads, cried he, old companions of my watch-| ings, inroads, and labour? What can I deI wi'hout you? Did I collect you to lose youby so base a fate, and so unworthy your| courage V Had you died with your sabres!i in your hands, like brave men, my regrfetI had been less! When shall I get so gal¬lant a troop again ? And if I could, can Iundertake it without exposing so muchI gold and treasure to him, who hath already\ enriched himself out of it? I cannot, Iought not to think of it1, before I have takenaway his life. I will undertake that my¬self, which I could not accomplish with sopowerful assistance : and when I have takencare to secure this treasure from being pil-I laged, I will provide for it new masters and] successors after me, who shall preserve and| augment it to all posterity. This resolution; being taken, he was not at a loss how toexecute it; but, easy in his mind, andj full of hopes, he slept all that night veryquietly. „When he waked early next morning aslie had proposed, he dressed himself, agree-j ably to the project he had in his head, and| went to the town, and took a lodging in a| khan. And as he expected what had hap¬pened at Ali Baba’s might make a great18noise in the town, he asked hjfs host, by iwajof'discourse, what news there were in the city..Upon which the innkeeper told him a greatmany things, which did not concern him infthe least. He judged by this, that the reason |why Ali Baba kept this affair so secret wasfor fear people should know where the trea¬sure lay, and the means of coming at it;and because he knew his life would be soughtupon account of it. And this urged himthe more to neglect nothing to rid himselfof so dangerous a person.The next thing that the captain had todo was to provide himself with a horse, toconvey a great many sorts of rich stuffs andfine linen to his lodging, which he did bya great many journeys to the forest, butwith all the necessary precautions imagin¬able to conceal the place whence he broughtthem. In order to dispose of the merchan¬dizes, when he had amassed them together,he, took a furnished shop, which happenedto be opposite to that which was Cassini’s,which Ali Baba’s son had not long occu¬pied.He took upon him the name of CogiaHoussain, and as a new comer, was, accord¬ing to custom, extremely civil and complai¬sant to all the merchants his neighbours.And as Ah Baba’s son was young andhandsome, and a man of good sense, and19was often obliged to converse with Cogiai Houssain, he soon made them acquainted1 with him. He strove to cultivate his friend¬ship, more particularly when, two or three/days after he was settled, he recognized Ali'Baba, who came to see his son, and stoppedto talk with him as he was accustomed to do;i and when he was gone, he learnt from his! son who he was. He increased his assidu¬ities, caressed him after the most engagingmanner, made him some small presents,and often asked him to dine and sup withhim : and treated him very handsomely.Ali Baba’s son did hot care to lie undersuch obligation to Cogia Houssian withoutmaking the like return; but was so muchstraitened for want of room in his house,that he could not entertain him so well ashe wished: and therefore acquainted hisfather Ali Baba with his intention, andtqldfitm that it did not look well for him to re¬ceive such favours from Cogia Houssairiwithout inviting him again.Ali Baba, with great pleasure, took therent upon himself. Son, said he, to-morrowFriday) which is a day that the shops of'such great merchants as Cogia Houssianand yourself are shut, get him to take awalk with you after dinner, and as yo//come back, pass by my door, and call in .ft will look better to have it happen accident'TOally, than if you gave him a formal invTfaltion. I will go and order Morgianato profvide a supper.The next day, after dinner, Ali Baba's'son and Cogia Houssian met by appointsmerit, and took their walk, and as theyreturned, Ali Baba’s son led Cogia Hous¬sian through the street where his fatherlived; and when they came to the house, hestopped and knocked at the door. This,sir, said he, is my father’s house; who uponthe account I have given him of your friend¬ship, charged me to procure him the honourof your acquaintance: and I desire you toadd this pleasure to those I am already in¬debted to you for.The artful Cogia Houssian would not toohastily accept this invitation, but pretendedhe was not fond of going into company, andthat he had business which demanded his pre¬sence at home. These excuses only madeAli Baba’s son the more eager to take himto his father’s house, and after repeatedsolicitations, the merchant consented to supat Ali Baba’s the following evening.A most excellent supper was provided,which Morgiana cooked in her best manner,as was her usual custom, she carried in thefirst dish herself. The moment she lookedat Cogia Houssian, she knew him to be thepretended oil merchant. The prudentid blAdfitl iLAMorgiana did not say a word to any one ofthis discovery, but sent the other slave intothe kitchen, and waited at table herself; andwhile Cogia Houssian was drinking, sheperceived he had a dagger under his coat.When supper was ended, and the desertand wines on the table, Morgiana went awayi and dressed herself in the habit of a dancinggirl; she next called Abdalla, a faithfulslave, to play on his tabor while she danced.As soon as she appeared at the parlourdoor, her master who was very fond of see¬ing her dance, ordered her to come in andI entertain the guest with some of her bestl dancing. Cogia Houssian was not verywell satisfied with this entertainment, butwas compelled, for fear of discovering him¬self, to seem pissed with the dancing, whilein fact lie wished Morgiana at the devil, andwas quite alarmed Jest he should lose hisopportunity of murdering Ali Baba and hkson.Morgiapa danced several dances with theutmost grace and agility, and then draw¬ing a poinard from her girdle, she perform-,ed many surprising things with it, sometimespresenting the point to one, then at anotherI and then seeming to strike it into her ownbosom. Suddenly she paused, and holdingthe poinard in the right handvhfclddter leftto her master, as if begging some money111, - —22upon which Ali Baba and his son each gaveher a small piece of’ money. She thenturned to the pretended Cogia Houssian,and when he was putting his hand into hispurse, she plunged the poinard into hisheart. '* 'i9&au 'I0rtaJ:" havioo'ioqAli Baba and Ins son frightened at thisaction, cried out aloud. Unhappy wretch!exclaimed Ali Baba, what have you doneto ruin me and my family ? It was to pre¬serve you, not to ruin you, answered Mor-giana ; for see here said she (opening CogiaHoussian’s garment, and showing the dag¬ger), what an enemy you had entertained!Look well at him, and you will find him to beboth the pretended oil merchant, and thecaptain of the gang of forty robbers: andwhat would you have more to persuade youof his wicked design ? Before I saw him,I suspected him as soon as you told me youhad such a guest. I saw him, and younow find that my suspicion was not ground¬less.Ali Baba, who immediately felt the newobligation he had to Morgiana for savinghis life a second time, embraced her : Mor¬giana, said he, I gave you your liberty,and then promised you that my gratitudeshould not stop there, but that I would sooncomplete it. The time is come for Vne togive you a proof of it, by making you my23jaughter-in-law. Then addressing himself■> his son, he said to him, I believe you,on, to be so dutiful a child, that you willot refuse Morgiana for your wife. You«e that Cogia Houssian sought your friend-hip with a treacherous design to take awayay life ; and, if he had succeeded, there isi»o doubt but he would have sacrificed youiso to his revqnge. Consider, that bylarrying Morgiana, you marry the supportf my family, and your own.The son, far from shewing any dislike,dily consented to the marriage; not onlylause he would not disobey his father, buthat his inclination prompted him to it.After this, • they thought- of burying the[aptain of the robbers with his comrades,find did it so privately that nobody knewjny thing of it till a great many yearslifter, when not any one had any concerni the publication of this remarkable his-pry.A few days afterwards, Ali Balia ccle-rated the marriage of his son and Morgiana,ith a sumptuous entertainment; and every(ne who knew Morgiana, said she wasorthy of her good fortune, and highlylommended her master’s generosity towardser.During a twelve-month Ali Baba forborego near the forest, but at length hi;B4curiosity excited him to make another jour¬ney. When he came to the cave, he sawno footsteps of either men or horses; andhaving said Open Sesame, he went in, andjudged by the state of things deposited inthe cavern, that no one had been there sincethe pretended Cogia Houssian had removedthe merchandise to his shop, in the city.Ali Baba took as much gold home as hishorse could carry; and afterwards he carriedhis son to the cave, and taught him thesecret. This secret they handed down totheir posterity, and, using their good fortunewith moderation, they lived in honour andsplendour, and served with dignity some ofthe highest offices of the state.•f

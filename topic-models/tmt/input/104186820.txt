The precise period of Wallace’sbirth is unknown, but it is highly pro.bable that it must have been some timebefore the death of Alexander III. in1286.The mind of Wallace in his youngerdays was directed in its progress to ma¬turity by John Blair, a Benedictine monkat Dundee, who was afterwards his chap-*iain, and lived to record his exploits.It appears, that during the early partof his life, Wallace had resided chieflyin retirement. At what time he first em¬erged from the peace and the improve-3ment of private life is uncertain ; but it ispresumed to haye been about the periodof the battle of Dunbar, where the dis¬cipline of Edward’s soldiers triumphedover the loose violence of the Scottisharmy, as much as his political finesseovercame the wisdom of the Scottish no¬bility in other; spheres of ' on ention.After the humiliation of Scotland, Wal¬lace returned to Dundee, (if in fact bebad been engaged in the war), for thepurpose of studying under the superm*tendance of his tutor, Blair. He beheldthe oppression of his countrymen with; horror and indignation; he sympathized■ with the sufferings of individual?, and hei mourned the degradaiion of his nativel| land. While these sentiments animatedi| his bosom, he was, in an occidental ren¬counter, insulted by a youut Englishman,d son of Selby, the constable of Dundee.,i liiough a stripling, he po^s* ssed incon¬ceivable bodily strength ; he overcameKtj young Selby in a scuffle that ensued,d and killed him with hu wwa dagger,bin presence of a number f his foliow-1 ers. This action expesc.i hi,a to the rageof the English, ccmpeii dm to seekrefuge in retirement fro the punish,merit which would have followed, jlay.{in'ifig slain all Selby's at ten mts who op.4opposed his flight, and being still pursu¬ed very keenly, he went into an inn,exhausted with his exertions. Wallacewas instantly dressed in tne attire of .afemale, and was busily ..employed twirlinghis distaff and humming his song, whenthe’pursuers searched the house whichthey had seen him enter. They were so- )completi ly outwitted by thic device, thatthey did not discover him : and uponretireing from the immediate pursuit, he ifound himself at leisure to concert andidopt measures for mere effectually se- !curing his retreat. Having left the roof |of his kind hostess, he bent his steps fitowards the residence' of a parental uncleat Dunipace.Wallace, after a short stay with his imother at Dunipace, proceeded to Ellers,lie. On their arrival, they learned fromShr Ronald Crawford, the lady’s husbandand elder son had been cruelly murdered jjat Lochmaben by the English, who in- iffested and tyrannised over the whole coun-1try without contiol. The old lady got?a promise of protection from Percy, Ed-}ward’s lord lieutenant; but Wallace scorn-[ed to accept of protection from the handsof those men who had become the toolsof that tyrant’s oppressions. In this si¬tuation of his affairs, he went to live inaeerecy at the house of his paternal uncle*5Sir Richard Wallace of Riccarton, whereHis restless and patriotic averson to theEnglish tyranny permitted him not long toremain. One day he went a fishing, andin the course of his pastime was interrupt¬ed by the insolent rapacity of son>3 ofLord Percy’s followers who happened topass the spot, where he saw the only wea-pon he had was his fishing staff, with thishe beat one ol them to the ground, andhaving wrested the sword from his handhe soon taught the crowd, by whom hewas speedily assailed, that his individualstrength, skill, and intrepidity, were su¬perior to their united force j he killedseveral of the party, and the others fled,confounded at the matchless prowess oftheir single antagonist. He rode hometriumphant to his unde, on a horse leftI by the persons whom he killed or terri¬fied, and now he was inspired with ajust confidence in his own powers by theseexploits, ilis residence with Sir Richardnow becoming' very insecure, he resolv-' ed to devote his mightiest exertions, and1 his life itself, to the deliverance of his- country, ov to the chastisement of its op-j pressors; and, accdfdingly, he destroyedj as many Englsh as came in his way,;1 sparing neither the dignified nor themean. For these noble actions he wasoutlawed by the English, and compelled to6Hv$d during the most inclement seasonsof‘ the year entirely in the open fieldsthe woods and mountains, where he of¬ten wandered subjected to all hardships,that it is possible for human nature tosustain, but animated by a spirit that en¬abled him to bid defiance to the direstcalamities that assailed him. *•The exploits of Wallace were soongenerally known, and attracted the no-tice of many, who, dreading the strata¬gems of Edward to subvert their inde¬pendence had courage to hazard theirlives for the liberty of their country.At the head of such men as these, Wal¬lace performed such exploits as posterityhas surveyed with astonishment. Hewould frequently sally out ol his lurkingplaces, and with a handful of men defeatwhole multitudes. His per^dhal strengthwas extraordinary, and had often beentried } but to this he did not so muchtrust as to stratagem. Expeditious andindefatigable, coutious, though, undaunt¬ed, he eluded the pursuits of his ene¬mies, and never exposed hjmself to num¬bers, but when certain to frustrate theirendeavours, if not to triumph in theirdestruction. The English having proclaim¬ed a justice meeting to he held at the tpwnof Ayr, [18th June, 1^96,] many of theneighbouring landed gentry attended, se-7veral of whom being accused of feiony,were immediately condemned and execu¬ted. Among these were Sir Ronald Craw¬ford, Sheriff of Ayr, and uncle of Wal¬lace, Sir Bryce Blair, Sir Neil Montgo-mery, and many of the barrens of Kyle,Cunningham, Carrick, and Clydesdale.The few who escaped, having informedWallace of this dreadful catastrophe, he,with his usual intrepidity, immediatelyassembled fifty of his followers, secretlyentered Ayr in the night, and set fire tothe place, where many of the Englishwere asleep. The garrison issuing forthfrom the castles fell into an ambush laidfor them, and were all put to the sword.The fort being immediately seized, Wal¬lace marched next morning to Glasgow,when engaging a body of tioops underi the command of Lord Henry Percy, he} completely routed them, and quickly af-l ter took the castle of Stirling, recovered. Argyle and Lorn./ with the town of St., Johnston, and adjacent country, and con-t tinned daily, in short, to do some signali mischief to the English and their friends.Travelling through Angus and Meafns,1 he arrived at Aberdeen, from whichI the English had just made their es-J Cape by sea, apd made himself masterof all the towns of consequence in thenorth. In the n^ean time, Sir Vfalliam/ s^Wallace was, by the majority of the king-com, elected guardian of Scotland, aadvicery in the absence of Baiiol. Thecastle of Dundee was the only place thatwithstood the arms of Wallace in thenorth. While besieging this fort he got jintelligence of the approach of J)e Eng¬lish army, commanded by John Earl ofSurrey, an 1 Sir Hugh Cressingham, andjoined by many disaffected Scots, to the Inumber altogether of about thirty thou¬sand men ; Wallace commanded theburghers, upon pain of death, to prose- Lcute with vigour th.e siege he had begun, j;and he himseifj with ten thousand faith¬ful adherents, marched towards Stirling,and encamped in an advantageous situa¬tion upon a hill above the monastery ofCambusfcsnneth, on the north side of the fForth j which, having no fords at thatplace, was passable only by a woodenbridge. The English army lay on the fsouth of the Fourth ; and their generalsbeing desirous of bringing matters to anaccommodation, sent two Dominicanfiiars with overtures of peace to Wal- jlace. These terms, insulting in the last ;degree to the honour and independence jof Scotland, were rejected with disdain. .** Tell your officers, (said Wallace,) [that we have not come to this place to (sue for peace, that now we are ready tofind and will immediately evince, thatour country is still free.” This answerirritated the English generals, several ofwhom despising Wallace and his follow¬ers, presumptuously exclaimed, “ They areall our own, let us instantly charge them.”The bridge formerly mentioned, overwhich it behoved the army to pass, wasboth narrow and weak, and the Scot.ishcarpenter, who shortly before had beenemployed to repair it, had by Wallace’sdesire, cut the main beams of it halfthrough, and thereby' rendered it incap¬able of supporting a great weight. Urg¬ed by the impetuosity of Cressinghacn,Surrey gave orders to the army to marchalong the bridge ; and Sir MarmadukeTwenge, a gentlemen distinguished for4 valour and resolution, led the van, andboldly advanced at the foot of thehill, on which the Scots had drawn uptheir army in order of battle. HereWallace remained till he saw as manyof the English had got over as he thoughthe could safely encounter, but so farfrom making a formidable opposition,he gradually retreated as Sir Marmaduke> advanced. The English commander pur-Isued with vigour j but soon discoveredthat there was not a standard of his coun¬trymen in his rear. While some of theScots seemed to flee before him, thegreater part having taken an unfrequent¬ed road, completely intersepted his re¬treat, and the bridge havirig brokendown by the immense weight of so manyarmed men, vast quantities wese dmwnedin the river. All the English who had jcrossed the river, to the number of six or ;seven thousand, were put to the sword, ex¬cept Sir Mar mad uke and a very few, whostood on the north side of the water, andmade their escape by swimming acrossthe river. Surrey, during all this time,had the galling "mortification of seeing hismen drowned and slain, without being ableto afford them the smallest relief. As soonas Twenge joined Surrey, he advised himto set on fire the remaining part of thebridge, to prevent the victorious Scots from !pursuing and harassing their disheartenedarmy. This expedient proved of little use,for the Great Steward of Scotland and theEari of Lennox, having previously postedthemselvesman ambush, at a short distancefrom the English, came f’rc'm behind Themountains, as souh as they asceitained theevent of the day, charged the retiring Earl,put Him to flight, and pursued him withsuch vigour, that with difficulty he escapedto Berwick.This glorious battle, so disastrous to theEnglish army, was fought on the 13th Sep-ft.pItember. Sir Andrew Murray was the on-ly Scotchman of note that lost his life, al¬though many of the English commandersfell this day. This victory was evinced'tobe complete in its effects and consequen¬ces. No Englishman durst remain inScotland ; and all those Scots, who, forreasons of policy or of baseness, had deser¬ted to the English interest, now submittedto Wallace, and hailed him as the deli¬verer of their country. And thus, in a-bout fourteen months after the king hadbeen deposed and his kingdom subdued,and obliged to own a foreign prince astheir hereditary king, did Wallace, tillthen a private and obscure gentleman, un-accustomed to martial exploits, withoutmoney or arms, but such as he took fromthe enemy, and with only a handful ofmen, restore the nation to its ancient liber-ty and independence.Although the plunder taken at thebattle of Stirling was not inconsiderable,yet so many armies ranging tlyough allparts of the kingdom, occasioned a greatscarcity, and a general famine was seri.ously apprehended. To prevent this ca¬lamity, Wallace issued orders, command¬ing all Scotsmen capable of bearingarms to be ready po join him by turns.The men thus raised were formed intoregiments, and bad officers appointedover them. Having thus arranged alldomestic affairs, and collected as manymdn as he thought necessary for hispurpose, he, under himself, as com¬mander, appointed Andrew Murray, sur-named the noble, son of Andrew Mur- |ray, who shortly before fell at the battleof Stirling, and entered England on theeighteenth of October. The inhabitants«f Norlhurnberland, alarmed at his ap.proach, leaving the country defenceless, ftied with their families and effects toNewcastle. Upon this Wallace and hisarmy halted, or rather seemed to retreat.The country people obseiving their re¬trograde motion, returned to their hou¬ses, and were all unawares surprised byparties of tire Scottish army, who ravag- |ed the whole country between Tyne and SiDervent, for the space of twenty-three jdays. A body of fresh troops advancing 1now to the borders, some of the formerwere sent home, and had the peculiar sa¬tisfaction of carrying back with them totheir friends the welcome news of theirvarious success, particularly the plenty ,of food they had procured in the land oftheir enemies. But Wallace did net thinkproper to attack them, or to push hissuccesses farther: he had alrea !y done13had at an easy rate, obtained muchglory to his countrymen, and reflecteddistinguished lustre on the Scottisharms.The fame of Wallace, and the splen¬did victories which he had gained both inScotland and in England, spread abroad,and attracted the attention of the courtsof’England and France. Philip the Fair,the French monarch, heard oi his succes¬ses with joy : but Edward the I. king ofEngland observed them with decided dis¬pleasure ; he felt much at being outstrip,ed by one, whom he accounted his in¬ferior. The constable and marshall ofEngland, the earls of Gloucester, Surrey,and Arundel, and a great majority of theearls and barons of the kingdom agreedthat a large army should be Instantlyraised, and that within eight days all theforces they could collect should assembleat Newcastle. This meeting took placeas appointed, and the army was foundto consist of four thousand and five hun¬dred cavalry, and upwards of a hundredthousand infantry. The prince and fore-said noblemen headed this immensebody, marched against the Scots, reliev¬ed the castle of Roxburgh, which Wal¬lace was besieging, and took possessionof Berwick, which the Scottish garrisonhad abandoned as untenable j and hav-uing proceeded thus far, they received or¬ders from Edward 10 halt, till he himself,having now settled his affairs abroad,should come home, and put an end to thedisturbances in Scotland.Edward having arrived in England onthe 21st of March, immediately sent let- ]ters to Wallace, replete with insult and a-buse. He told him that he durst not haveattempted to revolt in Scotland, far less aninvasion on England, had he himself beenin the island. Sir William received Ed- jward’s messenger with that dignity which jbecame his present situation, and replied,that he had more reason to take the advan¬tage of’ Edward’s absence to deliver hiscountry from servitude, than he of the di¬visions cf a free and independent peopleto enslave them : he added, that he had in- jvaded England to repay the is;juries done :to Scotland $ that he meant to keep his Eas- j-ter in the same country, and that he invit- |ed his highness to that feast. He punctual- 1ly did what he promised. Edward had a igreat army to oppose him, but Sir Wil¬liam’s courage, which had been conspicu- ■ous all along, did not fail him here ; with ihis usual intrepidity, he collected his cho¬sen troop?, rallied, and came in view of theiimighty monarch near Stanmore.Edward’s army appeared to the Scots to115be incredibly numerous, the armour ofthe soldiers glittering, the equipage of theofficers rich and elegant/'and the sound oftheir trumpets, and noise of their drums,pompous and terrible. Yet such was theardour and bravery of many in the Scot¬tish army, that they requested leave fromtheir guardian«to go a pickering, a:id thusby conspicuously evincing their undaunt¬ed intrepidity, to aim at the honour ofknighthood. But this favour Wallace wasby no means disposed to confer: he issueda proclamation, commanding all his men,upon pain of death, to keep their ranks,to march with gravity, and to attempt no¬thing without his orders. Edward obser¬ved, and admired the order, discipline,and formidable appearance of the same en¬emy that he Had been hitherto accustomedto despise. His own veteran and experi¬enced soldiers had not by this lime arrivedfrom Flandejs, and in his situation hethought it improper to hazard his own glo¬ry, the lives of his nobles, and the forfei¬ture of his claim, with an undisciplinedthough numerous militia, against a smallbut resistless army, in which every officerand every soldier acted the part of a hero.Edward therefore wisely retired, andWallace with no less prudence, checkedthe impetuous courage of his men, who,16seeing the enemy retreat, were eager tofollow and charge their rear. He againupon pain of death, disctiarged every onefrom stirring from the ranks, and told hisfollowers ‘‘ that they had done enoughwhen they stood their ground, and kept Stheir countenance in the j^esence of sucha power, which one would thought wasable to have swallowed them up : that thiswas in effect a victory, anil too much themore glorious, that they had gained it w ith- jout drawing their swords.” This speech jbeing circulated through the army, had anagreeable influence upon all their min.*!s ;the officers alighted from their horses, and ithe whole army prostrated themselves on ''the gtound while, according to the customof the day, they, sung the praises of St.Andrew the patron of Scotland, and re¬turned thanks to St.. Cuthbert, on whose !feast, and in some measure by whose inter- |cession, they attributed their courage hav* fl-ing been roused, and their enemies put ;to flight.The glory of Sir William Wallace was inow at its height; and as, by numerousand gallant exploits, he had become theadmiration of Europe, and the terror ofEngland, and the darling of his country¬men-j so he was the object of the envy,jealousy, and fear of the nobility.17 ^John CummineofBadenochandRobertBruce earl of Carrick, both of the bloodroyal, and of aspiring dispositions, 'wereafraid that he would at length usurp thesovereignty, and sie*e upon the crown, t®which they had a just and legal title.These considerations made the one joinopenly with the enemy, and the other toact but faintly against him.“ Thus did Scotland, by the wonderfulconduct and vigilance of its Guardian,enjoy peace in the mid?t of war, and thepeople, guarded by repeated victories overtheir enemies, securely cultivated the form-eily neglected soil, and dispersed plentyover the land ; while at the same time the[ more powerful nobles, inebriated with envyand jealousy, outwardly professed all thegratitude that was due to the admired at-chievements of their deliverer, but secretlyconspired his ruin ; in order to effect inis,caused rumours to be spread abroad, inti¬mating that he designed to usurp thecrown : and that if an usurper must reign,a great and mighty monarch, though aforeigner, was preferable to an upstart ofyesterday.By this time, the formidable armyI which Edward had left at Flanders, wasreturned to England » and he to strength¬en it by the addition of all the forces1.8which that kingdom, with Ireland andWales, could raise, had gratified his noldes,respecting the privileges for which theyb*.d long contended: and now their jealou¬sies being completely removed, they mar¬ched with him against the Scots, with cou¬rage and alacrity. To oppose this formi¬dable power Wallace had not above thirtythousand, including both horse and foot;yet in that high state of discipline whichthey had attained, and animated with thatpatriotic ardour which had long markedtheir conduct, they would doubtless havewithstood their enemies, had they beencommanded by the guardian alone ; butunfortunately, two men, of acknowledgedbravery indeed, but,—3s were the greaterpart of lh£ nobility and their immediatedependants, for the reasons already no-ticed,—his secred enemies, divided withhim the command.In this potitLon did they remain at Fal¬kirk, which is situated about eleven milesfrom Stirling, till the army of Edward ap¬peared on the22d day of July, after havingreduced several castles, and penetratedthus far into the heart of the kingdom.And now was the time that the animositiesthat unhappily subsisted between the com¬manders should have been entirely banish¬ed j but, unfortunately for Scotland, this19was not the ease. Each of them wouldt have th<* honour of going first upon tfcahead of the vc-.i; Wallace, because he wasguardian of the kingdom ; Cumine, on ac¬count of his more numerous vassalage androyal birth; and Stewart, because he actedthat day in the place of his brother, theI Lord High Steward himself, whose vassalsor military tenants would' obey be com¬mands but what he gave them ; and he issaid to have stood so much upon this punc¬tilio of honour, that he upbraided Wallaceto his face, charged him with ambition andpride, and compared him to the owl in thefable, which had nothing originally of itsogn, but begged a feather of every bird,and thus having acq >ed rich and gayplumage, pretended to beauty and supe-uioiity above all others.It is easy to conjecture what must have'been the result of a battle begun at suchan unfortunate period, and in such a man-ner. While the fatal debate was agitatedwith the greatest heat, Edward, althoughhe had that very morning got a fall fromhis horse, by which two of his ribs werebroken, caused a charge to be sounded,rhe Scots were soon routed, and they lostupwards of ten thousand men. Sir JohnJumine, with those under his command,vent away without fighting at all: Sir20John Stewart fought bravely, and diedhonourably, as did all his dependants.And the guardian, who, in the beginningof the action, had just sufficient leisure toaddress this short speech to his men, “ Ihave brought you to the king, fly if youcan,” did all that pould be expected fromthe greatest commander in the world.Thus Wallace, by the means to whichwe have already adverted, was obliged toretreat; on which account, and becauseof the numerous forces he brought to thefield, he was branded as the main authorof all the losses which his country hadsustained.This lino of conduct, however, he wassoon after disposed to follow: for by SirJohn Cummins’s conduct, both before andalter the battle, and by the conversationvtiic-i he afterwards had with RobertBruce Earl of Carraik, he plainly under¬stood that these great men were actuatedby mere jealousy, a passion, of all otherstha least easily checked ; and that bothhaving a view to the crown, would alwaysoppose, at least would never heaitiiy con¬cur with one, who, in their apprehension,bad merit and ambition enough to set it onhis own head.After the glorious victory obtained inthe beginning of the compaign 1302, by21the Scots, in the vicinity of lloslin, whenhe had reason to qpnciude that his countrystood not so much in need 5f his seivice.It is said, in his voyage to France, hefought with and made prisoner, the famousFrench pirate, Thomas de Longueville,commonly called the Red Reiver ; andthat he was heartily welcomed, and verymuch caressed by Philip the Fair.At a time when their services wereagain required, Sir William Wallace andhis unconquerable friends appeared a-gain in the field, in opposition to that' irresistible army, upon the head of whichI King Edward marched triumphantly1 through, and a second time subduednearly the whole kingdom of Scotland.I King Edwaid had got reason to dread: our hero ; that Prince did not think| himself an absolute conqueror while hesurvived. But Wallace was not, as «.thers, to be awed into submission, byi fines, forfeitures, or threats ; he there-Ijfore courted him with large and mag.nificent promises of honours and wealth,] places and pensions—but in vain—histiconstant answer, both to his intimatei friends, and to the emissaries of KingnEdward, who addressed him on the sub-|ject was, “ that he owed his life to, andi would willingly lay it down for his coun*try j that should all Scotchmen but him-22seif submit to the king of England, he ne-|ver would ; nor would he yield allegianceto any power, except the king of Scotlandhis rightful sovereign.”Since, therefore, neither threats nor jbribes nor example, neither open force nor isecret stratagem, could conquer the invin« tcible soul of our undaunted hero. Edward tbethought him of the traitor Sir John Mon- i:teith, one of those in whom he placed the ;tmost unbounded confidence, who broughta party of Englishmen upon him, as he layconcealed in the neighbourhood of Glas¬gow. These having immediately appre¬hended him, carried him to London, byorders of king Edward. As this misfor¬tune, the greatest which at this juncture fcould befal the kingdom of Scotland, was |:iinexpressibly afflicting to all its sincere f;friends and honest defenders, so it gave joy ifand pleasure to all ranks of people in Eng-land. They now imagined t’ 'f the war fwas at an end ; yet even the j 3 could l;not but pily the hard fate of ^gjy so t.renowned.When he arrived in London, he was con- !•ducted to and lodged in the house of one!!William Delect, in Fenchurch street. Theknext day he was brought on horseback to tWestminster, attended by several knights.the mayor, sheriffs, and aldermen of the pcity, with many other persons of eminence. 23and rank ; in presence of all whom he wasseated on the south bench of the great hall,and either because they wished the peopleto believe that he aspired to the crown ofScotland, or because it was reported thathe had formerly boasted that he deservedto wear a diadem, in that place they crown-’ ed him with laurel, while Sir Peter Malloryi impeached him with high treason. ToI this charge he boldly replied, “ That a1 traitor he never was, nor could be, to the,j| King of England.” The other crirpes forl which he was indicted, such as burning oftowns, storming of castles, killing the Eng¬lish, See, he frankly acknowledged, but de¬nied that they were crimes, unless mista¬ken loyalty to one’s sovereign, with defer-/lence to whom, and in whose name he had4ever acted—zeal for the just rights and li-berties of one’s native country, by the^community of which he was created a ma-. (jgistrate—and resisting the encroachmentsrjof a foreign government and tyrannicalBurpation—shall deserve to be brandedwith that odious name. However, theseheroic virtues were voted crimes ; and theprisoner, notwithstanding he had never ac¬knowledged or submitted to the laws of1. JEnglaud, was tried by them, and condemn¬ed to be hanged, drawn ani quartered, andjwhilst alive, to hsfve his bowels cut out j all24uhich was executed with thf utmost seve¬rity, or rather relentless barbarity.It is doubtless if ever any country pro¬duced a hero similar to Wallace. Wal¬lace, only a private gentleman, the secondbrother of a Scots laird, who—though hehad martial England to contend with, andambitious Edward, who had spread terrorin other nations by the power of his arms—wrought the salvation of his country,and rescued its liberties, its ancient rightsand privileges from the else certain de- Istruction which brooded over them, with |few of the nobility and commonalty to jsupport him or support his cause, till byexploits incredible for their greatness hewrought them into belief, that under himthey would prove invincible. No manever attempted more than lie, yet non6?was more Cautious, or better understoodthe arts of stratagem. Untutored himself,,:he taught the whole nation to be soldiers,,)and disciplined them so admirably, that hadiiit been thought proper to have .carried oftihis plan, Scotland could always afford atilea»t thirty thousand men ready for anyenterprise whatever, and that too without:being chargeable to the government, ol,depopulating the country,the endf

I am a littleunfortunate child ;It‘s a cold rainy night,and I am;wet to the skin,And 1 have lost my way,And, &c.so pray let me in.7The maid took compassion,and struck up a light, ~She'open’d the door,and the boy stood in sight,He had wings on his shoulders,all drooping with wet,His bow and his arrows,His bow, &cbetween them was set."She.stirred up the fire,sat down by bis side,Site took a clean napkinthe wet from him dryTd.And chofted him all over,to keep out the cold air.And from with her hand she wrung,And with &c.' the wet out of his hair,Then out of his quiver,an arrow he drew,He touched the string,and so twang went the bow,It went into her bosom,therefore to present her,A sting of a Hornet,8A sting, &c.no sharper could enter,Then up jumps the Archer,*s brisk as a bee,I wish you much joymv fair one, said be;Mv bow is not damaged,neither is my dart.But you may tind some trouble,But &c‘ • r♦>in beanrtg ^ smait.FINIS.

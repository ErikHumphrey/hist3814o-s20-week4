bid her haste and come away ;In sweetest smiles herself adorn,And add new graces to the morn !.O hark, my love ! on ev’ry spray.Each feather’d warbler tune* his lay ;6'Ti* beauty fires tlie ravish’d throng,And love inspires the melting song:Then let my raptur’d notes arise.For beauty darts from Nanny’s eyes,And love my rising bosom warms.And fills my soul with sweet alarms.O come, my love •' thy Colin’s layWith rapture calls, O come; away !Come, while the Muse this wreath shall twinAround that modest brow of thine.O ! hither haste, and with thee bringThat beauty blooming like the spring,Those graces that divinely shine,And charm this ravish’d breast of mine !/ had a Horse.1 had a horse, and ! had nae msir,I gat it frae my daddie ;My purse was light, and my heart was sair,But my wit it was fu’ ready.So I bethought me on a time,Outwittens o’ my daddie,To fee mysel to a Lawland laird,YVha had a bonnic lady.I wrote a letter, and thus began:Madam, be not oftetided ;I’m owre the lugs in love wi’ you,And I carena though ye kend it:7For I get little frae the laird,And far less frae my daddy.Yet I wad blithely be the manWad strive to please my lady.*She read my letter, and she leugh;“ Ye needna been sae blate, man.Ye might hae come to me yoursel,And tauld me a’ your state, man:lYe might hae come to me yoursel,Ou twit ness o’ ony body,jHnd made John Croukston o’ the laird.And kiss’d his bonnie lady.”Then she pat siller in my purse.We drank wine in a cogie ;She fee’d a man to rub my horse,And vow, but 1 was vogie !idut I ne’er gat sae sair a flegI Since I cam frae my daddie;The laird cam, rap, rap !

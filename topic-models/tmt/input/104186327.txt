ashamed,She had no will of such a guest,To lose her pains and be so blamed.Now good Saint Paul., said Magdalene,For that you arc a learned man,Go and convince this woman then,For 1 have done all that I can ;Sure if she were in hell, I doubtThey would not keep her long there,But to the gate would put her out,And send her back to be elsewhere.Then went the good apostle Paul,To put the wife in better

And of all sins must be made free.Saint Peter then, no thanks to you,1? That so you were rid of your fears,t It was Christ’s gracious look, I trow,That made you weep those bitter tears.The door of mercy is not closed,I may get grace as well as ye,It is not so as ye supposed,I will be in in spite of thee.But wicked wife, it is to late,Thou should’st have mourn’d on earth,Repentance now is dut of date :It should have been before thy death •Thou mightest then have turned wrathTo meuy then, and mercy great,But now the Lord is very loth,And all thy cries not worth a jot.Ah!

Lord.That 1 may be refreshed withal,It will not help enough afford.Fiic gates of mercy now are closed,And thou canst hardly enter in :It is not so as thou supposed,For thou art deadly sick in sin.’Tis true indeed, my Lord most meek,My sore and sickness I do feel:Yet thou the lame didst truly seek,Who lay long at Bethseda’s pool,Of many that thee never sought,H22Like to the ] coi Samaritan ;Whom thou unto thy fold hast brought,Even as thou didst the widow of Nain ;Most gracious God, didst thou uot hidAll that were weary ccmc to thee,uehold, 1 come! even overloadith sin, have mercy upon me.The issues of thy soul are great,Thou art both leprous and unclean,To be with me thou art not fit,Go from me then, let me alone.Let me thy garments once but touch,My bloody issue shall be whole,It will not cost thee very much.To save a poor distressed soul,Speak thou the word, I shall be whole,One look of the shall do me good,Save now, good Lord, my silly soul,Bought with thine own most precious bloodLet me alone none of my bloodWas ever shed for such as thee,It was my mercy, patience good.Which from damnation made thee free.It is confest thou hadst been just,Altho* thou had condemned me,But O thy mercies still do last,To save the soul that trusts in thee;Let me not then condemned be.Most humbly, Lord I thee request,Of sinners all none like to me,So much the more thy praise shall last-Thy praising me is not perfite,My saints shall praise me evermore.In sinneis I have no delight,Such sacrifice I do abhor.Then she unto the Lord did say,At footstool of thy grace I’ll lye,Sweet Lord my God, say me not nay,For if I perish here I’ll die.Poor silly wretch, then speak no more,Thy faith, poor soul, hath saved thee ;Enter thou in unto my glore,And rest thro’ all eternity.flow soon our Saviour these words said,A long white robe to her was given;And then the angels did her lead,Forthwith within the gates of heaven :A laurel crown set on her head,Spangle ! with rubies and with gold rA bright white palm she always had.Glorious it was for to behold ;Her face did shine like to the sun,Like threads of gold her hair hang down,.Her eyes like lamps unto the moon.Of precious stones rich was her crown.Angles and saints did welcome her.The heavenly choir did sing, rejoice;King David with his harp was there:riie silver bells gave a great noise.Such music and such melodyWas never either heard or seen,When this poor saint was placed so high,24And of all sins made freely clean ;But then when thus she was possest,And looked back on all her fears ;And that she was come to her rest,Free’d from all sins, and all her tears.She from her head did take the crown,Giving all praise to Christ on high,Afiid at his feat she laid it down.For that the Lamb had made her free.Now doth she sing triumphantly,And shall rejoice for evermore,O’er death and liell victoriously,With lasting pleasures laid in store.CONCLUSION.Of w?ee or Keith 1 make an end,And do these lines with this conclude,Let none their lives in sin now spend,But watch and pray, be doing good,Despondent souls do not despair,Repent, and still believe in Christ,His mercies, which last for evermore.Will save‘‘the souls that in him trust,

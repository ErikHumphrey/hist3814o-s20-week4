Oh, Farewell!Farewell, for how sweetlyEach sound meets mine ear ;The wild bee and butterfly,They may rest here.Hark, hark, they are hum,How it blends with the deep convent bell,’Tis too lovely for me,Farewell,—Oh, Farewell.THE MACGREGOR’S GATHERING.The moon’s on the lake, and the mist’s on the brae,And the clan has a name that is nameless by day ;Our signal for fight, which from monarchs we drew.Must be heard but by night in our vengeful haloo;Then haloo, haloo, haloo, Gregalach.7If they rob us of name and pursue us with beagles,Give their roofs to the flames, and their flesh to theeagles,Then gather, gather, gather, Gregalach.While there’s leaves in the forest, and foam on theIMacgregor, despite them, shall flourish for ever.jGlenorchy’s proud mountain, Colchum and her towers,Glenstrae and Glenlyon no longer are ours ;—■| We’re landless, landless, landless, Gregalach.Through the depths of Loch Katrine the steed shallcareer,O’er the peak of Benlomond the galley shall steer,And the rocks of Craig Royston like icicles melt,Ere our wrongs be forgot, or our vengeance unfelt,Then vengeance, vengeance, vengeance, Gregalach.’TWAS MERRY IN THE HALL.Now ancient English melodiesAre banish’d out of doors,And nothing’s heard in modern days.But Signoras and Signors.Such airs I hate,Like a pig in a gate.Give me the good old strain,When ’twas merry in the hall,The beards wagged all,We shall never see the like again.We shall never see the like again.river.8On beds of down our dandies lay,And waste the cheerful morn,While our squires of old would rouse the dayTo the sound of the bugle horn.And their wives took careThe feast to prepare ;For when they left the plain.Oh, ’twas merry in the hall,The beards wagged all,We shall never see the like again:We shall never see the like again.’Twas then the Christmas tale was told.Of goblin, ghost, or fairy,And they cheer’d the hearts of the tenants oldWith a cup of good canary ;And they each took a smackAt the cold black jack,Till the fire burn’d in their brainOh, ’twas merry in the hall,The beards wagged all—May we all see the like again,May we all see the like again.

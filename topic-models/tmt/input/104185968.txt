Lot heroes chase the phantom fame,, Peru’s rich ore let miser’s claim,|i My only wish, my dearest aim.Is that sweet nymph of Busbie, 0.ALICE GRAY.She’s all my fancy painted her,She’s lovely, she’s divine ;But her heart it is another’s,She never can be mine.Yet loved I as man never loved,A love without decay ;—Oh, my heart—my heart is breakingFor the love of Alice Gray.Her dark brown hair is braided o’erA brow of spotless white ;Her soft blue eye now languishes—Now flashes with delight.The hair is braided not for me,The eye is turn’d away ;—Yet my heart—my heart is breakingFor the love of Alice Gray.I’ve sunk beneath the summer’s sun.And trembled in the blast;But my pilgrimage is nearly done,The weary conflict’s past.8And when the green sod wraps my grave,May pity haply say,Oh his heart—his heart was brokenFor the love of Alice Gray.ENGLAND, EUROPE’S GLORY.There is a land amidst the waves,Whose sons are famed in story ;Who never were, or will be slaves,Nor shrink from death and glory.Then strike the harp and bid it swell.Admiring worlds adore ye ;Shout blessings on the land we dwell.To England, Europe’s glory!Blest land, beyond all lands afar,Encircled by the waters ;With lion-hearted sons in war,And beauty’s peerless daughters.Go ye, whose discontented heartsDisdain the joys before ye ;Go seek a home in foreign parte,Like England, Europe’s glory.• .flffffU dj I 'll > i .; leisfd edi ni < -ddn.-n(ouob /heart er egnn'iirgliqJr ^JoiRnoo 'nm

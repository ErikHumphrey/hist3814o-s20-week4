On the 18th of August, he was joinedby Cameromof Lochiel with his clan; by M-Don-ald of Clanronald with his clan ; by the clan ofthe Stuarts of Afrpin ; and the clans of M*Don-alds of Keppoch, Glengary, and Glencoe. Herethe Marquis of Tullihurdine, whose rank entitledhim to the rearing of the standard, flung upon themountain breeze, that “ meteor flag,’1 which wassoon to spread woe and terror over the peacefulvales of Hrituin. It was a large banner pf silk,with a white space in the middle with the motto,At Lkngtii TiUD.MitnrAN r. The appearance ofthe standard was hailed by a burst of pipe-music,and enthusiastic shouts. Tullihurdine then reada manifesto in the name of King James VlII.,with a commission of Regency, in favour of hisson Charles. In the evening M‘Donald of Kep.pocli arrived himself with fiOO men, having com¬menced hostilities In their march to join him, byattacking tvvo companies of the Royal Scots, whomthey made their prisoners, and presented to thePrince as a happy omen of his future success.Ry this time, the government was informed thatthe.Prince had landed in the Highlands, and sentstrict order* to Sir John Cope, general of theking's forces in Scotland, to take all possible careto prevent him from making his party formidable,and if possible to take him alive or dead; and asan inducement to this, u reward of £30,000 wasL5«set on l»|s head. Cope having, collected all Idsforce*-, and armed the militia, marched for theHighlands along the east coast in quest of thejPrince, who, not choosing to risk a battle in his:infant state of afT^irs, crossed the mountains byj Blair of Athole, and entered Perth without resis-| tance. Here he immediately proclaimed his far,I tlwr, James Ilf. King of Great Britain, t^n thej 7th September he sent a detachment to Dundee| to proclaim his father as king.The Prince set out from Perth on the I 1th,i| and crossed the Forth on the 13th at the ford of,the Frew, about four miles from Stirling, wherehe found no opposition to prevent him from taking!this decisive and inftepid step. Charles spentthe night at Bannockburn House, from whence hepent a message to the Magistrates of Stirling, whosubmitted to him, and sent the provisions he de-Imandtd, On the 15th. Charles proceeded to Fal¬kirk, where Ids army lay ail night among somebroom to the east of Call tmier House. Here theKarl of Kilmarnock informed Charles, that Gard-i iner’s dragoons intended to dispute the passage,i of Linlithgow Bridge. He dispatched 900 welli armed Highlanders to attack them, but the dra-, goons did not wait to come to Idows—they retiredl to Kirkliston, and the Highlanders entered Lin-il lithgow without disturbance; On the morning ofli the 17th, the rebel army proceeded to Edinburgh,•lit end on reaching the village of Corslorphine, depu-.I ties arrived from the city to treat about a capiluLillation To .whom the Prince replied, that hemould not treat with his subjects.

They came down by a sort of valley, or jhollow, that w inds through the farm of Kingati- |head. Not a whisper was heard amongst themWhen they were near the morass, some dragoonswho stood upou the other side as an advancedguard, called out, “ Who's there r" The High¬landers made no answer,' hut marched oh. Thedragoons, soon perceiving who the were, fired theirpieces, and rude off to give the alarm.At break of day, general Cope took the firstline of the rebel army, which was formed in ordero1 battle, at the distance of two hundred pacesfrom his army, for hushes.

LordGeorge dispatched his aid-de camp to the sc^'oTrdwhich the Prince conducted in person, to see thatit passed without noise or confusion. Having ex¬amined the line, and seen that every thing wde asit should be, in returning to Lord George hefound thp Prince at the head of the column, acflKHn*paied by Lord Nairn, just as he was begining toenter the marsh. Ixmi George Murray, at thehead of the first line, did not give the English timeto recover from their surprise. IJe advanced withsuch rapidity that General Cape had hardly timeto form his troops in order of battle, when theHighlanders rushed on sword in hand. They hadbeen frequently enjoined to aim at tire noses ofthe horses with their swords, without minding theriders ; as the natural movement of a horse, wound-*fd in tlie face, is to wheel round J and a few hor*ses wounded in that manner, are sufficient tothrow whole squadron into such disorder, that itis impossible afterwards to rally it. They fol¬lowed this advice most implicitly, and the Rnglish| cavalry were instantly thrown into confusion.The victory began, with the battle, among theCamerons. .That spirited clan, notwiihstandingtheir exposure to the cannon, and although recci-1 ved with a discharge of musketry by the artilleryI guard, ran on with undaunted speed, and wen*i first up to the trout of the enemy.

Tin# Ipjw ol the. ^ligfjlijisjfcfs1?in this action was only 30 men killed, including ;3 officers, and about 70 or 80 wounded.' ‘The army of the Prince after this victory in- ,icreased in members every day, and soon amounted 1to from 4 to 5000 men He then became impa- jtient to enter England, and for that purpose !assembled a council of all the chiefs, where im iopinion was approved of bv no one. King George |had returned to London, and alarmed at. the de- ■feat of General Cope he recalled the English itroops from Flanders. The chiefs represented to ihim that nothing could be more ridiculous than ito attempt an invasion of England with such a jhandful of men, when it was defended by 50 thou¬sand regular troops, and numerous militia ; someof whom told him, that they had taken arms, and Irisked tbeir fortunes and their lives only to seat !Vim on' the throne of Scotland. The Prince 5ipretending that he had received letters from seve- Iral English lords, assuring him, that he should 1find them in arms on the borders, ready to join |him with a considerable force, the chiefs of the Iclans at length yielded, and gave their assent to !the proposition. The army lay in the town of fDalkeith till the 3d November, when they setout for England ; hut before their departure, twovessels, laden with money, arms, military stores,and six Swedish field pieces, with a detachment 1of French artillery-men, joined them there. Themarch was judiciously planned, and well exe¬cuted the army was formed into 3 columns,each of which took a separate road on setting outfrom Dalkeith, with the view of keeping theenemy’ ignorant of the place where the PrinceIntended to enter England. This plan succeededso well, that General Wado, who was at New¬castle with 11,(K)0 men, including a carp of Swiss18troop% continuerl to cover that city. Secrecywas so well observed, that hardly any person inthe rebel army had the least idea where thejunction would take place; and the march wasarranged and executed with such precision, thatthere was not an interval of 2 hours between thearrival of the different columns, at a short dis-tanee from Carlisle.On the 10th November trenches were openedbefore this place, under the orders of the' Duke ofPerth, at the distance of SO yards from the walls ;but having learned that Marshal Wade was onhis march to force them to raise the siege of Car¬lisle, the Prince left the Duke of Perth tdcbnductthe siege, and marched himself against Wade; Itbeing of the greatest importance to give battlebefore they advanced into England, in order topreserve a free communication with Scotland.The Prince, after waiting some days at Bramp¬ton, received positive information-that Wade hadabandoned Hexham, and fallen back upon New¬castle, on which he refurned to Carlisle. On hisreturn, the Prince had the satisfaction to receivethe keys of the city. It surrendered the 3d dayafter the opening of the trenches, by threateningto fire red-hot balls upon the town, and reduce itto ashes ; but they did not fire a single shot, lestthe garrison should become acquainted with thesmallness of their cannon, which might have en¬couraged them to defend themselves. The townI first proposed lo surrender without°the aastle;■‘i hut as the Prince refused to receive the one with-;i out the other, the inhabitants became alarmed,i and obliged the garrison to j»in in the capitula-i tion.'I'he Prince’s army on being mustered at Car-li lisle was fouiui to amount to having tie-i - ,14in ijl^^inarqU. f«>qReaving a sranil gar^'VD:v nt .Carlisle, he sent ior-ftfird hi? jjavgdrj to I’enEith on dht>(20t,h.;,ar«l nextfa# at th§ h,erul of tJj«. ii;|anlrv,and nrf.LmJoat, D<r’j>yf:<>n(7t!^ iv ,,,About three, Lord EU'lr; came in with the -JdfeGuard?, on,d jgo^rt^f the .pri^cjiMti;horseback.

Lord George Murray ordered the iGiengary clan to go forward against these ; but, ,without writing for au engagement, they imme- ifdiately retreated. •The rear-guard consisted of Colonel Koy Stu- •art’s regiment of two hundred men, of the Gleu-gary clan, and a few companies which attendedthe ammunition wfl<>£on< : hut it ’’'as reinforced iin:on the present occasion by the Cameronsf Stew¬arts of Appin, and (’limy Macplierson’.s regiment. ,Lord George, proud of the post of honour which ttbe heTd, was the layt man in the line.

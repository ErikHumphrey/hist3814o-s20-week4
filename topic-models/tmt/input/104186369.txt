live one day of parting love !Eternity will not effaceThose records dear of transports past;Thy image at our last embrace,Ah ! little thought we ’twas our last!Ayr, gurgling, kissed his pebbled shore,O’erhung with wild woods, thick’ninggreenThe fragrant birch, and hawthorn hoar,Twined amorous round the raptured sceneThe flowers sprang wanton to be pressed,The birds sang love on every spray;Till too, too soon, the glowing westProclaimed the speed of winged day.Still o’er tAese scenes my memory wakes,And fondly broods with miser care ;Time but the impression stronger makes,As streams their channles deeper wear.>ly Mary, deat departed shade !Where is thy place of blissful rest ?Seest thou thy lover lowly laid ?llear’st thou the groans that rend his breast10The Banks o’

clearly !She aye shall bless that happy night,Amang the rigs o’ barley.1 hae been blythe wi’ comrades dear ;I hae been merry drinkin’;I hae been joyfu’ gatherin’ gear ;I hae been happy thinkin’;But a'

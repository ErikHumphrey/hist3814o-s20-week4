They took our bed,and made us fit by the fire all night: I put on a greatmany peats, and when the drovers were fail aiieep,I put on a big brafs pan full of water, and boiledtheir brogs therein for the fpace of half an hour,then lays them as they were, every pair ,by them-felves; fo when they rofe, every one began to chideanother, faying, “Hup nup, ye Hieing a brog:”for not one of them woulu ferve a child of ten yearsold, being fo boiled in; the landlord perfuaded themthat their feet was fwelled with the -hard travel¬ling, being fo wet the Lift night, and they would goon well enough if they had travelled a mile or two.Now the Highlandmen laught at,me the night be¬fore, when they lay down in the bed I was to have ;but I laught a-s much to fee them all three trot away,in the morning, with their boil’d brogs in theirhands.PART10 THE HISTORY OFPARTII.WE again came to aplace near Sutry-hill, where tthe ale was good, and v^ry civil ufage, and;ou. drought being very great, the more we drank,the better we lov'd it: and here we fell in companywith a quack-doctor, who bragged us with bottle a--bout for two days and two night, only when onefell drunk, we puflied and pricked him up with abig pin to keep him from fieeping: He bought ofoiir hair, and we of his pills and drugs, he havingas much knowledge of the one, as we had of the o-ther: only I was fure I had as much as would fet awhole parifh to the midden or mug all at once : butthe profit, thor all to come, went to the landlady tomake up the lofs of having the lime pifa’d off herboor-cheeks, and what we did not piffi, we feyth’dthrough our teeth, and gave the dogs the girt bits.But at laft our money ran fliort, and the landladyhad no chalk nor faith to credit us, feeing by ourcoats, courage, and condudl, that we would littlemind performance againft the day of payment: fothen we began to turn fober and wife behind thehand, and every one of us to feek fupplyfrom ano¬ther, and when we collected all the money we hadamong us, on the table, it was but fourpence half¬penny, which we lovingly divided amonglt uSj butonly three baubees a piece, and as drouthy Tom’sflock and mine was conjundl, we gave the quackagain his ffii—g ftuff'and {linking mugs and hegave us our goods and pickles of hair, which we e-qually divided betwixt us, the whole of it only cameto eighteen {hillings and fixpence prime colt, and fowe parted: I went for Eafl Lothian, and Tom forthe weft; but my forting of goods being very un-fuitable for that country, I got but little or no mo¬ney,JOHN CHEAP THE CHAPMAN, mney, which caufed me to apply to the goodman forto get lodging, and it being upon a Saturday’s nightwas hard to be found till very late in the night, Iprevailed to get flaying in a great farmer’s houfe,about two miles from Haddington ; they were all atfupper when I came in; I was ordered to fit downbehind their backs, the goodwife then took a difk,went round the fervants, and colledled a foup out ofevery cog, which was fufficient to have ferved threemen; the goodwife ordered me to be laid in the barnall night for my hed, but the bully-fac’d goodmanfwore he had too much fluff in it, to venture methere, the goodwife faid, I fhould not ly within thehoufe, for I would be o’er near the lades bed ; thenthe lads fwore 1 fnould not go with them, for I wasa forjelket-like fellow, and (wha kens whether I was■ honeft or not) he may fill his wallet wi’ our clothesand gang his wa’ or day-light. At lafl I was con-du&ed out to the fwine’s flye, to deep with an oldfow and feven pigs, and there I lay for two nights.Here, now I began to refle£l on the four fruits ofdrinking, and own all the mifery juft that was comeupon me.

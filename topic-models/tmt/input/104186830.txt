'Moll Flauders, &c.• ' 'i"1The most remarkable account tl^atI can give of my parents is, thatmy father was hanged tor felony, andmy mother transported forthe s^ne factafter she was delivered of me in New¬gate: from whence I was ulflen by some/4gypsies whom I remember, and left meat Colchester in Essex ; where the ma¬gistrates taking compassion on me, putme to a nurse; with whom I lived thir¬teen years, till such time as she died, andthen being fancied by a rich gentle¬woman for my nice needle-work, Ishared in the education of her daughtersin learning to dance, speak French, andplaying upon music, these qualifications,together with my beauty, caused mylady*s eldest son to pretend love to me,ana at last with his alluring speechesand powerful gold, feis melting biases*and affecyetiai* promises, that he wouldmarrv vs as soor 'as he ca it- : ' age,he prevailed upo,e to. sui f“fider myvirginity up to hitu, and to use mewhensoever he pleaseci ; but scarce ayear had expired before that his young¬est brother pretended love also ; in suchan open and honest u >nn;-r, n somuehthat all toe family coo: n tice ot it.How I should make a wife to him, andat the same time be a whore to theeldest brother, I could, not tell withoutbeing ruined ; as loving t :e former toextremity, being with c ild by him, butin short there happening such disputesbetween tne two brothers, k had like tohad driven me from toe family, but -the eldest brother consented I shouldmarry the youngest, as not caring tomarry me himself; behold ! 1 privatelywedded him, who, the first night hecame so drunk to my bed, that I easilypersuaded him he had done what hiseldest brother had done before him.In two years after he died, leavingme with two children, who v/eie takencare of by his parents, and having thena u lerabie good fortune in my ownhands, I married a ^Draper, who soonwas forced from me for debtintoFrance,which obliged me to take a lodging in6Mint, where, in a widow’s habit, Iteak upon me the name of Mrs Wan¬ders. Here I was courted as a mistressby several lewd men, but all these Iscorned, and it was my good fortune tomarry a gentleman whose estate was inVirginia, and whom I deceived by pre¬tending to him I was a greater fortunethan I really was. But indeed he7proved a very good hus band, and pri*vailed with me to go over * ith him intoVirginia, where 1 was kindly receivedby my husband’s mother. But here Ifound that our family xvas of the New¬gate train, she shew ng me where shawas burnt in the hand, bidding me notWonder ; for that mayor- was aneminent pick-pocket. Justice B——-rwas a shop-lifter, and 'ion W——rwho had so narrowly escaped the nub-bingpost, was there become an excellentdissenting teacher.Here I lived about three years with¬out having children, but not withoutan inward* remorse, as knowing mysecond husband was not dead. Andthis set me upon returning again intoEngland, teazing my spouse for thatpurpose, who wanted to know verymuch the true reason oi it. But I toldhis mother who came to pump me,that her story she had told me of hisbeing tiansported,'coijfirmed me in thebelief she was my mother, who wasdelivered of me in Newgate, and bywhich means she was saved from thegallows. This very much surpiisedher, but dreading the thoughts of hav¬ing another child by my husband, I was8forced to disclose the matter, to excusemy coldness to him in his embraces.tJpon hearing this, he fell into so deepa melancholy, that twice he attemptedto hsng himself, but was prevented ;and it was with very much difficultybefore I could obtain leave to return toEngland from him, which I did in themonth of August, after eight years con¬tinuance in that country, landing at.Milford Haven, in Wales, and in nineweeks arrived in London.Some time after I went to Bath, whenmaking my circumstances known, mylandlady lodged and boarded me at avery cheap rate, till the spring, when Iwas courted by a gentleman who had awife distempered in her head, and I re¬ceived seYeral presents from him, as ahundred guineas at one tin e, fifty at '1another, for taking care of him in an |illness. In short, I found him my bestfriend, taking several journies with him,till at length he got me with child, andWas delivered of a fine boy, going bythe name of Sir Walter Cleave’s ladyFrom Bath we returned to Hammer¬smith, near London. Six years I livedwith this gentleman, by whom I had9three children, till at length he fell sickin a house he had taken for his wifeand family «.c Bloomsbury. But uponhis recovery, I found that I was slight¬ed, no doubt through remorse of con¬science. Yet he sent me a letter witha bank-note of fifty pounds, promisinghe would take care cf my little boy, butwanting to get the other fifty poundsof him, I signed a general release whichput an end to this affair.But it was not long before it was fiftyfortune to get an acquaintance with aclerk belonging to the bank, whosewife having made him a cuckold bykeeping company with an officer of thearmy, and aner that with an apprenticebelonging to a draper. I had like tohive become his bride, promising onthat accouct to get a diverse from hisother wife.But whilst this was doing, goingdown into Lancashire, and being ima¬gined to be a fortune of fifteen thou¬sand pounds, I was married,to an Irishgentleman, by a Romish clergyman jbut he finding that I had no such effectsas I li<e a false woman had representedunto him, nor he any estate more tha^10what he had spent in his equipage incourting me.He therefore lent me as much moneyas would bear my charges up to Lon¬don, discharged me trom the marriage,left a letter for me upon the table, andwent away the next morning. Butafter he had discharged his servants hereturned at night to my joy, and ac¬companied me as far as to Dunstable,where we after wards parted after mutualinstruction had parted for our futurecourse of life.At London I lodged at an old mid¬wife’s, as being big with child, where(as I had given direction) a letter wassent to me from out of Lancashire ;which had been directed there by theclerk of the bank ; who told me thathe had obtained a decree against hiswife, and that he was at my service.To this I returned an immediate answerunder a cover, that I would be in townthe latter end of the year. And indeedafter having opened the matter to themidwife, and being delivered ot a braveboy, which, with much difficulty Iallowed her to dispose of, 1 went to11Stone in Lancashire, and so takingcoach, with a letter to my clerk to meetme at Brickhill; there in a short timehe prevailed with me to marry him.The next day from the window of theinn, I beheld my Lancashire husbandwith two others pass by ; when soonafter they were all three pursued ashighwaymen ; but returning safely withr.'.y husband to town, I lived with himexceeding happy for the space of fiveyears, by whom 1 had two children.Afterwards I rewarded my midwife forher fidelity to u e. But my husband’sclerk robbing him, it flung him intosuch a grief, that it immediately ended12his life; which entirely destroyed allmy happiness.Soon after this, being reduced to verygreat extre.nity, I was tempted to steala small bundle out of an apothecary’sshop, in Leadenhali-street, in which Ifound a suit of child-bed linen, fine lace,a silver mug and spoons, three shillings,and other matters. The next thingwhich I did, I inveigled a little childaway, from whom I took its gold neck¬lace, but though l had it in a privateplace, I would not kill or hurt it, andput it in the way home again. Ano¬ther time I took out of a shop, atStepney, two rings, one a diamond ring,and the other a plain one; and as Iwas once in Lombard-street, a thiefbeing pursued, dropped a piece of silk,which I made off with, and afterwardsdisposed of to a good advantage, andnot as thieves commonly do, for a song.Another time I stole a silver tankardout of an ale-house, which I afterwardssold to a pawn-broker, who greatlyencouraged me in such things. Sheshortly afterwards helped me to amistress, who made me more expert inthe thieving art; but not more form-\13nate; for first, she herself, with anotherof her scholars, were apprehended, ^|idcommitted to Newgate, for stealing twopieces of cambric from a linen-draperhi Cbeapside; both of them were con¬demned to die, but only our scholar wasexecuted ; for the other came off withwhat they call a circuit pardon fromthe judge.1 cannot but reflect upon one crimeI did, in taking from the hands of a gen¬tlewoman a bundle of plate when herhouse was on fire, and conveying it toiiiy own house, and so very fortunatewas I in escaping, that I became ex-ceeoing remarkable among the thieves jfor none was so great as Moll Flanders;but at length being threatened to .beimpeached by some in Newgate, I cloth¬ed myself in a man’s habit, though asmooth face (otherwise personal and tallenough) might soon have betrayed me.I kept company with another thief;who being discovered as he was stealingsome goods, was taken, and I happilyescaped, I had some time after this thehappiness of seeing him hanged.14My name was as well known at theOl^Baily, as a remarkable traitor is atthe secretary’s office. But being nowan excellent pick-pocket, as well as astrumpet, I took from a cull, after I hadmade him drunk, his gold watch, withhis sdk purse of gold, fine perriwig,sword and snuff-box ; and leaping outof the coach (which stood still to letanother coach pass by) I left my fool tomourn his disaster. This success mademe follow the whoring again, but find¬ing the profit of it too small to supportme, I returned again to my old tradeof shop-lifting.And one time as I was going alongthe street through Covent Garden, therewas a cry of stop thief stop thief; amercer’s shop having been robbed, and1 secured as the transgressor, and mosthaughtily insulted by the mercer andhis servants In a little time they gotthe right thief, who was much in thesame habit as mine. But for this affrontf prosecuted him at law, made the shop¬keeper come to an agreement, wherebyI got one hundred and fifty pounds ; sothat all this, with my other substance,might have maintained me, but I hav-15ing got an itch of thieving, could inno manner leave it off.I had an opportunity of commencinga coiner, but that was such a beggarlyand yet so dangerous a business, that Iwould never embarken in it. Nor couldI ever yet be bought into the societyof house-breakers. No person could bemore dexterous in stealing gold watchesthan I from the ladies’ side?, either atthe park, play-house, or at church. Iwas also very dextrous at gaming, andat one time cleared 73 guineas. Theuncommon success I had. made me gointo the country, where at Cambridge,Sturbridge fair, and at New Market, Iexpertly performed the same pranksover again ; and at Ips witch I robbed aDutchman of a portmanteau, by pre¬tending to be his wife in an inn, andin which was a very large quantity ofgold and silver.But afterwards coming up to Londonjand venturing boldly into a fine silver¬smith’s shop, while none were there, Iwas perceived by a shop-keeper overthe way ; but as I had a glance of him,16so I meddled with nothing, and a justiceof peace coming by, being called in,cleared me with flying colours.Another time, going into a semp¬stress’ shop in Cheapskie, and cheapen¬ing half a dozen of very good Hollandshifts, I doubted the length of them;upon which the sempstress slipt one ofthe smocks upon her, which gave methe advantage to pin it with two or threepins to her petticoat, and taking up therest, with other parcels of muslin, ruaaway out of the shop. The sempstressendeavouring then to pull off hersmock, pulled up her clouts, and run¬ning after, cryed, Stop thief, stop thief !with all she had exposed to the public ;who taking her for a mad woman, I gotelear off with my booty, and the semp¬stress was bantered to her dying day,besides losing to the value of fiftypounds of muslin.But after happening to steal somebrocaded silk fiom a mercer’s shop, Iwas apprehended, and being carriedbefore a justice, was committed to Now-gate, the place of my nativity, where it17is impossible for me to express the hor¬rors of a disconsolate mind.Htre the wretches triumphed overme. What! said they, is Mrs Flanderscome to Newgate ; what, Mrs Mary,and after plain Moll Flanders. But Iwas forced to content myself with thispiece of Newgate poetry.If I swing by this string,I shall hear the* bell ring.And there’s an end of poor Moll.Here I got into blessed acquaintance,whose company soon made me as hard¬ened as themselves; where to myamazement, I beheld among them myformer Lancashire husbaful, and whosemisfortunes he placed upon my account.Here n\y old tutoress had done whatshe conld for me to make up the matterwith my persecutors ; for she endea¬voured, the’ to no purpose, to hinderthe jury from finding the bill of indict¬ment against me. At the sessional hadpleaded not guilty, but was foundV* St. Sepulchre’s18guilty of felony, anti so received Sen¬tence of death accordingly.So concerned was ray poor govern¬ess, that having repented herself of allher sins, she sent me a minister also,who presented to me these four im¬portant truths, death, judgement, hea¬ven, and hell. When the dead-warrantcame down, he visited me as before ;the next day I heard the dismal toll ofSr. Sepulchre’s bell, and then was in-19armed of my reprieve, the unexpectedW made me immediately fall iato aerrible swoon.After this I was put on board in or-icr for transportation with several otherictims, as they called us, where we,ndured great hardships, as 'he first[kight lying upon the bare boards, but.fterwards were allowed the liberty oflittle cabins if vve had any clothes to layTO them. That night the ship fell downinto a place which they call Busty KoTe,from whence I sent a letter by the boat¬swain, who came on shore, to my go-20verness, and to cny poor Lancashirehusband. The next day my governessbrought me a sea-bed and a chest: inone drawer of which was my money ;and gave me an answer to that which Isent to my husband ; who hoped, |though he could not go with me in the jsame ship, yet to see me in Virginia,but by intercession, he was afterwardsput on board us, where my moneyfurnished us withgood accommodation.So we took likewise several materialswith us for the work of planting j andso we sailed fromthe Downs the 13thof April, and arrived safely on thecoast ot Virginia, where I soon perceivedmy own son, and my brother, his father,whom I had made my husband twentyyears ago ; but my mother had beendead some time before, having left aconsiderable plantation to me and myheirs.Many were the ways I pondered onto get from the sight ot my family inthose wretched circumstances j since Icould not bear the sight of my child,my brother, and husband,, who livednear that place 1 had taken for my set¬tlement ; and upon this very accountwre moved with all our effects intoMaryland, after a long and unpleasantvoyage, where we bought us two serv-vants, an English woman and a Negroman j then a piece of ground cf fifty-acres, and built a decent house thereon.And indeed our affairs went on veryprosperously, so that we looked uponone another with pleasure ; and then Iobtained my husband’s consent to goto Virginia ; and to discover myself tt>my brother. When I landed I wrote aletter to him, telling him of several par¬ticular affairs, which letter came intoi Jiis son’s hand, 'frho asking the messen-; ger where the gentlewomen was thatwrote it, he came to me, which was: about seven miles off, attended by twoi servants on horseback, and coming toij me, kissed me, saying, Dear mother are; you alive ? and then he fell to weeping.He told me that his father was quitesuperanuated,and beside himself, whicht made him conceal the letter from him,»that the plantation which my motheri h*d left rne was in hvs possession ; Cofor the produce of it he gave a hundredpounds, engaging to be my trustee and; faithful steward. Indeed, in all his22actions he proved a most dutiful child,allotting servants to wait upon me, andtreating n e with as great splendor asif I had been a sovereign princess. Ipresented him with a gold watch, andtaking my leave of him, after I hadacquainted him that I intended to marry |a gentleman who came over with me.I set sail inasloop my son had provided,and cams safe to my own plantationsagain, bringing over with me threefine horses vith curious harness andsaddles, some hogs, two cows, and agreat many other things.When I had related all this verygood fortune to my husband, he liftedup his hands in an extacy of joy, andgave thanks to heaven for this suddenand so happy a change. Soon afterthis, arrived a cargo from England,which my governess had sent mewith three women servants, whicfcmade my husband amazed, especialljwhen 1 assured him that they wenpaid for. How, says he, was I deceived when I married a wife in Lancashire1 think I married a fortune and a gcocfortune too.23I had taken care to buy those thingsfor my husband which I knew he toaka delight to wear ; as two good longwig^, two silver hiked swords, three orfour side fowling pieces, a line saddlewith holsters and pistils very handsome,with a scarlet cloak ; and in one word,every thing I could think on thatmight possibly oblige him, and to makehim appear, as he really was, a veryfine gentleman. I must not omit in¬forming my readers, that one of thewenches my governess had sent us hap¬pened to come double, having been gotwith child by one of the seamen in theship, as she owned afterwards, beforethe ship got as far as Gravesend ; soshe brought us a fine boy about sevenmonths after her landing.After my brother’s, or former hus¬band’s death, my son visited us, wheremy dear husband made him most ex¬ceeding welcome; and truly no personcould be blessed with a more dutifulchild. In this happy manner we livedfor the space of 20 years, resolving tospend the remainder of our days in asincere penitence for the wicked liveswe had lived. And thus we shall do24by our extensive charity and liberaihospitality to all men.Thus far have we given an account ofMoil Flanders, taken from her ownmemorandums, to which we shall add,that we have an account from Virginia,that she died lately, having preparedfor that change with the greatest piety,and devotion. And as she perceivedher di&solution to draw near, she be¬queathed several legacies for charitable Iuses ; and dying, her funeral was per¬formed with great solemnity, being in¬terred in St Mary’s church in Virginia.FINIS,

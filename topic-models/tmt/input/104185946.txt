Laird o’ Cockpen he’s proud an’ he’s great,His mind is ta’en up wi’ the things o’ the state,lie wanted a wife his braw house to keep.But favour wi’ wooin’ was fashions to seek.Douu bj the dyke-side a lady did dwell;At his table-head he ihodit she’d look well;M'Clish’s ae dochter o’ -Claverseha’ Lee ;A pennyless lass wi’ a lang pedigree.His wig was weel-powder’d, as guid as when new,His waistcoat was white, his coat it was blue,He put on a ring, a sword and cock’d hat,And wha could refuse the Laird wi’ a’ that.Jf fLHe took the grey mare, and rade cannily.An’ rapped at the yett o’ Claverseha’ Lee,Gae tell Mistress Jean to come speedily ben.She’s wanted to speak to the Laird o’ Cockpen.Mistress Jean was making the Okler-flower wine,—And what brings the Laird at sic a like time.She put aff her apron, an’ ou her silk gown.Her mutch wi’ red ribbons, and ran awa down.An* wheu she came down, she bowed fit’ low.An’ what was his errand he soon let her know.Amaz’d was the Laird when the lady said—na ;And wi’ a laigh courtesy she turn’d awa.Dumfounder’d he was—he nae sigh did gie ;He mounted his marc and rade cannily ;An’ aften he thocht as he gaed through the glen.She’s daft to refuse the Laird o’ Cockpen.Near to the house amang the lang trees.There he did meet sweet Jeanie Greenlees;At his table she sits like a white-tappit hen.And mickle thinks she o the Laird o’ Cockpen.THE LASS OF ARRANTEEN1E.Far lone amang the Highland hills,’Midst Nature’s wildest grandeur.By rocky dens and woody glensWith, weary steps I wander.The langsome way, the darksome day.The mountain mist sae rainy,Are nought to me, when gaun to thee—Sweet lass of Arranteenie.4Yon mossy rose-bud down the howe,Just op’ning fresh and bonnie,Blinks sweetly ’neath the hazel bough,And’s scarcely seen by ony.Sae sweet amidst her native hills.Obscurely blooms my Jeanie,Mair fair and gay than rosy May—The flower of Arranteenie.Now from the mountain’s lofty browI view the distant ocean,There av’rice guides the bounding prow,Ambition courts promotion.Let fortune pour her golden store,Her laurel’d favours many,Give me but this, my soul’s first wish,The lass of Arranteeuie.MIRREN GIBB’S PUBLIC HOUSE.Last Monday night at sax o’clock,To Mirren Gibb’s I went, man,To meet wi’ some auld cronies there.It was my hale intent, man.So down wo sat and pried the yill,Syne I pu’d out my sneeshin' mill,An’ took a pinch wi’ right good-will,O’ beggar’s brown, the best in town,Then sent it rouiT about the room.To gie ilka aue a scent, man.The sneeshin’ mill—the cap gaed round.The joke, the crack an’ a’, man,’Bout markets, trade, and politics,To wear the time awa, man.Ye never saw a blither setO’ queer auld-fashion’d bodies met.For fient a grain o’ pride nor pet,Nor eating care got footing there ;But friendship rare, aye found sincere.And hearts without a flaw, man.To cringing courtiers kings may blawHow rich they are and great, man.But we outstrip their kingships farWi’ a’ their regal state, man.For Lucky’s swats sae brisk and fell.An’ T ’s snuff sae sharp and snell,Garr’d ilk ane quite forget himsel’;Made young the auld, inflam’d the canid.And fir’d the saul with projects bauld.That dar’d the power o’ fate, man.But what are a’ sic mighty schemesWhen ance the spell is broke, man,A set o’ maut- inspired whimsThat end in perfect smoke, man.An what like some disaster keenCan chase the glamour frae our een.And bring us to oursel’s again ;As was the fate o’ this auld pate.When that night late I took the gateAs crouse as ony cock, man.6For sad misluck, without my hat,I doitiug cam’ awa, man ;An’ when I down the Dry gate cam.The win’ began to blaw, man.When I cam to the Drygate Brig,It whipt awa my good brown wig.That whirl’d like ony whirligig,As up it flew out o’ my view.While I stood glowring, waefn* blue,Wi* wide-extended jaw, man.When I began to grape for’t syne,Thrang poutering wi’ my staff, man,I coupet owre a mucklo stane,And skail’d my pickle snuff, man.My staff out o’ my hand did jump,And hit my snout a dreadfu’ thump,Which rais’d a most confoundet lump ;But whaur it flew I never knew.Yet sair I rue the mark sae blue.It looks sae fleesome wauf, man.Now wad ye profit by my loss,Then tak’ advice frae me, man,And ne’er let common sense tak’ wingOn fumes o’ barley bree, man.For drink can heeze a man sae high,As gar his head maist touch the sky.But down he tumbles by and bye,Wi’ sic a thud ’mang stanes and mud,That aft it’s good if dirt and bloodBe a’ he has to dree, man.7JACK S THE LAD.Our ship’s a-port, so here I be,With heart as light as cork, d’ye see ;’Don

George Street.BLAE BERRIES.Will you go to the highlands jewel with me.Will you go to the high hills the flocks tsfee,It is health for my jewel to breathe the fweet air.And to pull the blaeberries in the forefl: fo fair.To the highlands my jewel I will not go with thee.For the road it is long and the hills they are high,1 do love thefe low vallies and fweet corn fields.More than all your blaeberries your wild mountainsyield.(3)Our hills they arebloom,t would cheer a fine fancy in the month of J une,Co pull the blaeberries and carry them home,ind let them on your table when December comeson.1 Out fpake her father that fancy old man,if on might have chofen a miflrefs among your ownclan,.is but poor entertainment for our lowland dames,ijfo promife them berries on wild heather bleems.If I had chofen a miflrefs among my own clan,jj would never have afked a word of your daughtergood man,:'\s for her entertainment I tell you no lie,rihe fhall juft fhare as I do if fhe go with me.Kilt up your green plaidie, walk over yon hill,For a light of your highland face does me much ill,For I will wed my daughter and fpare pennies too,to whom my heart pleafej and what’s that to you.My plaid it is broad, it has colours anew,jood man for your kindnefs I’ll leave it with you,have got a warm cordial keeps a’ cold from me.The blithe blinks of love from your daughter’s eye.My flocks they are thin, and my lodging but bare,Vnd you that has meikle the more you can fpare.bonny when the heather’s in.(4)Some of your fpare pennies with us you will flnre*And you winna fend your laflie o’er the hills bare.He went to his daughter to give her advice.Said if you go with him I am fure you’re not wife.He is a rude highland fellow as poor as the crow.He’s of the clan of the Catherines for ought that Iknow.But if you go with him I’m fure you’s go bare.You fhall have nothing that father or mother can• fpare,Of all I poflefs I’ll deprive you for ay.If o’er the hills laffie you do go away.It’s father keep what you’re not willing to give.For I will go with him as fure as I live,What fignifies gold or treafure to me.When the highland hills are between my love and me.Now Ihe has gone with him in fpite of them a’Away to a place that her eyes never faw.He had no fteed to carry her home,But ft ill he faid laflie think not the road long.In a warm fummer’s evening they came to a glen.Being wearied with travel the laflie fat down.Get np my brave laflie let us ftep on.For the fun will go round before we win home.My feet are all torn, my fhoes are all rent,I am wearied with travel juft like to faint.Were it not for the fake of your kind company,I would lie in this defart until that I die.The day is far fpent, and the night coming on.Then ftep you afide to yon bonny mill town,And there you afk lodging for thee and for me.For glad would I be in a barn to be.The place it is bonny and pleafant indeed.But the people’s hard harted to us that’s in need-Perhaps they will not grant us barn nor byre,But I ftiall go and aik them as it’s your delire.The laffie went formoft, fure I was to blame.To alk for a lodging myfelf I thought Ihame,The laffie replied with tears not a few,It’s ill ale faid the laffie that’s four when it’s new,A fweet chryftal river near by to a grove.His flocks they were feeding- in numberlefs dioves ;Allan flood muling his flocks for to fee,Come away my brave Allan it’s no pleafure to me.A beautiful laddie with green tartan treufe.And two bonny laffies were bughting in ewes.They faid honoured rnafter are you come again.For long have we been thinking for you cominghome.Bught m your ewes laffies and go your way home,’ brought a fwain from the fouth I ha\ e her to tame,der father is fallen and where can ilie fly,fhe bell bed in all the houfe there lhali ftie lie.The laffie’s heart’s fallen till it winna rife,Fill many brave lad and lafs came in with a phrafe,Fo welcome the lady, to welcome her home,iuch a hall in the highlands fhe never thought on.The laddies did whiftle and the laffies did fmg,Fhey made her a fupper might have ferved a queen,tVith ale and good whifky they drank her healthround,''end they made to the laffiie a

fummer’?day.O Allan, O Allan, I am indebted to thee,rt is a debt Allan I can never repay,X Allan, O Allan, how came you for me,iure I am not worthy your bride for to be.How call you me Allan, when Sandy’s my name,vVhy call you me Allan, fure you are to blame.for don’t you remember when at fchool with thee.-I was hated by all the reft loved by thee.flow oft have I fed on your bread and your cheefe^Likewife when you had but a handful of peafe,Your cruel harted father hound at me his dogs.They tore all my bare heels and riv’d all my rags.If this be you Sandy how happy am I,If this be you Sandy I am glad you to fee.When all the reft went to bed deep was frae me.For thinking on you Sandy what was become of thee.My parents were born Idbg before me,1 Perhaps by this time they are drown’d in the fea,p Thefe lands a poffeffions they left them to me,i And I came for you jewel to {hare them with thee.In love we began and in love we will end,SAnd a voyage to your father once more we will

ye’ll grow fairYe‘re sair fash’d hauding naething togetherYe’re no fed on deaf nutsYe’re busy seeking the thing that’s no tintYe’re like the hens ye rin aye to the heapYe’re fear’d for the day ye never sawYe‘re best when ye're sleepingYe’re a sweet nut if ye were well crackedYe're no light where ye lean a’Ye're come aff the house of HarletilhimYe soon weary o’ well doingYe’s get your brose out of the lee side of the potYe shape shoon by your ain shachled feetYour tongue's nae slanderYour tongue rins aye before your witYe watna where a blessing may lightYe was never born at that time of the yearYoung folk may die, but auld folk maun theYoung ducks may be auld geeseYour meal’s a’ deaghYour head will never fit your father’s bonnetY’our thrift’s as good as the profit of a yell heaYour wame thinks your wysen's cuttedY’our purse was steeked when that was paid forY’our gear will never o’er gang youYour minny’s milk is no out of your nose yetFINIS.

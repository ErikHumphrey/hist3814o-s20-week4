rT»EHISTORYOFJOHN MPHERSON,Dich Balf,ANDGILDER ROY,THREE NOTORIOUS ROBBERS.EDINBURGH:PRINTBD FOR THE BOOKSELLERS.' %THELIFEOFJohn MacPherson.A NOTORIUS ROBBER.XT could never be learned with certaiu-Aty where John Macpherson was born ;his parents were not so poor bat theywere able to leave iiim a pretty little in¬come at their death, rie was then about19 years of age when their effects cameinto his hands, which ha made a shift tospend, in the company of pert womenand gamesters, in tesp than three years,during which time he was always a lead¬ing man at hurlmgs, patrons and match¬es of foot-ball, and acquired such fameby his wondrous activity, that no singleperson dared to oppose him at any exer¬cise. He was accounted in his time thestrongest man in the nation; he couldhold an hundred weight at arm’s length,in one hand, and would make little or no-f4thing of twisting a new horse shoe roundl.ke a gad; yet notwithstanding all hisa tivity he was soon reduced to poverty,and so, from one step after another,brought to the gallows. Want of pre¬caution ami care in the beginning, oftenlays men under difficulties they can ne¬ver surmount, and men that are bred upin luxury and idleness, seldom settlethemselves rightly to business after. No¬thing is more commendable in youth thanindustry, it is the bulwark and preserva¬tion of the commonwealth, and the sup¬port of private persons and families.When vice has settled in the bone, nomedicine that can be applied to the fleshcan expel it. Of this kind^we h^ve anexample before us. This John Macpher-son, when he had sold his little income,and spent what he had, was under thenecessity of seeking for a livelihood some¬how or other. He was a stranger towork, and it was beneath him to beg,neither could he brook to rely on thecourtesy of his friends, who (as it usual¬ly falls out in such cases) began to lookvery shy upon him./ Upon this be began to think of a newway of living, and having provided him-5self with some weapons, a very goodstaff, he betook himself to the high road,far enough from his native place not tobe known. In his first attempt, when hecame up with any one that he knew hadmoney, he first requested of them to lendhim some, and if by terror or persuasionhe could prevail on them so to do, hewould be pretty moderate, and common-ly took but pail; but upon resistance hemade little or nothing of taking a manby the arm, and pulling him offhis horse,he then usually would give him a prettyhearty squeeze, which seldom failed tobring him into compliance, and to deli¬ver without further trouble; yet if a manstill continuei'sturdy, his custom was tothrow him over his shoulder, and run a-way with him to some private place, andthere rifle him, what became of his hor seit mattered not.This was the common and usual wayof robbing, which he continued for ma¬ny years, very seldom with company, butmostly alone. One evening he went in¬to a country house by himself and whenhe had carried all the people he met inhis way into another room, and fastenedthe door, he began to put his plunder in0order for carrying it off; meanwhile someworkmen, that were employed abovestairs, ca.ne down and set the rdst loose,who ail fell upon him together, with clubsand other instruments, till he was almostoverpowered ; at last he got hold of thewoman of the house, whom he cast overhis shoulder, to screen himself frcm theblows, (knowing very well they wouldnot strike for tear of hurting her,) ardran away with ner into a little wood justbefore the house, where he laid her downand clapped his fjct upon her petticoatsto prevent her from stirring, while therest stood at some distance holding a par¬ley, and threaten g /or they were afraidto Jo any more, but it was all to no pur¬pose, he parleyed them out of twentypieces of gold hefo;e he quitted her, andthen left t <eir coasts. This method oftaking up the wecmen, when he was hard,set, he always practised after, and it stillanswered Ins ends; and the^e are twoexamples of his common way of robbing.He was never known to murder any bo.dy ; nay, he was very cautious of srikingunless in his own defence. However,he was at last taken by treachery, and at-ter being tried and found guilty, wasdis-patched by the common finisher of theInw, about the year I678. As he wascarried to the gallows, he played a finetune of his own composing on the bag¬pipe, which retains the name of Mac-*Pherson’s tune to this day.ITHE LIFEOFRICHARD HALF,A CRUEL MURDERER AND HIGHWAYMAN,rTHE reputed father of Richard Balf■^was a pedlar, though but of small ac¬count, who with his wife used to travelto fairs and markets up and down thecountry, on pretence of getting bread,but, as the story goes, they got more bybegging and cheating, than by fair deal¬ing $ and at length, by thieving, a#d rob¬bing, made a shift of obtaining a hem.pen necklace, which eased them of alltheir care, and was administered to themby their son Dick, for robbing and mur¬dering in the manner following. Hav-8ing cast their eyes upon a lone house inthe country, wherein it was reported theowner kept a considerable sum of money,they had an itching to be at it j and ac¬cordingly one night, having laid theirscheme, (with their son Dick, not abovefifteen years of age, and one mere whowas to assist them,) they entered thehouse by some stratagem, and the fami¬ly being fast asleep, they thought it thesafest way to dispatch them ; so begin-ing with the servant maids, they cutboth their throats with a knife, then go¬ing to the servant man, served him inthe same way, and also three children,who lay in a room adjoining ; lastly, pro¬ceeded to the apartment where the mas¬ter and mistress lay; and consultingwhat method to take for that purpose,it was resolved to put the man to thetorture, but his answer not satisfying therobbers, ihey dispatched them both, andfell to plundering the house. Whenthey gathered together all the booty theycould in the house, they marched ofi‘,but as it commonly happens, that mur¬der is found out by one means or other,so this was happily discovered by the' ;\.r-9murderers disagreeing among themselvesabout dividing the spoil.Dick and his parents were ah takenup and put into prison, tried and con¬victed of murder, but so it fell out, thatthe Judge, taking compassion of the boy’syouth, and no hangman to be had, thatthe son was the granted his pardon onacount of executing his father and moth¬er. It was Dick’s comfort, when theycame to the gallows, to hear them say,before all the good company, “that theyhad rathe** be hanged by their son thanany body else; because they made nodoubt but he would use them as kindlyas he expected shortly to he used him¬self which being the dying words ofhis parents, made him very careful of ty¬ing the ends of the ropa fast, to dispatchthem more speedily and surely.Dick having seen the exit of his par¬ents, was very much discouraged for agood while, from following their prac¬tices, and proposed going to service foran honest livelihood, but nobody beingwilling to receive him on account oftheir exaltation ; and time nav ng wornout the good impressions t!iat were madeon his mind on that occasion, “ what was10bred in the bone beyan to appear oncemore in the so he betook himselfto picking pockets, till being so oftenin a chair, and ducked in a horse pond,(which was a sort of punishment thenused for several kinds of petty larceny,)that he grew tired of that callling, andinlisted himself into a gang of Satyrs,who make it their business to steal allktnds of cattle that came in their way.It would be surpricing to hear of ail themethods these Satyrs have of conveyingcattle away in the night. But however,this trade was attended with so muchtrouble, and not answering his end, thatBalf soon grew tired of it, and becamea Cygaret, whose business is to cut offthe skirts of a coat, gown, or pocket, orany other part of a garment that hangsloose, when people are at their devotionin any public assembly; which not an¬swering neither, he entered himself intoa gang' of Grmnets, who, either by scal¬ing walls with rope ladders, or c.eepingin at holes and windows, in the night,rob houses privately. It happened onenight, that Dick being on^aii exploit ofthis kind, he found a considerable bootyof plate and other valuable things, worth11at least £\50. which he let fall into ablanket held 'oy liis comrades at the bot¬tom of the window to receive the plun¬der. He had but two comrades, theybeing brothers, seeing so valuab' a nrizein small bulk, concluded to keep )t tothemselves, and leave Hick to take care .of himself, and accorgingly, taki' g awaythe rope ladder, the; made off wn : theprey, and left Bah t>; come down as hecould. Balf then seeing hinv elt outwit¬ted, could not tel! hat to do, till observ¬ing tiiere wcas a bedstead in the room butnewly corded, he cut the cord with aslittle noise as possible, and fastening oneend of it in the room, he let himself downinto the street. He was no sooner onhis feet but he began to meditate revenge,and immediately posted away to theirplace of rendezvous, te.'ling his comradesthey were all discovered, ami the people‘Win m they had robbed were in pm suitot fbem, just at his hee^. Before thew r s were well out of his mouth, theythey van away helter-skelter, and left alltht booty, hot!’money and piate, behindthem ; but DIck had the wit to stav andsecure it tor his own use, and would jie.12ver give any part of it to his comradesafter.When he had got so much insight andexperience in this business as to makehimself a complete master, he goes nextinto a crew of wool combers, whose bus¬iness is to snatch hats, cloaks, wigs, andwomen’s handkerchiefs, &c. off in theinght; but at length being taken in thefact at Galway,, by a gentleman who pur¬sued him, and overtook him wi{,h a drawnsword in his hand ; he was committed togaol, and burned in the hand for thesame offence.This business not answering his pur¬pose, he took up a resolution to com¬mence highway robber. Being a littleat a icss for a good nag to mount him¬self or, he contrives to get one in thismanner: he observed there was a neigh¬bour of his landlord’s in Galwey, thathad a very well bred gelding of a goodsize, very fit for the purpose, and thatthere were no obstacle to hinder him butthe stable door, which was ^tili kep lock¬ed ; to remove this difficulty, he went toan old comrade of his, whom he knew tohe an expert pick-lock, and agreed withhim to open the stable door the nextJ3night at an hour fixed. A heavv showerof rain favoured Balf’s design; he car¬ried with him four old stockings, andput a little hay into the feet of them,drew them on the horse, and led him,saddled and bndied, through the gate-Way, without making any noise. Assoon as he had got the horse into thestreet, (without staying to take off thestockings, which he thought would soonwear off with riding, in which he guess¬ed right,) he mounted, and made off,without taking leave of any body, hav¬ing taken care to provide himself withi good case of pistols and a sword beforeland, but never thought proper to en¬quire what time the owner missed hishorse, or what search he made after it.Thus accoutred, and well mounted ona good nag, ne rode all night till he cameto the house of one of his acquaintancesntar Athlone, where he lay concealedwith his horse till the next day, resolvingno; to make his public appearance tillhe got a good distance from Galway.He then moved to the north, and be¬gan his new trade of “Stand and deli¬ver,” as usual with men of his rank, andhad such wonderful success in his enter-prises in robbing passengers on the road,that above fiifty travellers had been com*pelled to deliver him their purses of con-siderable value, in six months time, whichmade the people so timorous, that theycarried no money about them except tra¬velling charges; by which means Ditfkoften met with disappointments, whichenraged him to that degree, that in re.venge, as he called it, he neither sparedman, woman, nor child that fell in hisway.Such disappointments made him thinkit necessary to change his quarters for twhile, and accordingly, having fixed hisplaces of rendezvous, he scoars t’le otherthree provinces with the like success, ardthought the whole of the nation scarcelylarge enough to furnish him witn occa¬sions ; and like death, never took any de¬nial till he was satisfied.One day, as he was hunting in qu2Stof his game, he met earl of D—1 betweenBailyshannon. and Sligo, passing in biscoach, and having s iprised and made hisservants prisoners, he road up to the earl,expecting a large booty, but finding hehad no more than 150 guineas about him,Balf was very much dissatisfied at it, and15ordered him to draw a bill of L.60 on acertain goldsmith in Dublin, toransomhiscoach horses from being killed. As soonas Dick received the bill, (leaving theservants tied,) he cut the harness, andmade what speed he canid to Dublin,wifere he received value for the notewithout being apprehended.He was so notorious for robbing onthe mount ot ^arnsmore, that a guard¬house was built, by order of the govern'ment, in the middle of it, to secure pass¬engers from being robbed by him, whichwas continually supplied with a companyof soldiers, either from Londonderry,Colraine, or Belfast.This being Balf’s head quarters at thattime, he was obliged to shift j so mov¬ing towards Lorras he finds new quar¬ters; where one day metting with Gen.In—y, though he had several attendantswaiting on him, Dick resolutely rode upto him, and commanded him to standand deliver; but the General refusing toobey his order, a sharp engagement be¬gan between them. The General drewout a pistol, but before lie could makeit ready, his horse was shot under him,the pistol in his hand went offin the fall,16*witkout doing any harm, and Ball tookcare to secure the other. The groomwas the first that came to assist his mas¬ter, who seeing him in such danger, wentup resolutely, thinking to seize Dick, andhold him until his fellow servant came upto his assistance, but he had the mis^r-tune tw be shot dead on the spot in ma¬king the attempt. The general seeingnis horse and man both dead, and Balt-continue his resolution to conqueror die,consented to let him take 80 guineas, a* diamond ring, and a gold watch, withwhich he rode off, and left the Generalto ride the groom’s horse.' Not for this action alone, but severalfull*as bold and daring, Balf by,this timewas become so notorious, that a rewardof L 500 from the government, by procla¬mation. was offered for the taking of him.This encouraged several people to jointhemselves in parties to go in quest ofhim ; but he being timely informed of it,employed some spies whom he kept infee, to give him notice beforehand oftheir coining out. Accordingly, onemorning, as he sat by the fire in one ofhis houses of rendezvous, he had noticethat nine men were in pursuit of him.17and that they were very near him, inten*ding to search that house. Balf notknowing which road was safest to take,was resolved to stand once more andfight for his life, but not without havingrecourse to some stratagem. Then hav¬ing exchanged coats with the man of thehotise, who was his confident, he order¬ed him to go out of a back window, andhide himself in a barn behind the house,lust as the men came before the door.The fellow acted his part so well, thatthey saw hirn go through the window,and likewise in at the barn door, wherehe took care to hide himself effectuallyby going under some straw, where therewas a communication made between the'house and the barn. In the mean whileDick was so well fixed in his fortifica¬tions, that he might have shot ten menwithout receiving any harm.When the pursuers saw the man. whomthev took for Balf, enter the barn, theywent directly to it, setting a guard at thedoor, whilst the rest examined the out¬side for fear he should escape out at anywindow or private hole, but finding nosuch place, they all came to the door, re¬solved on a thorough search. When18they had searched a long time to no pur¬pose, they began to move a great heapof straw from one end of the barn to theother, big with hopes of finding whatthey came for, leaving only two to watchthe door. While they were thus employ¬ed, Balf comes unawares, in disguise, u-pon the centinels, first discharged a pieceon them, and then irawing his sword ;widen terrified them so much, that theyfled to the further side of the barn forfear, while he shut the door upon them,and fastened it so secure, that it was im-possible for them to get out without help,and when he had done, set fire to thebarn, mounted his horse, and away, andbid them get out as well as they could.After this he began to be more and moreafraid of staying in his own country; sofleeing to Donaghadee, a see-port townin the north of Ireland, he took shipping,and landed at Port-Patrick in Scotland;where meeting with an handsome agree¬able lady, he picked up an acquaintancewith her, which gave occasion to her hus¬band to be jealous : who, in revenge, un-derstandihg well enough what he was,caused him to be seized and sent over toIreland again. He was brought pinion-19ed through all the County of Dublin#and committed there to Newgate, andshortly after, was tried and condemned.While he was under sentence of condem.nation, he offered 50001. to save his life,but the government would not be bribedto a save a rogue from the gallows, so hewas ordered to die, and accordingly hang¬ed he was at Dublin, on Friday the 20thof May, 1706, aged 29 years, and thenhung in chains, on the mount of Barns-moor in Ulster.Jack Balf and his brother (of the saidfamily,) were born some miles from Dun-laven, on the mountains of Wicklow.Jeck was put an appreutice to a stocking-weaver, but was never once suspected ofmisbehaviour till after his brother’s sus¬pension on the three-legged at Stephen’sgreen ; soon after which he made an al-terarion in his business, and turned a sur¬veyor of the high mads, without license,and as he had been bred on the moun¬tains, lie first chose Tallo w road, as it laynext to his inaccessible lurking places inthat country, where he committed such■b number of robberies as put all the na¬tion in dread of him. He was at lengthapprehended near Dublin, and executed, 20at Stephen’s Green, where his brotherwas exalted to that high station a shorttime before.Bait’s dwelling house remains to thisday on the side of the mountain nearBallimore ; it contains two rooms, and issituated in a shrubbery, on the side of ahill, evironed with rocks, which makes *it difficult of access, even to those thatknow it, and being thatched with heathunder cover cf trees, is not to be seen atany distance, though one may see fromthence the whole country on all sides.THE LIFE .OFGILDER ROY,MUBDERER, RAVISHER, INCENDIARY, ANDHIGHWAYMAN.^pHIS villain was descended from an^ ancient family, and born in Perth¬shire, in the jiighlands of Scotland. Hisfather d)ing just as lie came of age, lefthim eighty im rks a-year, which he squan¬dered away in less than a year and a half,and then lived upon his mother who sup-21plied him with several sums of money ftill finding no hopes of reclaiming him,she withheld her hand ; he thereforeburst one night into her bed chamber,and cut her throat from ear to ear, ra¬vished his own sister and the maid, androbbing the house, set it on fire, andburnt them both in it.1 his unparalleled piece of villainy soonmade a noise over ail the kingdom, anda proclamation was Issued, promising ahundred .pounds reward to take him deador alive, which made him fly into France,where he picked Cardinal Richelieu'spocket, as he was saying mass at St Din*ms’s church in Paris; which the Kingperceiving, Gilder Roy made motions tohim not to take any notice, and shouldsee good sport, upon which the king lethim alone: and after prayers, going tothe cardinal, he asked him if he had anymoney about him ?—who missing hispurse, fell into a great surprise j but theking, knowing which way it went, fell alaughing, till being tired with laughter,he was willing the cardinal should knowwhat was become of it, that he mighthave it again, thinking the thief to be anhonest man j but upon looking *ouud for22 !him, could not find him, Gilder Roy ha¬ving slipped away unperceived. Thisturned ail the laughter against the king,which made him his conHderate.Gilder Roy next proceeded to Spain,and went, upon a day of public enter*tainment, to the duke of Medina Cseli’shouse where seeing a trunk oitplate readyfor the servants to attend their lord with ;he dressed himself in a Spanish habit likethe steward of the house, and desiringthe servants to sit off the trunk, carriedit away.By this time thinking that all the noisfewas over about him in his own country,Gilder Roy resolved to go to Scotland a-gain, where he soon become as notori¬ous a highwayman as ever was in thecountry before. He robbed the Earl ofLinlithgow-of a gold watch, a diamondring, and eighty guineas. He at lengthbecame so terrible that people were a- ;fraid to travel. When he wanted mon- ,ey, he would go into the north and driveaway the cattle, unless the inhabitantspaid him contribution, which most ofthem did quarterly.One time meeting with Oliver Crom¬well and two servants on the road to23Glasgow, he bade him stand and deliver;but after the discharge of some pistols.Gilder Roy made off, and they pursued}ym j finding they gained upon him, heturned short about, and shot Oliver’shorse, which in falling broke his leg: hethen shot one of his servants, and gavethe other quarter; finding Oliver lame,he tied their legs under an ass’s belly,and sent them to seek their fortune.Three of his competoions being takenand sent to Glasgow Jail, were orderedto be hanged in chains: which GilderRoy resenting, he vowed revenge onetime or other, and a little time aftefcmeeting the Judge upon the road to A*berdeen, he stripped his coachman andI two footmen, tied them neck and heels,and threw them into a pond : he thenrobbed the Judge, and carded him tothe tree where his companions hang(which in Scotland is like a turnstiejfhung him upon the fourth beam, saying,1 By my saul, mon, as this structure iserected to break people’s craigs, and ianot uniform without another, I must e’¬en hang you upon the vacant beam.At length his villanies grew sc intol¬erable, that he gloried not only in rob*bing, but in murdering men, ravishing-women, and burning houses.But at length a proclamation! comingout, promising a reward of a thousar^lmerks to take him dead or alive, one PegCunningham, a strumpet, with whom hakept company, betrayed him. Findinghimself surrounded with fifty men, heran into her bed-chamber, and ripped up jthe h'vrloFs belly; he then killed eight ‘of his adversaries, before they could take ||him ; but at last being overcome, he was |taken and carried to Edinburgh Castle, |[where he was kept in irons three days |iwithout victuals or drink, and then hang- |ed without any process, on a gibbet, thir¬ty feet high, and afterwards hung inin chains on another forty feet high, inthe thirty-fourth year of his age. •!FINIS.

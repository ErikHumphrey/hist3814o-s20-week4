On hiscoming to Bostra, a city on the confines of thatcountry, while he was attending his uncle’s factorsin the vending of his wares in the public market¬place, he was there seen, (say the Mahometans,')5iIby Bahira, a learned monk of that place, whoimmediately knowing him to be the great Prophetthat was to come, pressed with great earnestness{ through the crowd unto him, and taking him by[ the hand, there foretold of him all these greati, things which afterwards came to pass,i The mark whereby he knew him (say they) wasi.the prophetic light which shone on his face. This/prophetic light, they tell us, God first placed on! Adam, to be a sign of the prophets that were to be(born of him ; that this light, descending down toI Abraham, was from him divided into two ; one onIthe face of Isaac, and the other on the face offlshmael: that Isaac’s light was soon manifested inthe many prophets which appeared of his posterity'among the children of Israel: but that which was((placed on Ishmael was suppressed, and lay hid till(the coming of Mahomet, on whom it first appeared;iand that Bahira seeing it on him, thereby knewhim, (say they,) to be a great prophet sent of God,who was ero long to manifest himself. But othersi say, the mark by which he knew him was the seal)f his prophetic mission, stamped with a wonderfulmpression between his shoulders. But the truths, Mahomet did not become acquainted with thisBahira, till many years after, when he traded forDadigha in those parts, as will hereafter appear.Till the 2oth year of his age, he continued inhis employment under his uncle ; but thqn, one ofhe chief men of the city dying, and his widow,Svhose name was Cauigha, (to whom he left all hisock, which was of considerable value) wanted a,ctor to manage it for her, she invited Mahometito her service ; and having offered him suchIvantageous conditions as he thought fit to accept\ he undertook this employment under her, and6for three years traded for her at Damascus, andother places ; anil ih the management of thischafgej 'g'ave her thdt' content; and so far insinu¬ated himself into' her favour and good opinion,that about' the 28th y ear of his age "she gave her-1self to him in marriage, being then forty years old;and from being servant, thus advanced him to hethe master both of her person and estate ; whichhavirig tendered him equal in wealth to the bestmen of the city, his ambitious mind began toentertain thoughts of possessing himself of thosovereignty over it.His' 'ancestors had, for several descents, beenchiefs of the tribe; and his great-grandfatherIlashem, had made himself very considerable, notonly at honie, but also amongst his neighboursabroad ; and had his father lived, the power andwealth of his family, after the death of his grand¬father, would have descended to him, as being theeldest son f ail'd"after his decease to himself; andit was only his'misfortune in being left an orphanduring the life of his grandfather, that deprivedhiUi of this.These Considerations, meeting with an ambitiousaspiring mind,"soon put'him upon designs of rais¬ing' himself to the supreme government of hiscountry.' Being a very subtile, crafty man, afterJlaving maturely weighed all ways and meanswhereby to bring this to pass, concluded none solikely to effect it, as the framing of that imposturewhich he afterwards vented with so much mischiefto the world.The course of trade which he drove into Egypt,Palestine, and Syria, having made him well ac¬quainted both with Jews and Christians, and ob¬serving with what eagerness they, and the several7sects into which the Christians of the east werethen miserably divided, did engage against eachother ; ho from thence concluded, that nothingwould be more likely to gain a party firm to him,for the compassing of his ambitious ends, than tiiemaking of a new religion : and, for such a change,he judged his fellow-citizens might be well disposed,because their traffic and frequent converse witliChristians, having much taken off their affectionand zeal for that gross idolatry which they hadhitherto been addicted to, they were at that timefrom Heathenism generally falling into Zendicism,ah error among the Arabs near of kin to thoSadducism of the Jews, as denying Providence,the Besixtrection, and a Future State; whichbeing in fact to be without any religion at all, theywere tho better fitted, while thus void of all otherimpressions of God, and his worship, to receive anyhe should impose upon them.Therefore,' betaking himself to frame such areligion as he thought might best go down withthem, he drew up a scheme of that Imposture heafterwards deluded them with; which being amedley made up of Judaism, the several heresiesof the Christians then in the east, and the oldPagan rites of the Arabs, with an indulgence toall sensual delights, it did too well answer hisdesign in drawing men of all sorts to the embracingof if.Hut that he plight not immediately, from thatidolatry’which lie had hitherto practised with therest of his citizens, commence a preacher againstit, arid from his present course of life, which wasvery licentious and wicked, take upon him a char¬acter so unsuitable to it, as that of a prophet,without some previous change; in the :18th year of8his age he withdrew himself from his former con¬versation, and affecting an Eremetical life, usedevery morning to withdraw himself into a solitarycave near Mecca, called the cave of Ilara, andcontinued there all day, exercising himself as hepretended, in prayers, fastings, and holy medita¬tions : and there, it is supposed, he first had hisconsults with those accomplices by whose help hemade his Alcoran.On his return home at night, he used to tell hiswife Cadigha of visions which he had seen, andstrange voices which he heard in his retirement;for he aimed first of all to draw her into the im¬posture, knowing that thereby he should secure hisown faculty to his design without which it wouldbo dangerous for him tto venture on it, and alsogain in her an able partizan for him among thewomen. But she rejecting these stories as vainfancies of his own disturbed imagination, or elsedelusions of the devil; at length he opened himselffurther unto her, and feigned a converse with theangel Gabriel, which she was also as backward tobelieve, till after repeated stories to her of hisrevelations from the said angel, she consulted witha fugitive monk, then in her house, who being inthe plot, helped to confirm her in the belief ofwhat Mahomet had communicated unto her,whereby being totally persuaded that Mahometwas really called to that prophetic office which hepretended to, from thenceforth gave up her faithtotally to him, and became his first proselyte inthis imposture.After he had carried this point, having now bytwo years constantly practicing a retired and austerelife, gained, as he thought, a sufficient reputationof sanctity for his design ; in the 40th year of his9age he began to take upon him the stylo of theApostle of GOD, and under that character to pro¬pagate the imposture which he had been so long inprojecting. But for four years, he did it only inprivate, among such as he had most confidence in,clancularly insinuating his delusions into them.His first proselyte, as has been said, was Cadighahis wife; his second was Zayd Ebn Hareth, hisservant; and the third his cousin Ali, the son ofAbu Taleb, his uncle, who, from hence, was usedto style himself the first of believers, not reckoningon the other two. He tempted his servant Zayd,by promising him his freedom ; and accordingly,on his receiving his religion, he manumised him.And from hence it hath become a law among theMahometans ever since, to make their slaves free,whenever they turn to their religion.It is to be observed, that Mahomet began thisimposture about the same time that the Bishop ofRome, by virtue of a grant from the wicked tyrantPhocas, first assumed the title of TJmversal Pastor,and thereon claimed to himself that supremacywhich he hath been ever since endeavouring tousurp over the church of Christ. And, from thistime, both having conspired to found themselvesan empire in imposture, their followers have beenever since endeavouring by the same methods, thatis, those of fire and sword, to propagate it amongmankind ; so that Antichrist seems at this time tohave set both his feet upon Christendom together,the one in the East, and the other in the West ;and how much each hath trampled upon the churchof Christ, the ages ever since succeeding haveabundantly experienced.Mahomet’s fourth disciple was Abu Beker, whobeing one of the richest men of Mecca, and a person10of great wisdom and experience, Lroug'it witli himgreat help and reputation to his tanse ‘ and hitexample was soon followed hv live oShtrst, UthnmuElm Allan, jSohair Ebno’l Aa’aln, brad.

If they had, with this their master,denied the Scriptures which we now have, as wellas the Trinity and the divinity of our Saviour,which are so evidently proved by them, and forgedothers in their stead, they might have made theirimpious hypothesis look much more plausable, thannow it can possibly appear to be.Mahomet pretended to have all his revelationsfrom the angel Gabriel, and that he was sent fromGod on purpose to deliver them unto him. Andwhereas he was subject to the ■ falling-sickness,whenever the fit was upon him, he pretended it wasa trance, and that then the angel Gabhiel camefrom GOD, with some new revelations unto him,the splendour of whose appearance he not beingable to bear, this caused him to fall into thesetrances, in which the angel conversed with him,and delivered to him those messages from GOD,which he was sent to reveal unto him.His pretended revelations he put into severalchapters, the collection of which make up his Alco¬ran, which is the Bible of the Mahometans. Theoriginal of this book he taught them, was laid upin the archives of heaven, and that the angelGabriel brought him the copy of it chapter by chap¬ter, according as occasion required they should bepublished to the people. Part ot these ho pub¬lished at Mecca, before his flight from thence, andthe other part at Medina; which he did after thismanner:—When he had forged a new chapter,which he intended to publish, he first dictated itto his Secretary, and then delivered the writtenpaper to be read to his followers, till they hadlearned it by heart; which being done, he had thepaper brought to him again, which he laid up in achest, which he called the Chest of his Apostleship.13This he did, I suppose, in imitation of the Ark, orHoly Chest, among the Jews, in which the authen¬tic copy of their Law was reposited. This chesthe left in the keeping of Hopsha, one of his wives;and out of it, after his death, was the Alcorancompiled, in the same manner as Homer’s rhapso¬dies were out of the loose poems of that poet.Abu Beker, who succeeded the Impostor, firstmade the collection. For when Mosailema, whoin the last year of Mahomet set up for a prophetas well as he, had, in hopes of the same success, inlike manner composed an Alcoran, and publishedit in a book to his followers, Abu Beker thought itnecessary to publish Mahomet’s also in the samemanner, and that not only in opposition to the newImpostor, but also for the better supporting of thatwhich he adhered to ; and therefore, having recourseto Haspha’s chest, partly out of the papers whichhe found there, and partly from the memory ofthose who had learned them by heart, when theImpostor first delivered them unto them, composedthe book: for several of those papers being lost,and others so defaced as not to be read, he wasforced to take in the assistance of those who pre¬tended to remember what the Impostor had taughtthem, to make up the whole ; and under this pre¬tence, made use of their advice to frame the book,as he thought would best answer his purpose.—When the work was completed, he caused the ori¬ginal to be laid up in the same chest, out of whichhe had compiled it, which he still continued in thekeeping of Hapsha, and then delivered out copiesof it among his followers.But the book had not been long published, whenso many various readings were got into the copies,and so many absurdities discovered in the book„14itself, that, wliea Othman vanie to be Caliph, litfound, it necessary, to cpll it in again to be put inka better shape : and therefore haviiig commandedall to bring in their copies under the pretence olVorreyting them by the original in the keeping oillaspha, he caused them all to be burned, andthen published the Alcoran, new modelled by him,now used ; of which, haying ordered ipuc copies tcbe written out fair, he deposited the first of thtjuat Mecca, and the second in Medina, the third heSent into Erack, or Chaldea, and the fourth intoSyria. Tho three first were after a while all lost,but the last of them, several ages after, was said tohe preserved at Damascus, in a mosque there, whichhad beep, formerly the church of St. John the.Bap¬tist. This was done in the 32nd year of theHegira, in the year 652, twenty-one years alterthe death of the Impostor; after which time toebook underwent, no other correction.On Mapomet’s first , appearing publicly as aprophet, t}ie people laughed at hint* fpr the ridicu¬lousness pf his pretence, some called him a sorcerer,apd a magician others, a liar, an impostor, apd ateller of old fables of which ho often complainsin .big Alcoran : so that for the first year }ie pre¬vailed nothing among them, or got apy thing piseby his publishing those cnapters ,of his Alcoran,which ho had thep composed, or his preaching tothem the dpctrine of them, but scorn and contemptBut tips did not disqourage him froni still proceed¬ing in his design, which he managed with, great.art; % fie wag a man -of a ready .wit, and a. veryacceptable address. He bore all afirqnts withoutseeming to. resent,any.; and. applied himself to allsorts of people, without contemning the meanest;was very courteous both in giving and receiving15visijts : the £'i;yat. Jie soothed with flattering[jraifi^s, and the poor ho relieved with giits andaims : and towards all men managed himself withthat art o| insinuatioil, tli^t atlength Ire surmountedall diliieulties, which so hold an imposture, in theiirSt voiding of it,, must necessarily bo liable unto ;aim several other new proSei^tes joined themselvpsiiuto him, among whom was Omar Ebno’l Chatuib,who was one of his successor^,-and then a consider-atile man in the city. His example was soon fol¬lowed by several others ; so that in the fifth yearof Ins pretended mission, hej had increased hisparty to the number of thirty-nine, and himselfmade the fortieth.On his having made this progress, several beganto ho alarmed af it. Those that were addicted tothe idolatry of their forefathers, stood up to opposoin nr. as: an enemy of the. Godg, and a dangerousinnovator in their religion.—But others, who sawluftlier into his designs, thought it time to put asfop thereto, for the .^ake, of the. public safety offli.e government, which it pianifestly fended toundermine, dor the establishing of tyranny pyertfieui; and, therefore, they combining togetheragainst him, intended to have cut him off. wi^h the.sword.. But Abu Taleh his uncle,. getting noticethereof, defeated the design ; and ,by ids. power,being chief of the. tribe, pfeseryed him from allother like attempts' ,as were afterwards framedagainst Ji-ini. gor although he; himself persistediii tlie Paganism of Ids ancestors, yet b^ had thataffection for the Impostor, being his binsman, andone that, was bred up in las bouse, that lip firmlystood by him against all Ids. enemies, and, wouldsuffer no. pne, to do him any hurt as. long^as lielived. And therefore being safe under, so power-.16ful a protection, he boldly went on to preach to pthe people in all public places of the city where |rthey used to assemble, and published unto themmore chapters of his Alcoran, in the order as hepretended, they were brought him by the angelGabriel. The chief subject of which, was to pressupon them the observance of some moral duties,the belief of the unity of God, and the dignity ofhis own pretended apostleship ; in which, besidessome Heathenish and Jewish rites which he retained, consisted the whole of his new religion.The main arguments which he made use of todelude men into this imposture, were his promisesand his threats, as being those which easiest workon the affections of the vulgar.—His promises werechiefly of Paradise, which he so cunningly framedto the gust of the Arabians, and to make it totallyconsist in those pleasures which they were mostdelighted with ; for they being within the torridzone, were, through the nature of the clime, aswell as the excessive corruption of their manners,exceedingly given to the love of women ; and thescorching heat and dryness of the country makingrivers of waters, cooling drinks, shaded gardens,and pleasant fruits, most refreshing and delightfulto them, they were from thence apt to place theirhighest enjoyment in things of this nature. Andtherefore, to answer the height of their carnaldesires, he made the joys of heaven, which he pro¬posed for a reward to all those that should believein him, to consist totally in these particulars. Forhe tells them in many places in his Alcoran, thatthey shall enter into pleasant gardens, where manyrivers flow, and many curious fountains continuallysend forth most pleasing streams, nigh which theywill repose themselves on most delicate beds.17: adorned with gold and precious stones, under the| shadow of the trees of Paradise, which shall con-! tinuallv yield them all manner of delicious fruits ;and that there they shall enjoy most beautifulwomen, pure and clean, having black eyes, andcountenances always fresh and white as polished, pearls, who shall not cast an eye on any other buti themselves, with whom they shall enjoy the con-j, tinual pleasures of love, and solace themselves in| their company with amorous delights to all eter-I! nity, drinking with them most delicious liquors,I and most savoury and pleasant wines, without beingi; ever intoxicated or overcharged by them, which!• shall be administered to them by beautiful boys,> who shall be continually running round their bedsI to serve them up unto them in cups of gold, andi glasses fixed on diamonds.And as thus he framed his promises of rewardin the life hereafter, as might best suit with the; sensual appetites and desires of those to whom heproposed them; so, on the contrary, he describedthe punishment of hell, which he threatened to allf that would not believe in him, to consist of sucht torments as would appear to them the most afflict¬ing and grievous to nature: As that they shouldi drink nothing but boiling and stinking water ; norbreathe any thing else but exceeding hot winds ;things most terrible in Arabia; that they shouldI dwell for ever in continual fire excessively burning,i and be surrounded with a black, hot, and saltsmoke, as with a coverlid ; that they should eatnothing but briers and thorns, and the fruit of theI tree zacon, which should be in their bellies likeburning pitch.In the proposing of these promises and threatsto the people, he was very frequent and sedulous,18leaking to ring in tlioir ears on all occasion?,wkere-By he failed not of'his end in alluring some,and afli'igliting others into the snare he laid forfhejn. And that ne niight omiit nothing vherekytp work on' their fear, yliich is usually the mostprevalent passion of the ignorant, he terrified themwifh the threats of grievous punishment in thislife/ as well as in that which is to come, if theywould not hearken unto him. And to this end hedid set forth unto them on all occasions, what ter-riWe destructions had fallen on the heads of sucli aswould npt be instructed by the prophets, that weresent before him. How the old world was destroyedhy water for not being reformed at the preachingof Noah ; and Sodom by fire from heaven for nothearkening to Lot when sent unto'them. How theEgyptians were plagued for despising Moses ; findhow Ad and Thamed, two ancient tribes of theArabs, were totally extirpated for the same reason.His stories of his two last were fables of his owninvention, which he related unto them after thismanner:—that Ad the grandson of Aram, the sonof Sem, planted himself after the confusion of lan¬guages in the southern parts of Arabia, there hisposterity falling into idolatry, the prophet Hud(whom the Commentators of the Alcoran will haveto be Heber) was sent to reclaim them into thetrue worship ; but they not hearkening unto him,God sent a violent hot wind, which in seven daysdestroyed them all excepting only the prophet, andsome few that were reformed hy him. As to hisstory of Thamed, he said that they were an ancienttribe of the Arabs, dwelling on the confines of Syria;and that on their revolt to idolatry God sent untothem the prophet Saleh ; that on (heir rderha^a ofa miracle to testify his mission, he cause'd h rock19to bring forth a camel in sight of them all ill—That they, notwithstanding, in contempt woundedthe camel; and that thereupon God sent terriblethunders, which in three days time destroyed themall, excepting Saleh, and some few who belieyedon him. Aud the like fable he also told them ofCliaib, another prophet of the ancient Ai’abs, sentto the tribe of Madian ; and how that tribe was inlike manner destroyed by thunder, for not heark¬ening unto him.Those who believed not on him called him ateller of fables, and demanded to see a miraclefrom him. For, said they, Moses and Jesus, andthe rest of the prophets, according to thy owndoctrine, worked miracles to prove their missionfrom God: and, therefore, if thou bo a prophet,and greater than any that were sent before thee,as thou boastest thyself to be, do thou work thelike miracles, to manifest it.—To this objection heanswered, that he was only sent to preach to themthe rewards of Paradise, and the punishments ofhell.In the beginning of his imposture, he seemedmore inclined to the Jews than to the Christians •and in the first forming of his new-inventedreligion, followed the pattern of theirs more thanany other. But after his coming to Medina, lietook that disgust against them, that he becametheir bitter and most irreconcilable enemy everafter, and used them with greater cruelty in hiswars than any other. But to Christians he overcarried himself v/ith as much favour as could beexpected from such a barbarian ; and whereverthey fell under his power, they had always goodterms from him.His general rule and which he laid as a strict20obligation upon all his followers, was to fight forthe propagation of his religion. And there wereonly two conditions on which he granted peace toany he had to do with ; and these wTere either tocome into his religion, or submit to be tributariesunto him. They that did the former, were admit¬ted into the same privileges and freedom with therest of his followers ; but the latter had only thebenefit of his protection, as to their goods and per¬sons, and the free exercise of their religion, withoutany other privilege or advantage whatsoever, forwhich every man paid an annual tribute. Butthose who would not come in, and make peacewith him on one of these two conditions, were, byhis law to be put to the sword. And this law, inevery one of its particulars, is still observed in allMahometan countries.However, this is certain, that Christians hadbetter terms from him than any other of his tri¬butaries, and they still enjoy them, there being noMahometan country where their religion is notesteemed the best next their own, and the pro¬fessors of it accordingly respected by them beforethe Jews, Heathens, or any other sort of men thatdiffer from them.As the Impostor allowed the Old and NewTestaments, so would he fain prove his missionfrom both. The texts which are made use of forthis purpose, by those who defend his cause, arethese following.Deuteronomy xxxiii. 2, it is said, “ The Lordcame from Sinai and rose from Seir unto them:he shineth forth from mount Pharan, and he camewith ten thousand of saints: from his right handwent a fiery Law for them”—By which words theywill have meant the coming down of the Law to21Moses on mount Sinai; of the Gospel to Jesus atJerusalem; and of the Alcoran to Mahomet atMecca. For, say they, Seir are the mountains ofJerusalem, where Jesus appeared ; and Pharan themountains of Mecca, where Mahomet appeared.But they are here much out in their geography,for Pharan is a city of Arabia Petrsea, near theRed Sea, towards the bottom of that gulph not farfrom the confines of Egypt and Palestine, abovefive hundred miles distant from Mecca.Psalm i. 2. We have it, “ Out of Sion theperfection of beauty God hath shined,” which theSyriac version reads thus, “ Out of Sion God hathshowed a glorious crown.” From whence someArabic translations have expressed the two wordsby Eclilian Mahmudan, that is, “ an honourablecrown.” By Mahmudan, they understand the nameof Mahomet, and so read the verse thus, “ Out ofSion hath God shewed the crown of Mahomet.”Isaiah xxi. 7. We read, “ And he saw a chariotwith a couple of horsemen, a chariot of asses, anda chariot of camels.” But the Old Latin versionhath it, “ Et vidit currwn duorum equiturn, ascen-sorem asini, et ascensorem cameli," that is, “ And hesaw a chariot of two horsemen, a Rider upon anass, and a Rider upon a camel.” Where, by the, Rider upon an ass, they understand Jesus Christ,because he did so ride to Jerusalem, and by therider on the camel, Mahomet, because he was ofthe Arabians, who used to ride upon camels.John xvi. 7. Our Saviour tells his disciples,“ If I go not away the Comforter will not comeunto you ; but if I depart, I will send him untoyou.” By the Comforter, the Mahometans willhave their prophet Mahomet to be here meant;and therefore among other titles which they gavebijliim in (heir language, one is Paraclct. tvIucIi is (lie(livek won!'here used in (his text for the fomfortev,rofulo Arabic. They also say, that the very nameof Mahoiitei both here and in othipr places' of theX'kvipel was expressly mentioned, Wit' th(it the(.'hrisivans, out of malice, have blotted it out, andronnpted these holy writings; and that1 at Paristheir 'is a, copy of these Gospels without these cor¬ruptions, in which the coining of Mahomet is fore¬told in several places, wlierehisnanie is expresslylaVntiou'ed'ih 'them. And some such thing thevhad heed to say to justify the imprudent lie of thisfvnpostoi, who m the sixty-first chapter of his Alco¬ran', entitled, The Chapter of Batfle, hath thesewords, Remember that Jesus, the Son of Mary,said to the children of Israel, I am the Messengerof God, lie hath sent me to confirm the Old Testa-nioiit, and to declare unto you, that there shallcome a prophet after mo, whose name shall heMahomet.There needs no answer to confute these glosses.The absurdity of them is sufficiently exposed bybarely relating them. And since they could findnn'thino: else in all the books of the Old and NewTestaments to wrest to their purpose, but thesetexts before-mentioned, which are‘to every man’sappreliendiiig so exceedingly void of it; these showat how vast a difference the true word of God isfrom this impious imposture, and how much it isin all its parW contrary thereto.And thus‘far I have laid together as exactly andparticularly as I could, out of the best authors thattreat of this Impostor,' all that is <;redibly related of11ini', and thosemethods which.he took for the fram¬ing and propagating that impious forgery, which hehath imposed lipbn So large a part of mankind.The Angels' intercession for Man's redemption,M ankind having for t^e long ami tedious space ofmore than five thousand years continued in a mis¬erable state of exile, not one of them being able toshake off the clog of original guilt, and soar to hisnative country, Heaven; the blessed choir of angelicspirits, (moved to compassion, and concerned atthe dreadful havock sin had made among them, asWell as solicitous to see the numbers of their ownheavenly legions again completed,) as soon as thefulness of time was come, resolved to renew' theinstances they had often before made to the Al¬mighty. For this end, presenting themselves be¬fore the awful throne of God, with redoubled earnest¬ness and devotion, they jointly prostrated them¬selves at his feet, and made the following prayer :—“All-merciful Lord! Remember how you gra¬ciously vouchsafed, from the inexhaustible fund ofyour goodness, to create man out of nothing, andto raise him above all,/(he works of your sublu¬nary creation, by enriching him with the eminentgift of a rational soul, capable of knowing you, andthis on purpose that he might become a partakerof our felicity, and repair the loss we sustained bythe fall of our reprobate brethren. Yet behold, ()gracious Sovereign, the whole species lies still in¬volved in such woeful ruin, that out of so great anumber, not one has been able to escape and arrivehither in the long space of many thousand years.< hir enemies thence gather new matter of triumph :when instead of seeing the vacant places of the fallenangels filled, they behold hell continually crowdedwith innumerable victims: to what end, then,are they created, O Lord? Why are the souls that24confess to you, delivered up a prey to beasts ? Ps.Ixiiii. We are not ignorant, that this severityperfectly agrees with your divine justice ; yet bepleased, 0 Lord, to remember, that the time forshewing your mercy is come. If the first progeni¬tors of the human race did unhappily transgressyour law ; let your mercy now repair the injury intheir wretched posterity. Be mindful that youcreated them to your own likeness. Extend thenin pity, 0 God, your hand to them, and replenishthem with your bounty. To this end, “ Our eyesf .ved on you, as the eyes of servants on the hands oftheir masters, (Ps. cxxii.) till you deign to havecompassion on mankind, and save them by a plen-Mtul redemption.”mroi

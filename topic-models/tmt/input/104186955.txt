THE PLEASING ARTOFiIONEY-C ATCHING,AND ,-THKWAY TO THEI.VE, BY TURNING A PENNY TOADVANTAGE;WITH A NEW METHOD OFREGULATING DAILY EXPENSES.GLASGOW:PRINTED FOR THE BOOKSELLERS.68.BONDGATE STUEET.PLEASING ARTOFMONEY-CATCHING.When commerce and traffic was first begun inthe world, and men came to trade one with an¬other, there was no use for money, nor need oiit; for men bartered their goods in exchange witheach other; and as in the infancy of the world,some were tillers of the ground and others werekeepers of sheep ; the one gave the other corn,and took of their sheep in exchange for it. Andthis sort of trading is now generally in use in ourforeign plantations, to supply the want of mon¬ey. But in process of time, as trading increased,so did luxury begin to abound ; and as luxury a-bounded, so men’s wants grew greater, whichbegat a necessity of some other way of commerce,and this was money ; which is of such antiquity,that Josephus tells us, that Cain, (the son ofAdam, and the first born of men) was very greedyin gathering money together, though of whatmetal that money was made, and whether it wascoined or not he is silent.Herodotus writeth that the first that coinedBONDOATE STIIEET.4silver and gold, to buy and sell with, were theLydians. For silver and gold being the mostprecious of metals, were so much valued, thatwhatever any man wanted, might be purchasedfor it.Homer indeed tells us that before the siege ofTroy, men used to change or barter one commo¬dity for another. But it is undeniable that mon¬ey was in use long before that time; for whenAbraham purchased the field of Machpelah, andthe field in which it was, for a burying place forhis family, he gave four hundred shekels of sil¬ver for it: which the secret texts tells us wascurrent money with the merchant; and that wasabout the year of the world 2088, which wasnear 700 years before the destruction of Troy.But though the money was current with the mer¬chant, yet I question whether it was coined ornot; for it rather appears, that it received its valuefrom its weight than from any stamp, that wasupon it: the weight of an shekel being a quar¬ter of an ounce, and the true value of that 15pence of our money. Abraham paid £25 Eng¬lish money, for that burying place.We read likewise of pieces of silver, or silver-lings, before this, which was current money a-mong the nation at that day ; for Abimelech, kingof Gerar, having taking Abraham’s wife from him,5upon a supposition that she was his sister whenhe came to understand the truth of the matter,not only restored Ids wife to him again, but alsogave him a thousand pieces of silver or silverlings;the value of which thousand pieces (each piecebeing worth 2s 6d) came to £125-1 Os. which atthat day was a noble present for a king to give.But besides shekels and silverlings, there weretalents aiso, the weight of which was 7.5 ounces.A taleutof silver contained the valueof£]87. 10 s.Of each of these .coins there is frequent mentionin the Holy Scriptures of the Old Testament.In the New Testament, Our Saviour command¬ed Peter to take up the fish that first came tohand, and when he had opened its mouth heshould find therein a piece of money, which hewas to take and give the tax-gatherers for hisMaster and himself: w'hieh piece of money wrascalled a Stator, which consisted of half an ounceof silver, the value of which was 2 shillings.And when the Jews came to ensnare our Saviour,about the lawfulness of paying tribute to Ctesar,he desired them to shew the tribute-money, andthey shewed him a penny, of value 7d-halfpenny ;and that this money was coined and stamped,appears by our Saviour’s asking them, whose im¬age and superscription was upon it? to whichthey answered, Caesar.BONDGATE STIiEET.But I need not quote Scripture to prove thatthe Jews and Romans used to coin money, theimage and superscription giving a value to it, andpromoting the currency of it; for silver was coinedin Rome, in the year of the world 3672, whichwas about 300 years before the Christian sera.History tells us that silver was first of all coin¬ed in the Isle Engina and that in Rome it wasstamped with the impression of a chariot and hor¬ses. And Janus caused brass to be coined witha face on the one side, and a ship on the other,in memory of Saturnus, who arrived there in aship. Servius Tullius, a king of the Romans,first coined brass with the image of a sheep andan ox. And in some places leather cut into pie¬ces has had the stamp of authority put upon it,and so it was made to pass for money. And inNew England, the Indians have money whichthey call Wampompege, which is of two sorts,one white, which they make of the stem or stockof the periwinkle, which they call Meteaubockt,when all the shell is broken off; and of this sortsix of their small beads, (which they make withholes to string the bracelets) are current with theEnglish for a penny. The other sort is blackinclining to blue, which is made of the shell of afish, which they call Pequanhock; and of thissort three make an English penny. They wholive upon the sea-side generally make of it, andas many make as will, none being denied tiie li¬berty of making it. This coin of money the In¬dians set such a value upon, that they bring downall sorts of furs which the/ take in the country,and sell to the Indians and English too, for thisIndian money; and the currency of it amongthem, makes them look on it as a good equival¬ent for what commodites they have to sell.Both the English, Dutch, and French tradeingto the Indians with it, above six hundred milesnorth and south from England; which is suffi¬cient to shewr, that the use of money is very an¬cient, and is made use of by all nations in trade¬ing w ith each other; and was first invented asa medium in trade, and an equivalent to all sortsof commodities.The Misety of those that want Money and arein Debt.! on r O-i , r 1 1There is no wise man that will covet moneyfor itself, but for the use that is to be made ofit; for money itself cannot satisfy ; and so we aretold by the wisest of men, Eccles. v. 10. hie thatloveth silver shall not be satisfied with silver;nor he that loveth abundance with increase.”—In a time of famine, or in a besieged city, a manBONDOATE STIIEET.smay have money enough by him, and yet maywant a piece of bread. Money therefore is prizednot for itself but for its use; because,, as Solo¬mon also says, “ Money answers all things.”And seeing without money a man can have no¬thing, they must be very miserable that are with¬out it.Charity, in this last and iron age of the world,is grown so cold, that there is scarce any thingto be got upon that account. If you are cold,charity will not warm you; neither, if you arehungry will it fill your belly ; but if you havemoney, you may do both.If you have money, you may become one ofthe Livery-men of London, an Assistant, a War¬den, ora Master of a Company: but if you wantmoney, you will never arrive to the honour of abeadle; for even for such an inferior employmentyou must make friends, and that cannot be donewithout bribes, nor can you bribe without money.If you have money, you may be an honest man,and a good man ; but if you want money, youmust be a knave by consequence.Enquire of a rich man among his neighbourswhat he is, meaning only whether he be a sub¬stantial man, and one that is responsible ; and,they will presently tell you, “ he’s a very goodman I’ll assure you though at the same time,9with respect to his morals, he is as profligate afellow as any in the whole parish, and one thatlives by oppressing his neighbours, and doing allmanner of injustice; his money making amendsfor all his enormities.I knew a certain tradesman in London, thathad an uncle, a rich- covetous fellow, that wasworth many a thousand ; this poor man addressedhimself to his uncle, to give him a £100 to sethim up ; but he knew the worth of money betterthan to part with it, before death forced it fromhim, and told him plainly, he would give him no¬thing while he lived, but it might be he wouldleave him something when he died, especially ifhe found him industrious, and that he put him¬self in a way to live. The poor man had but lit¬tle money, and less credit, and how to put him¬self in a way to live he knew not ^his trade beingnone of the best for journeymen. However, pick¬ing up a little credit at one place, and a little atanother, he addressed himself to the company hewas free of and would fain have borrowed £50of them; but truly they would not lend it him,but upon such security as he could not procure;in this extremity having put himself into a shop,he goes again to his uncle, to desire him to lendhim a little money, telling him he had set up intrade, and was got into a shop, but wanted mon-BONDGATE STHEET.ey to carry on his business, and desired him tolend him a little. His uncle finding he was get¬ting into a way, out of his generosity lends him£20 ; but makes him give him a bond to pay himin a year’s time. The poor man had almost aswell been without his money, as to have been un¬der such an obligation; but he was resolved tokeep touch with him, though he lived so poorlyall the while that he was the scorn of all hisneighbours and fellow tradesmen, who looked up¬on him as a poor and consequently a pitiful fellow:but for all that he paid his uncle the £20 withinthe time limited; which his uncle took so well,that he told him, since he took such care tokeep his word, he would remember him anothertime. And so he did; for having neither wifenor child, when he died, he divided his estate a-mongst his relations, and left this poor kinsmanof his, thirty thousand pounds in ready money,and £1500 per annum. And nowr this poor man,whose poverty made him the scorn of his neigh¬bours and acquaintances before, became a verygood man all on a sudden, insomuch that thecity took notice of him, and chose him sheriff thevery next year; and the company that before re¬fused to lend him £50, now chose him theirmaster, and were all his humble servants; and hewas applauded and cried up by every one. Here11was now a mighty change, and yet the man wasthe same still; it was money only made thedifference. Judge therefore whether want ofmoney be not an extraordinary misery, and agreat unhappiness.This puts me in mind of a story, I have heardrelated of Jocelin Percy, Esqr., brother to theEarl of Northumberland, who going by a but¬cher’s shop, near Cow-Cross affronted his dog,who thereupon fell a-barking at him, and theEsquire drew his sword and run him through.The butcher, who was troubled for the loss ofhis dog, charged a constable with the Esquire,who carried him before a Justice that knew himnot; the Justice asked him why he killed thebutcher’s dog? The Esquire answered him verycarelessly, because the dog ran at him. Ran atyou ! says Mr. Justice. Howt did he run at you ?To which Percy ( being a comical sort of a man )replied, He ran at me thus, Bough ! wough!wough ! and therewith taking a little run at theJustice, threw him and his chair down together!Which Mr. Justice looked upon as such affrontto his worship, that nothing would ator.e for, butcommitting him to Newgate, aggravating thecrime of killing the butcher’s dog, telling him,his dog was his servant, and that for ought heknewT, himself or some of his gang, designed toBONDGATE STIiEET.12rob his ship; but he would make an example O'him. Percy seemed very little concerned awhat the Justice said', which provoked him tinmore ; and therefore he called the clerk ta makt |his mittimus, who asking him what his namtwas, he said Jocelin. What besides Jocelin fsaid the Glerk, Percy, said he. Of what place?replied the Clerk. Of Northumberland-house,,near to Charing-Cross,. said he. The Justicehearing this and knowing there was a very com¬ical gentleman of that name, who was brother tothe Earl of Northumberland, then a great favour¬ite with his Majesty, changed his tone at once,and asked him if he was brother to the Earl? Onbeing answered in the affirmative, he addressedhimself to the butcher in an angry tone, tellinghim that he would examine into the affair, andthat he would learn him better than let his dogloose to molest gentlemen as they walked thestreet, and that he would have him bound overto the peace at the Quarter-Sessions for his futurebehaviour. Which he would have done, and per¬haps more, had not Percy interfered in his behalf.At this alteration the poor butcher was-terrified.The Justice then addressed himself to the Es¬quire, and begged his pardon for using him insuch a manner, imputing it to his not knowinghis quality. The Esquire, with a smile, replied13that he must also beg his pardon for throwing-him and his chair over.. The Justice answered”there was no offence.Thus we may see the misery of wanting mon¬ey. The butcher could certainly have punishedPercy for killing his dog in such an unprovokedmanner, and would have obtained it, had not theJustice discovered Percy’s family, and let Jus¬tice wink rather than offend the brother of a fav¬ourite of his Majesty’s. The poor butcher mustnot only content himself with the loss of his dog,mt be glad he escaped so well. It is just, so’generally speaking, in every state of life; if anan be ever so virtuous and of the best princi-’les,if wants that principle, money, he wantswery thing, and is looked upon as a mean piti-ul fellow : on the contrary, ifa man be possessedif that, he has every thing, though otherwise ofahe most consummate ignorance, debauched life,md insignificant conversation.I confess, if we look backward into the better>d wiser ages of the world, virtue, thoughi outhed in rags, was more esteemed than theappings of the gold ass; it is in these last andWst of days that vice has got such an ascen-nt in the world, as to make men think all thate poor are miserable; for in the primitive'mes, poverty was the badge of religion andBONDGATE STHEET.piety; and well it might, for not many great,nor many noble were called; and the study olwisdom, and contempt of the world was then inesteem among the wisest philosophers in theearliest ages. But as Ovid, saysThe times are chang’d, and even weSeem changed with times to be.So that in those times, considering the miser}of wanting money is so great, we may say witfthe wise man, “ My son, it is better to die thaito be poor which saying was perhaps the occasion of an old miser’s mistake, who bid his soiobserve what Solomon said, “ Always keep spenny in your pocket.” But his son answere*again, he did not remember that Solomon sabany such thing. The miser replied, then Solomon was not so wise as I took him to be.Indeed money’s now become the worldly mangod, and the card which the devil turns wtrumph to win the game;. for it gives birthbreeding, beauty, honour, and credit; and makethe possessors think themselves wise, thougtheir very thinking so, declares them fools. Bebecause money answers all things, and is in suevogue with the world, therefore many are swilling to purchase it though with the loss «soul and body.But the want of money does not only cans?n to be condemned and ridiculed, but it alsots men upon taking wicked and unlawfularses to obtain it: which made one say.!

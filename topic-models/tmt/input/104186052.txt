Xl 1 i’Tis kind, therefore, I winna striveMy doughty deeds here to descrive,A lightsome life still did I thrive.Did never itch.By out an’ in abouts to drive,For to mak rich.I ne’er laid money up in store,Into a hole behind the door,A shilling, penny, less or more,I aye did scatter,’Tis just, now, I should drink, therefore,Sma’ beer or water.I never sooner siller got,But a’ my pouches it would plot,And scorch them fair, it was sac hot;Then to get clearOf it, I swill’d it down my throat.In ale or beer.Thus, a’ my failing was my glass.An’ anes to please a bonny lass,I, like a silly amorous ass.Drew forth my gully.An’ through an’ through at the first pass,Ran Mr. Willy.toSae far this mad, though merry fit,I was sair vexed, and forced to flit,They plagu’d me sae wi’ pay and sit.Quo’ they, You thief,How durst you try to steal a bitForbidden beef?0 then, I humbly plead that vos.Would make it your continual nws,Wi’ hearts sincere an’ open os,You’d often pray,A tali malo libera nos,0 Dominie,For, hark, I’ll tell you what they think,Since I left handling pen an’ ink :Wae worth that weary soup o’ drinkHe lik’d sae weel,He drank it a’, left not a clinkHis throat to swill.He lik’d, still sitting on his doup.To view the pint or cutty stoup,And sometimes lasses overcoup,Upo’ their keels,This made the lad at length to loup,And tak his heels.jThen was it not a grand presumption,jTo ca’ him doctor o’ the function 'j|He dealt too much in barley-unctionFor his profession :He never took a good injunctionFrae kirk or session.n’ to attend, he was not willing,[is school, sae lang’s ho had a shilling.But lov’d to be where there was fillingGood punch or ale,or him to rise was just like killingOr first to fail.“I6His fishing-wand, his sneeshing box,A fowling piece, to shoot niuir codes.An’ hunting hare through craigs and.rocks,This was his game,Still left the young anes, so the foxMight worry them.When he committed a’ these tricks,For which he weel deserv’d his licks,Wi’ red-coats he did intermix,When he foresawThe punishment the kirk inflictsOn fowks that fa’.Then to his thrift he bade adieu.When wi’ his tail he stopp’d his mou’.He changed his coat to red and blue,An’ like a sotDid the poor Clerk convert intoA Royal Scot.i .fk.-i-r ' 1•yinoe buAn’ now fowks use me at their wills.My name is blawn out o’er the hills,At banquets, feasts, a’ mouths it fills,’Twixt each, Here's i' the”',’Tis sore traduc’d at kilns and mills,And common smithy.Then, Dominies, I you beseech,Keep very far from Bacchus’ reach.He drown’d a’ my cares to preach,Wi’ his ma’t-bree,I’ve wore sair banes by mony a bleechO’ his tap-tree.7If venus does possess ydtir mind,Her antics ten times Varso ye’ll find,For to ill tricks she’s sae inclin’d,For praticks past,.She blew me here before the wind :Within years less than half a dizen.IThis of my quiet cut the wisen,Whan ho wan gae.In case they wear the sacken weed,For fornication,Or leave the priest-craft shot to deadFor procreation.But better ’twere to tak her hame,Their pot to cook,An’ teach his boys to write a theme,And mind their book.]Then may they sit at hame, an’ please,iThemselves wi’ gathering in their fees,lAVhile I must face mine enemies.Or shaw my dock:■There’s odds ’twixt handling pens wi’ easeAn’ a firelock.Cauld be her cast.i She made poor Maggy lie in jizen,When little Jock brake out of prison,On gude yule-day,Let readers then tak better heed.For fear they kiss mair than they read,The maist o’ them, like blind an’ lame.Have nae aversion to the game.8Sae shall they never mount the stool,Whereon the lasses greet an’ howl,Tho’ deil a tear, scarce fair or foul.Comes o’er their cheeks ;Their mind’s not there, ’tis spinning wool, 1Or mending breeks.The Kirk then pardons no such prots,They must tell down good live pounds scots.Though they should pledge their petticoats,An’ gae arse bare ;The least price there is twenty groats,An’ prigging fair.If then the lad does not her wed.Poor Meg some feigned tears maun shed.Her minny crooks her mou’ and dad.They fart an’ fling ;“ 0 wow that e’er I made the bed,”Then does she sing.Thus for her Maidenhead she moans,Beicailing ivhat is past;Her pitcher's dash'd against the stones,And broken at the last.PART II.A’ Maids, therefore, I do bemoan,Betwixt the rivers Dee and Don,If anes they get a taste o’ yon,Though by the laird,The toy-mutch maun then gae on,Nae mair bare-hair’d9|Yet wanton Venus, that she-b—h,Does a’ our senses sae bewitch,An’ fires our blood wi’ sic an itch,That aftentimes,There is nae help hut to commit,. Some Ill-far’d crimes.BYet some they are sae very willing,At ony time they’ll tak’ a shilling,i But he that learnt them first that spelling,Or Meg or Nell,Be sure, to him they’ll lay an egg in ;This some can telhI Unthinking things ! it is their creed,If some sic things be done wi’ speed,They’re safe, ’tis help in time o’ need,Nae after-claps :Tho’ nine months aft brings quick or dead,Into their laps.! Experience thus makes me speak,I ance was hooked wi’ the cleek,I almost had beshit my breek.When Maggy told,That by her saul, not e’en a weekYoung Jack would hold.She was sae stiff she cou’d not loot;Your pranks she says, are now found out,The kirk and you maun hae a bout ;111 mat you fare,'Tis a’ your ain, you need na doubtIlk hilt an hair.10Alas that e’er I saw your face,I can nae langer hide the case ;Had I foreseen this sad disgrace,Nae man nor you,Shou’d e’er hae met me in yon place,Or kiss’d my mou’.O Dominie, you’re dispossest,Ye hae defil’d your holy nest,The warld sees ye hae transgrest,I’m at my time,Ye dare nae mair, now do your best,Let gae the rhyme.Ohon! how weel I might hae kent,When first to you I gae consent,Wi’ me to mak your merriment,How a’ would be :Alas ! that e’er my loom I lentThat day to thee.Wae to the night I first beganTo mix my moggans wi’ thee man :’Tis needless now to curse or ban,But deil hae me,Ye’ll pay an’ sit, for sit ye can,An’ that ye’ll see.I heard her as I heard her not.But time and place had quite forgot,I guess’d Young Jack fell to my lot;For I could tell,It was too short her petticoat,By half an ell.11Wi’ blubber’d cheeks, and watry nose,Her weary story she did close ;I said the best, and aff she goesJust like a thief,An’ took a glass to interpose,’Twixt mirth and grief.Yet would hae gi’en my ha’f year’s fee,Had Maggy then been jesting me,Had tartan purry, meal an’ bree,Or buttr’y brose,Been kilting up her petticoatsAboon her hose.But time that tries such pratioks past.Brought me out o’er the coals fu’ fast ;Poor Maggy took a sudden blast.And o’er did tumble.For something in her wame at lastBegan to rumble.Our folk ca’d it the windy gravel,That grips the guts beneath the navel,But laith was she for to unravelTheir gross mistake,Weel kend she, that she was in travail,Wi’ little Jack.| But, to put matters out of doubt,Young John within would fain been out,An’ but an’ ben made sic a routI Wi’ hands and feet,| That she began twa-fauld aboutThe house to creep.12 -■Then dool an’ sorrow interveen’d ;For Jack nae langer could be screen’d,My lass upon her breast she loan’d,An’ gae a skirl.The canny wires came there conveen’d,An’ in a whirl.They wrought together in a crowd ;By this time I was under cloud ;Yet bye and bye I understood.They made one more,For Jack he tun’d his pipe, and loudWi’ cries did roar.Wi’ that they blam’d the Session-Clark ;Where is the lown hid in the dark ?For he’s the father o’ this wark :Swear to his mither,He’s just as like him as ae larkIs like anither.About me then there was a din,They sought me out through thick an’ thin,Wi’ deil hae her, an deil hae him,He’s o’er the dyke ;Our Dominie has now dung inHis arse a pike.Ye may weel judge I was right sweer,This uncouth meeting to draw near.Yet forc’d I was thou to appear,Altho’ perplex’d;But listen how, and ye shall hear.The hags me vex’d.13i The callings Maggy had sae cleuked,i Before young Jack was rightly hooked,They made her twice as little booked,But to gae on,0 then ! how like a fool I looked,When I saw John.U The Cummer then came to me bent,And gravely, did my son present ;I She bade me kiss him, be content,Then wish’d me joy ;An’ tauld it was—what luck had sent,A. -waly boy.In ilka member, lith an’ lim’,Its mouth, its nose, its cheeks, its chin,’Tis a’ like daddy, just like him,I His very self,Though it look’d cankered sour and grim,Like ony elf.Then whisp’ring now to me she harked,Indeed your hips they should be yarked,Nae mair Mess John, nor dare ye Clarkit,Faith ye hae ca’dYour hogs into a bonny markit,Indeed my lad.But tell me, man, (I should say master,)What muckle deil in your way chas’d her ?Lowns baith ! but I think I hae plac’d her,Now on her side,My coming here has not disgrac’d her,At the Yule-tide.HAn’ for yoursell, ye dare na lookHereafter ever on a book,Your mou’ about the psalms to crook ;Ye’ve play’d the fool,Auither now your post maun bruik,An’ you the stool.She bann’d her saul, and then she blest it.That in the Kirk books it would be lifted.An’ thus the weary wife insisted.Our LettergaeWill sit whar he will not be pish’t atBy dogs some day.She wrung her hands until they cracked,An’ sadly me she sham’d an’ lacked—Ah, man ! the Priest, how will he tak’ it,Whan he hears tell,How Maggy’s mitten ye hae glacket,Ye ken yoursell.The Session-Clark to play such prankies.Ye’ll stan’ I fear upon your shankies.An’ maybe slaver in the brankies ;It could na miss.But lifting o’ the killimankies,Would turn to this.A toothless Howdy, auld and teugh.Says, Cummer husht, we hae eneugh,Thirsh mony ane has touch’d the plough,As gude ash he,An’ yetsh gane backlunsh o’er the heugh,Shae let him be.Ilesh no, quoth she, though he’sh be lear’d,That ye ken what, they hae crept near’t,Far you an I hash aft-times heardO’ nine or ten,Wha thush the clergy hath beshmear’dWi’ their ain pen.The auld mou’d wives thus did me taunt,Though a’ was true, I must needs grant,But ae thing maistly made me faint,Poor Meg lay still,| An’ look’d as loesome as a saintThat kend nae ill.Then a’ the giglets young and gaudy,Sware by their sauls, I might be wady,For getting sic a lusty laddy,Sae like mysell;An’ made me blush wi’ speaking baudy,’Bout what befel.Thus auld an’ young their verdict had,’Bout Maggy’s being brought to bed,I thought my fill, yet little said,Or had to say,To reap the fruit o’ sic a trade,On gude-yule day.What sometimes in the mou is sweet.Turns litter in the wame ;(/rumbled sair to get the geet.At sic a merry time.PART III.ow Maggy’s twasome in a swoon,counsel held condemns the loon,1(5The cushle mushle thus gaed roun’,Our bonny Clark,He’ll get the dud an’ sarken gown.That ugly sark.Consider, sirs, now this his crime,’Tis no like hers, or yours, or mine,He’s just next thing to a divine.An’ vow, ’tis odd.Sic men should a’ their senses tine.An’ fear o’ God.’Tis strange what mak’s kirk folk sae stupit,To mak or meddle wi’ the fuca’it,Or mint to preach in sic a pu’pit,The senseless fools,Far better for them hunt the tyouchot,Or teach their schools.They hunt about frae house to house,Just as a tailor hunts a louse.Still girding at the barley-juiceAn’ aft get drunk,They plump into some open sluice,Where a’ is sunk.A plague upo’ that oil o’ ma’t,That weary drink is a’ their fau’t,It made our Dominie to hal’t;The text fulfil,Which bids cast out the sa’rless sa’t.On the dunghill.17They are sae fed, they lie sae saft,They are sae hain’d, they grow sae daft;This breeds ill wiles, ye ken fu’ aftI I tald them then, it was but wicked' ] To add affliction to the afflicted.But to it they were sae addicted,They said therefore :■ The clout about me should be pricked,At the kirk-door.:1 But yet not kirk nor consterie,| Quoth they, can ask the taudy fee,« m Tiii * i • i , .1l For tarry-breeks should ay gae free,An’ he’s the Clark.I then was dumb ! how I was griev’d !i What would I gi’en to be reliev’d!They us’d me waur than I had thiev’d,Some strain’d their lungs,n An’ very loud they me mischiev’dWi’ their ill tongues.Had you been there to hear and seemanner how they guided me,greater penance wha could dree !In the black coat,Till poor Mess John, and the priest-craft,Gaes to the pot.Tell them in words just twa or three,The deil a plack,A Lettergae,Wi’ sic a pack confin’d to be,On gude Yule-day.18Young Jack wi’ skirls he pierc’d the skies,I pray’d that death might close his eyes,But did not meet with that surprise,To my regret,Sae had nae help, but up an’ criesIlet drinks to get.This laid their din ; the drink was stale.An’ to’t they gaed wi’ tooth an’ nail,An’ wives whase rotten tusks did failWi’ bread an’ cheese,They birl’d fu’ fast at butter’d ale.To gie them ease.They ca’ upon me, then dadda.Come, tune your fiddle, play us aJigg or hornpipe, nae mair 8UL FA,My bonny cock ;The kirk an’ you maun pluck a crawAbout young Jock.Play up, Sae merry as we hae been,Or, Wat ye wha we met yestreen.Or, Lass will ye lend me your lepm ?Or, Soups o’ brandy.Or, Gin the kirk wad let’s alane,Or, Houghmagandy.Sic tunes as these, yea, three or four.They call’d for, ill mat they cour,Play, cries the cummer, wi’ a glour,The wanton toudy,Wha’ did the Dominie ding o’er,Just heels o’er goudy.19O’ music I had little skill,But as I could, I played my fill.It was my best to s’haw good will ;Yet a’ my drift,Was best how I might win the hillThe wives to shift.Sae leaving them to drink ,het ale,I slipt awa’, an’ let them rail:Then running till my breath did fail,I was right gladFrae kirk and wives to tak’ leg bail,—Xae doubt they said.The Lettergae has plaid the fool.And shifted the repenting-stool,To kirk and session bids good-day,He'll o'er the hills and far away.THE SEQUEL.Novr, loving friends I bae you left,Ye ken I neither stole nor reft,But when I found myself infeft,In a young Jack,I did resolve to change the haftFor that mistak’.An’ reasons mao I had anew.For I had neither horse nor cow ;My stock took wings an’ aff it flew,Sao a’ was gone,An’ deil a flee had I was newExcept young John.Too aft my thirsty throat to cool,I went to visit the punch bowl,Which makes me now wear reddish woolInstead o’ black ;Or I must foot the cutty stoolWi’ deil a plack.The chappen-stoup, the pint an’ gill,Too aft I caused for to fill,Ay loving those wha would sit still.An’ wet the mouth,A e’er minding that the Tumo-HiLt,Leads people south.0 but that loving laird KingswellsMy blessings flow where his foot swells,Lang life to him whate’er befals,God be his guide,He’s cured a thousand thirsty sauls,An’ mine beside.0 had I but thae days again,Which I sae freely spent in vain,I’d strive some better for to ken.What future chanceShould bla”’' me here out o’er the main,An’ sae near France.But since that ills maun ay befallThe chiel that will be prodigal;When wasted to the very spaulHe turns his tusk,For want o’ comfort to his saul,On hungry husk.Now since I’m aff sae mony a mile,There’s naething got without some toil,I’ll wait; cross fortune yet may smile,Come want, come wealth,I’ll tak’ a pint in the mean while,To Heilden’s health.Sae, for a time, friends fare ye weel,My pot companions, true and leel,I wish ye all a merry yule.Much mirth and gleeNae mair young Jacks into the creelThat day for me.Some other Yule may yet cast up.When ice again shall meet,To drown our sorrows in a cup,In case we live to see’t.ELEGY ON MAGGY JOHNSTONWho died Anno Domini, 1711Auld Reeky mourn in sable hue.Let fouth o’ tears dreep like May dew,To bra’ tippeny bid adieu,Which we wi’ greed.Bended as fast as she could brew,But now she’s dead.22To tell the truth now, Maggy dang,O’ customers she had a bang ;For lairds an’ sutors a’ did thrangTo drink bedeen ;The barn an’yard was aft sae thrang,We took the green.An’ there by dizens wo lay down,Syne sweetly ca’d the healths aroun’,To bonny lasses, black or brown,As we lo’ed best;In bumpers we dull cares did drown,An' took our rest.When in our pouch we fand some clinks,An’ took a turn o’er Bruntsfield Links,Aften in Maggy’s, at Hay-jinks.We guzzl’d scuds,Till we could scarce, wi’ hale-out drinksCast aff our duds.We drank an’ drew, an’ fill’d again,O wow! but we were blythe an’ fain :When ony had their count mistane,0 it was nice,To hear us a’ cry pick your bane.An’ spell your dice.^ou close we us’d to drink an’ rant,Jntil we baith did glowr and gaunt,W pish, an’ spue, an’ yesk* an’ maunt,Right swash I trow,.’hen aff auld stories wo did ohaunt,Whan we were fou.23Whan we were wearied at the gouff.Then Maggy Johnston’s was our houff,Now a’ our gamesters may sit douff,Wi’ hearts like lead.Death wi’ his rung reach’d her a youfi',An’ sae she’s dead.Maun we he forc’d thy skill to tine.For which we will right sair repine ?Or hast thou left to bairns o’ thine,The pauky knack,brewing ale amaist like wine.That gar’d us crack ?ae brawly did a pease-scon toast,iz i’ the quaff, and flee the frost,here we gat fu’ wi’ little cost,An’ muckle speed ;fow wae worth death, our sport’s a’ lost,Since Maggy’s dead.e summer night I was sae fu’,mang the riggs I gaed to spew,yne down on a green bank I trow,I took a nap,u’ sought a night balillilu.As soun’s a tap.n’ whan the dawn began to glow,hirsled up my dizzy pow,rae ’mang the corn like worry-kow,Wi’ banes fu’ sair,i’ kend nae mair than if a yow,How I came there.24Some said it was the pith o’ broom,That she stow’d in her masking loom,Which in our heads rais’d sic a foom.Or some wild seed,Which aft the chappen-stoup did toom.But fill’d our head.But now since ’tis sae that wo must,Not in the best ale put our trust.But when we’re auld return to dust,Without remead;Why should we tak’ it in disgust.Since Maggy’s dead.

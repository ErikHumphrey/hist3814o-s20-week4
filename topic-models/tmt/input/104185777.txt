;But the owner’s heart was hard as stane,And his Lady’s was harder still I ween.They never gave alms to the poor,And they turned the wrethed f’rae their door,While the stranger as he passed their gate,Was by the wander and tykes beset.Oh there lived there ane bonny May,Mild and sweet as the morning ray,Or the gloamin’ o’ a summer’s day:Her hair was fair, her een were blue,And the dimples o’ love played round hersweet mou,Her waist was sae jimp and her ankle sae sma,Her bosom as white as the new driven snaSprent o’er the twin mountains o’ sweet Ca-tefthun,Beaming mild in the rays of a wintery sun.Where the print of a foot has never been,And not a cloud in the lift is seen ;When the wind is slumbering in its cave,And the bark is sleeping on the wave,4And the breast of the ocean is as stillAs the morning’ mist upon Morven Hill.Oil sair did she rue baitli night and day,Her hap was to be this Lady’s May.Ae morning a minstrel, aged and poor,Came liarping to this Ha-house door;His heart seemed light, though his head was 'bare,And spairlie coverit wi‘ thin white hair;His beard adovvn his bosom fellStreaming like snow in a wintery gale.Sae sweet and blythesome was his lay,The gowd spink danced upon the spray ;The lint-white chirpt frae the bush,And sweetly sang the lark and the thrush;While decked in green the fairy crewDanced frae the grass the morning dewFor the daemons of night had taken their flightAs soon as they saw the morning light,And the ghaists had left the dreary yew;Oh they trippit sae lightly over the lea,Their doublets were green as green might be,And thev shone in the sun like the Spanishflee.And aye the Minstrel harpet and sang,Till his notes through ilka chamber rang;Though decrepit, forlorn, and raggid was he,There was merghe in his fingers and fire inhis e‘e.5Though his voice it was broken and trem-belled fu‘ sore,He sung Caledonia's battles of yore ;Her mountains sae wild and her sweet smil¬ing plains,And the graces and loves of her nymphs andher swains.He brushed the wire wi’ muckle glee;He lilted his notes right merily,As if nae dolour he might dree.The Lady of Dun she rang her bell—,What noise is this, pray quickly tell;What means this lilting and deray ?A bonny-like rippet this, by my fay,.A Minstrel, madam, aged and poor,Quoth the damsel, is harping at the door;And oh, my Lady, I’m wae to see him,And wish I had only something to gi’e him,For his doublet is ragid his hewit is bare,And the wind whistles through his thin whitehair;Albeit his lays be blythesomecand sweet,He hasna a bachel to cover his feet.“ Harping at this time of the morn,Upon my life it canna be borne ;Y e manseless woman, gae tell my menTo fling the catyff o’er the den,And let him perish in the deep,For raising the lady o’ Dun frae her sleep.'16iSThe damsell looked sae wae and sae meek,And the peaid of pity stood clear on eachcheek,Shall 1 tell him my lady to wend o’er thelea,And he winna come hack for bountith or fee,The silly auld carle, may peace gae wi’ him,Tin sure, dear lady, this time you'll forgiehim,“Her voice was sae sweet, and she bended herknee,And the moisture o' truth dimmed her bonnyblue e’e,Which glissent like the sun thrugh a cloudin June,Or the milder radience of the moon,As she rides in the heavens all alone,And the thin mists of summer sail round herthrone.An angel frae heaven might hae kissed thatsweet face,And returned to heaven all pure from theembrace.—Swithe, out of my presence, ye heard whatj said,”Quoth the lady, “ ’Tis meet my behests beobeyed.”The men they had danced to the minstrel’slay,But ready their lady’s behests to obey—Time flechin, sinfu’, murtherous men,They flang the harper o’er the den,And loot him perish in the deep,For raising the lady o’ Dun frae her sleep.He prigget for mercy, he prayed for grace,While the tears run down his aged face.He vowed to heaven he meant nae offence,And beggit the men to let him gae hence—To hirple his was to the cot house door,And cheer wi’ his lays the simple and poor;For though his comforts here were but few,His bosom beat to nature true,Nae mercy here, quoth the men can be given,But we hope, auld man, you’ll meet it inheaven,Our lady’s behests we are bound to obey,Albert we hae danced to your roundelay,Then strick on your harp the last sound ofwoe,Before that you sleep in your cauld bed below'.The Laird o’ Dun hath power of the law,The Minstrel was flung in harp an a’The Minstrel he groaned and his harp it rungAnd mute for aye was his tunefu’ tongue.A w'aesome sight it was to see,Him lunched sae quick to eternity.Ance kythit o’er the stream his beard saehoare—Syne his spirit winged its way to gloar,And never mair was that minstrel seen;But aye and anon, at morn and een,His harp it sounded to the breeze,And his figure was seen to gilde through thetrees,And groans were heard sae loud and sae deep8Tlie lady o’ Dun could never mair sleep;But aye the moment she winket an e’e,She sam before her as plain as might be,The Minstrel wide gapin and wreathin inpain,And sueing for mercy he couldna obtain,And wringing bis hands in wild despair,And waggin his head and his thin white hair,While vieve in her fancy wad she see,The ghai«tly glower of his death-set e’e,And his clay cold hand wad press her cheek ;Oh then wad she start frae her bed and shriek‘‘ Hand aff that hand ! oh, withdraw that e’e,For heaven’s sake, take him away frae me!His heard seems smeared over with feame,Oh, 1 wish it were hut it’s nae—a dream !For he looks sae wildly in my faceThat I wish to God he had met wi‘ grace !Lord send to my soul the balsdm of peace!Oh, when shall 1 find it? Never, never IIt has fled this bosom for ever and ever I”9MARY, THE MATH OF THE INN.AVho is she, the poor maniac, whose wildly fixed eyes,Seem a heart overcharged to express?She weeps not, yet often and deeply she sighs;She never complains—but her silence impliesThe composure of settled distress.No aid, no compassion the maniac will seek,Cold and hunger a" ake not her care;Thro’ the rags do the winds of winter blow bleakOn her poor wither’d bosom, half bare, and her cheekHas the deadly pale hue of despair.Yet cheerful and happy (nor distant the day),Poor Mary, the maniac, has been;The traveller remembers, who journey’d this way.No damsel so lovely, no damsel so gay,As Mary the maid of the Inn.Her cheerful address fill’d the guests with delight,As she welcom’d them in with a smile;Her heart was a stranger to childish affright.And Mary would walk by the abbey at night,When the wind whistled down the dark aisle.She lov’d— and young Richard had settled the day,And she hop’d to be happy for life ;But Richard was was idle and worthless; and theyWho knew him, would pity poor Mary, and say,That she was too good for his wife.’Twas in autumn, and stormy and dark was the night,And fast were the windows and door;’Two guests sat enjoying the fire that burnt’brightAnd smoking in silence with tranquil delight.They listened to hear the wind roar.10’Tis pleasant, cries one, seated by the fire-side.To hear the wind whistle without.A fine night for the abbey his comrade replied,Methinks a man’s courage would now be well triedWho would wander the ruins about.I’ll wager a dinner, the other one cried,That Mary would venture there now.Then wager then lose, with a sneer he replied,I’ll warrant she’d fancy a ghost by her side,And faint if she saw a white cow.Will Mary this charge on her courage allow ?His companion exclaimed with a smile.I shall win’ for I know she will venture there now ;And earn a new bonnet by bringing a boughFrom the alder that grows in the aisle.With fearless good humour did Mary comply.And her way to the abbey she bent;The night it was gloomy, the wind it was high.And as hollowly howling it swept through the sky.She shiver’d with cold as she went.O’er the path so well known still proceeded the maid.Where the abbey rose dim on the sight;Through the gateway she entered, she felt not afraidYet the ruins were lonely and wild, and the shadeSeemed to darken the gloom of the night.All around her was silent, save when the rude blastHowl’d dismally round the whole pile;Over wood-covered fragments still fearless she pass’dAnd arrived at the innermost ruins at last,Where the alder tree grows in the isle.Well pleased did she reach it, and quickly drew near,And hastily gathered the bough,When the sound of a voice seemed to rise on her ear,She paused and she listened, all eager to hear.And her heart panted fearfully now.11The wind blew, the hoarse ivy shook over her head;She listen’d nought else could she hear;The wind ceased, her heart sunk in her bosom with dreadFor she heard in the ruins, distinctly, the treadOf footsteps approaching her near.Behind a white column half breathless with fear.She crept to conceal herself there ;That instant the moon o’er a dark cloud shone clear,And she saw in the moondight two ruffians appear,And between them a corpse did they bear.Then Mary could feel her heart’s blood curdle cold :Again the rough wind hurried by;—It blew off the hat o f the one, ami, behold ;Even close to the feet of poor Mary it roll’d ;She fell—and expected to die.Curse the hat, he exclaims, Nay come on, and first hideThe dead body,’ his comrade replied,She beheld him in safety pass on by her side,Then sezies the hat, fear her courage supplied,And away through the abbey she flies.She ran with wild speed, she rush’d in at the door.She cast her eyes horribly round;Her limbs could support her faint body no more.But exhausted and breathless she sank on the floor.Unable to utter a sound.Ere yet her pale lips could the story impart,For a moment the hat met her view;Her eyes from the object convulsively start—F’or O God, what cold horror thrill’d through her heartWhen the name of her Richard she knew.Where the old abbey stands, on the common hard by,His gibbet is now to be seen;Not far from the inn it engages the eye,The traveller beholds it, and thinks, with a sigh,Of poor Mary the Maid of the Inn.12THEUMMY CAP.A TALE.In ancient times, far i’ the north,A hundred miles ayont the forth,Upon a stormy winter day,Twa men forgather’d o’ the way,Ane was a sturdy bardoch chielAn’ frae the wether happit weel,Wi’ a mill’d plaiding jockey-coatAnd eke he on his head had gotA thrummy cap baith large and stout,Wi’ flaps ahind, as weel’s a snout,Whilk button’d close aneath his chin,To keep the cauld frae getting in jUpon his legs he had gammashesWhilk sodgers term their spatterdashesAn’ on his hands instead o’ gloves,Large doddy mittens, whilk he'd rooseFor warmness, an* an aiken stickNae verralang, but unco thick,Intill his nieve—he dravo awa’,But car'd for neither frost nor snaw,The ither was just the reverse,O' claes and courage baith was scarce,Sae in our tale, as we go on,I think we'll ca* him cow'rldy John.Sae on they gade at a gude scow’r,’ Cause that they saw a gath’ring shower,13Grow verra thick upon the wind,Whilk to their wae they soon did find .A mighty show’r o’ snaw and drift,As ever dang down frae the lift!Right wild and boist’rons Boreas roar’d,Preserves L quoth John, we 11 haith be smor’d.Our trystic end we’ll ne’er make out;Chear up, says Thrummy, never dout.But I’m some fly’d we’ve tint our way,Howe’er at the neist house we’ll stay.Until we see gif it grow fair,Gin no, a’ night we’ll tarry there.Weel, weel, says Johnny, we shall try,Syne they a mansion house did spy,Upo’ the road a piece afore,Sae up they gade unto the door,When Thrummy chappit wi’ his stick,Syne to the door, came verra quick,A meikle dog, wha barked sair,But Thrummy for him didna care;He handled weel bis aiken staff,An’ spite o’s teeth he kept him affUntil the Landlord came to see,And ken fat might the matter be ;Then verra soon the dog did ceaseThe Landlord then did spear the caseQuoth Thrummy, Sir, we ha’e gane rill ;We thought we’d ne’er a house get till,We near were smor'd amo’ the drift,And sae, gudeman, ye’ll mak’ a shiftTo gi’e us quarters a’ this night,For now we dinna ha’e the light,Farer to gang, tho’ it were fair,See gin ye hae a bed to spare,14Whate’er ye charge we canna grudge,But satisfy ye, ere we budgeTo gang awa’—and fan ’tis day,We’ll pack out all, and tak the way.The Landlord said, o‘ beds I’ve nane,Our ain fowks they will scarce contain,-But gin ye’ll gang but twa miles foretAside the fcirk dwalls Robbe Dorret,Wha keeps a Change-house, sells guide drink,His house ye may rnak out I think.Quoth Thrurnmy, that’s owre far awa’,The roads are sae blawn up wi’ snaw,To mak it is na in our power ;For, look ye, there's a gathering showerJust coining on—you’ll let us bide,Tho’ we should sit by the fire side.The Landlord said to him, Na, na,I canna let you bide ava,Chap aff, for ’tis na worth your w’hileTo bide, when ye hae scrimp twa mileTo gang—sae quickly aff you‘11 steer,For faith, I doubt ye’ll na be here.Twa mile! quo’ Thrummy, deil speed me.If frae your house this night I jee,Are we to starve in Christian land ?As lang's my stick bides in my hand,An’ siller plenty in my pouch,To nane about your house I'll crouch,Landlord, ye needna be sae rude,For faith wre’ll mak our quarters good.Come, John, let's in, we’ll tak a sate,Fat sorrow'gars you look so blate?Sae in he gangs, and sets him down,Says he, there's nae about your towm.J5/ -/Sail put me out till a new day,Lang as I‘ve siller for to pay,The Landlord said, Ye‘re rather rash,To turn you out I canna fas'^Since ye‘re so positive to bide,But troth yese sit by the fire-side ;I tald ye else of beds [‘ve nane,Unoccupied, except bare ane-;In it, 1 fear, ye winna ly ;For stoutest heart has aft been shyTo venture in within the room,After the night begins to gloom ;For in it they can ne'er get rest,Tis haunted by a frightful gliaist:Oursels are terrified a.‘ night,Sae ye may chance to get a sight,Like that which some o‘our fowk saw, •Far better till ye gang awa‘,Or else ye’ll may be rue the day,Guide faith quo‘ John, I‘m thinking sae ;Better into the neuk to sit,Than ila’d, Guide keep's out o‘ our wit;Preserve us ever frae all evil,I widna like to see the devel!Whisht gowk.quo’Thrummy,baud your peace1 hat sauna gar me quit this place ;Nor great norsma I ne’er did ill,The ghaist nor deil my rest shall spill.I will defy the meikle deil,And a’ his warks I wat fu’ weel;What the sorrow then maks you sae erry?Fling by your fears, and come be cherry,Landlord gin ye‘ll mak up that bed,I promise I'll be verra glad,16Within the same a' night to lie,If that the room be warm and dry,The Landlord says. Ye’se get a fire,And candle too gin ye desire,Wi’ beaks to read; and for your bed,I’ll orders gie, to get it made.John says, as I’m a Christian man,Who never likes to curse nor ban.Nor steal, nor lie, nor drink, nor roar,I’ll never gang within its door,But sit hy the fireside a’ night,And gang awa’ where’er ’tis light.Says Thrummy till him, wi’ a glow’r.Ye cowardly gowk I’ll mak ye cow’r;Come up the stair alang wi’ me,And I shall caution for ye be.Then Johnny faintly gaed consent,Sine up the stairs to tiie bed they went,Where soon they gat baith fire and light^To had them harty a’ the night;The Landlord likwise gae them meat;Meikle as they baith could eat;Show’d them their bed and bade them gangTo it whene’er they did think lang;Sae wishing them a gude repose,Straight s-yne to his ain bed he goes.Our travellers now being left alane,’Cause that the frost was nipping keen,Coost aff their shoon and warmed their feet,Then syne gaed to their bed to sleep.But cowardly John wi’ fear was quaking;He coudna sleep but still lay waking,Sae troubled wi' nis panic fright,When near the twalt hour o’ night,17Tiiat Thrummy waked and thus spoke,Preserve’s quoth he, I'm like to chockWi’ thirst, and l maun hae a drink.I will pang down the stair, I think,And grapple for the water-pail,0 fora waught o‘ caller ale !Johnny grips till him, and says, Na,1 winna let you gang awa ;Wow will you gang and leave me hereAlane to oie wi’ perfect fear ?Rise up and gae wi' me then, quoth Thrummy,Ye senseless gude-for-naething bummy,I’m only gaen to seek some water,I will be back just in a clatter,Na, na says John I’ll rather lie,But as I’m likewise something dry,Gif ye can get a jug or cap,Fesh up to me a little drap.Ay ay quoth Thrummy that I willAlthough I shouldnaget a gill,Sae down he goes to seek a drink,But then he sees a little blinkO’ light that shone upon the floor,Out through the lock-hole o’ the door,Which .wasna fast but stood a-gee,Whatever’s there he thinks he’ll see :Sae baldly o'er the threshold ventures,Then irt within the door he enters.But reader judge of the surpriseThat there he saw with wondering eyesA spacious vault well stored wi’ casksO' reaming ale and some big flasks,And stride-legs o’er a cask o’ aleHe saw the likeness of himsel.ISJust in the dress that he east aff,A thrummy and an aiken staff,Gammashes and the jockey coat ;And in its hand the Ghaist had got -A big four-legged timber bicker,Fill'd to tbe brim wi' nappy liquor,Our hero at tbe spectre stared,But neither daunted was not car’d,But to the Ghaist straight up did step,An’ says dear brother Thrummy Cap,The waist ye surely dinna drink,So I wi‘ you will taste I think ;Syne took a jug, pou’d out the pail,And fill’d it up wi’ the same ale,Frae under where the spectre sat,And then up stairs wit it he gat ;Took a"gude drink, gae John anither,But never tald him o’ his his britherThat he inta the cellar sawMair than he’d naething seen ava,Light brown and nappy was the beerAY bar did you get it? John did speir,Says Thrummy, sure ye needna care,I’ll gae and try and get some mair,Sae down the stair again he goes.To get o’ drink anither dozeBeing positive to hae.some mairBut still he faund the Ghaist was there,Now on a butt behind the door:Says he, ye didna ill;before,Dear brother Thrummy, sae I’ll tryYou once again because I‘m dry.He fills his jug straight out belo w,An’ up the stair again does go.John marvelled sair, but didna speirAgain where did he get the beer,For it was stronger than the first,Syne they baith drank till like to burst,Syne did compose tbemsels to rest,To sleep a while they thought it best.One hour in bed they hadna been,They scarcely weel had closed their een,When just into the neighbouring cham’erThey heard a dreadfu’ din and clamour.Beneath the hed claes John did cow r,But Thrummy jump’d upon the floor,Him by the sark fail John did baud ;Lye still, quoth he, fat, are ye mad?Thrummy then gaed a hasty jump,Syne took John on the ribs a thump,That made him quickly to lie down,In little better than a swoon,While Thi ummy fast as he could rin,Sets aff to see what made the din.The chamber seem’d to him as light,Gif as the sun was shining bright,Tne Ghaist was stanen at the door ,In the same dress he had afore ;And o'er anent it, at the wa’,Were ither apparitions tvva.Thrummy beheld them for a-weeBut deil a wmrd as yet spake he.The spirits seeme'd to kick a ba’,The Ghaist against the other t,wa ;Whilk close they drave baith back and foAtween the chimney and the door.He stops a while and sees the play.Syne, rinnin up, he this did say,20Ane for ane may wee! compnie,Bu/ twa for ane is rather sair ;The play’s nae equal, say I vow,Dear brother Thrummy, I'll help you.Then wi’ his fit he kicked the ha’,Gard it play stot against the wa’;Quick then, as lightning, fra the sky,The spectres with a horyid cry,A‘ vanished in a clap o‘ thun'er.While Thrummy at the same did Won’erThe room was quiet now and dark,An’ Thrummy striping in his sark ;Glauming the gate back to his bed,He thinks he hears a person tread,An’ ere he gat without the door,The Ghaist again stood him before,And in his face did staring stand,Wi’a big candle in its hand.Quoth Thrummy, Friend, I want to knowWhat brings you frae the shades below,I in goodness’ name commandYou tell your story just aff hand?Fat wad ye hae?—I’ll do my bestFor you, to let you be at rest,Then says the Ghaist, ’Tis thirty yearSinse Tve been doom’d to wander here ;In all that time there has been noneBehaved sae bold as ye have doneSae if you’ll do a job for me,Disturbance mair I'll never gie.Sae on your tale, quoth ThrummyTo do ye justice sure will try.Then mark me weel, the Ghaist repliedAnd ye shall soon be sati-fied :21Frae this aback near forty year,I of this place was overseer,When this Laird’s father had the land,A’ thing was then at my command,W i' power to do as I thought fit,In ilka cau<e I chief did sit:The Laird paid great respect for me ,Bet I an ill return did gie,The title-Deeds of his EstateOut of the same I did him cheat,And stale them frea whare they did lieSome days before the Laird did dieHis son at that time was in France,And sae I thought I’d hae a chance,Gif he su l never come again,That the Estate would be my ain.But scarcely three bare weeks were past,When death did come and grip me fast,Sae sudden that 1 hadua pow’rThe charter back for to restore,Soon after that hame came the heir,And syne got up the reefu rair,What sorrow was come o’ the Rights?They sought them several days and nightsBut never yet hae they been seen,As I aneath a muckle staneDid hide them i’ this cham’er wa’,Weel sew’d up in a leather ba’;But I was ne’er allowed to restUntill that I the same confest;But this to do I hadna power,Frae yon time to this verra hourThat I’ve revealed it a to you,And now I’ll tell you what to do.22V/Till nae langsyne nae rnony kent,That this same laiidthe rights did want;But now they haediim at the law,And the neist week the laird maun shaw ;Before the court theTights o!

O’ beds I’ve nane,Our ain fovvks they will scarce contain ;But gin ye’ll gang hut twa miles forretAside the Kirk dvvalls Robbie Dorret,Wha keeps a Change-house, sells guid drink.His house ye may mak out I think.Quoth Thrummy, that’s owre far awa’,Ihe roads are sae blawn up wi’ snaw.To mak it is na in our power;For, look ye, there’s a gathering showerJust coming on—you’ll let us hide,Tho’ we should sit by the fire side.The Landlord said to him, Na, na,I canna let you hide ava.Chap aff, for ’tis na worth your whileTo hide, when ye hae scrimpt twa mileTo gang—sae quickly aff you’ll steer.For faith, I doubt ye’ll na he here.Twa mile ! quo’ Thrummy, deil speed me.If frae your house this night I jee ;Are we to starve in Christian land ?As lang’s my stick hides in my hand.An’ siller plenty in my pouch.To nane about your house I’ll crouch.Landlord, ye needna he sae rude.Fop faith we’ll mak our quarters good.Come, John, let’s in, we’ll tak a sate.Fat sorrow gars you look so hlate ?Sae in he gangs, and sets him down.Says he, there’s nae about your town.6Sail put me out till a new day.As lang’s I’ve siller for to pay.The Landlord said. Ye’re rather rash,To turn you out I cauna fash.Since ye’re so positive to hide.But troth yese sit hy the fire-side ;I tald ye else of beds I’ve nane.Unoccupied, except hare ane ;In it, I fear, ye winna ly ;For stoutest hearts has aft been shyTo venture in within the room.After the night begins to gloom ;For in it they can ne’er get rest,’Tis haunted by a frightful ghaist ;Oursels are terrified a’ night,Sae ye may chance to get a sight.Like that which some o’ our fowk saw.Far better still ye gang awa’.Or else ye'll maybe rue the day.Guide faith quo’ John, I’m thinking sae ;Better into the neuk to sit.Than fla’d, Gude keep’s, out o’ our wit ;Preserve us ever frae all evil,I wadna like to see the devil !Whisht gowk, quo’ Thrummy, hand your peaThat sanna gar me quit this place ;Nor great nor sma’ I ne’er did ill.The ghaist nor deil my rest shall spill.1 will defy the meikle deil.And a’ his warks I wat fu’ weel ;What the sorrow then maks you sae eery ?Fling by your fears, and come be cheery,I .and lord gin ye’ll mak up that bed,I promise I’ll be verra glad,7Within the same a’ night to lie,If that the room he warm and dry.The Landlord says, Ye’se get a fire,And candle too gin ye desire,Wi’ heuks to read ; and for your hed,I’ll orders, gie to get it made.John says, as I’m a Christian man,Who never likes to curse nor ban.Nor steal, nor lie, nor drink, nor whore,I’ll never gang -within its door.But sit by the fireside a’ night.And gang awa’ whene’er ’tis light.Says Thrummy till him, wi’ a glow’r,Ye cowardly gowk I’ll mak ye cow’r;Come up the stair alang wi’ me.And I shall caution for ye be.Then Johnny faintly gaed consent.And up the stairs to the room they went,Where soon they gat baith fire and light.To baud them hearty a’ the night;The Landlord likewise gae them meat;As meikle as they haith could eat;Shew’d them their hed and hade them gangTo it, whene’er they did think lang ;Sae wishing them a gude reposeStraight syne to his ain hed he goesOur trav’llers now being left alane,’Cause that the frost was nipping keen,Coost aff their shoon, aud warm’d their feet.And syne gaed to their hed to sleep.But cowardly John wi’ fear was quaking.He coudna sleep hut still lay waking,Sae troubled with his panic fright,W hen near the twalt hour o’ night.8That Thnimmy waken’d, and thus spoke,Preserve’s ! quoth he, I’m like to choakWi* thirst, and I maun hae a drink;I will gang down the stair, I think,.And grapple for the water-pail,0 for a waught o’ caller ale !Johnny grips till him, and says, Na,1 winna let you gang awa’:Wow will ye gang and leave me hereAlane, to die wi’ perfect fear ?Rise an’ gae wi’ me then, quoth Thrummy,Ye senseless glide for naething bummy,I’m only gaen to seek some waterI will he back just in a clatter.Na, na, says John, I’ll rather lye,But as I’m likewise something dryGif ye can get jug or cap,Fesh up to me a little drap.Ay, ay, quo’ Thrummy that I will,Altho’ ye sudna get a gill.Sae down he gaes to seek a drink,And then he sees a blinkO’ light, that shone upo’ the floor,Out thro’ the lock-hole o’ the door,Which was na fast, but stood a-jee;Whatever’s there he thinks he’ll see:So bauldly o’er the threshold ventures,And in within the door he enters.But, Reader, judge of the surprise,When there he saw, with worn!’ring eyes,A spacious vault well stor’d wi’ casksO’ reaming ale, and some big flasks.An’ stride-legs o’er a cask o’ ale.He saw the likeness o’ himsel.9Just in the dress that he const aff,A thrummy and an aiken staff,Gammashes and the jockey-coat;And in its hand the Ghaist had gotA big four-legged timber bicker,Fill’d to the brim wi’ nappy liquor,Our hero at the spectre stared.But neither daunted was nor car’d.But to the Ghaist stright up did step,An’ says, dear brother, Thrummy Cap,The warst ye surely dinna drink,So I wi’ you will taste I think;Syne took a jug, pou’d out the pail,And fill’d it up wi’ the same ale,Frae under where the spectre sat.And up the stair wi’ it he gat;Took a gude drink, gae John anither,But never tald him o’ his brither-.That he into the cellar saw,Mair than he’d naething seen ava.Light brown and nappy was the beer:Whar did you get it ? John did speir.Says Thrummy, sure ye needna care,I’ll gae and try to get some mair,Sae down the stair again he goes.To get o’ drink anither dose.Being positive to hae some mair;But still he fand the Ghaist was there.Now on a butt behind the door:Says he, ye didna ill before.Dear brother Thrummy, sae I’ll tryYou ance again, because I’m dry.He fills his jug stright out below.An’ up the stair again does go.10John marvelled sair, but didna speirAgain where he did get the beer.For it was stronger than the first,Sae they baith drank till like to burst.Syne did compose themsels to rest.To sleep a while they thought it best.An hour in bed they hadna been.And scarcely weel had clos’d their e en.Whan just into the neighbouring cham'er.They heard a dreadfu’ din and clamour.Beneath the bed-claes John did cow’r.But Thrummy jumpt upon the floor.Him by the sark-tail John did baud ;Lye still, quoth he, fat, are ye mad ?Thrummy then gaed a hasty jump,And took John on the ribs a thump.Till on the bed he tumbled down.In little better than a swoon,While Thrummy fast as he could rin,Set aff to see what made the din.The chamber seem’d to him as light.As gif the sun were shining bright;The Ghaist was stanen at the door.In the same dress he had afore ;And o’er anent it, at the we.’,ATere ither apparitions twa.Ihrummy beheld them for a-wee.But deil a word as yet spake he:The spirits seem’d to kick a ba’,1 he Ghaist against the other twa;Whilk close they drave baith back and fore,A tween the chimney and the door.He stops a while and sees the play.Syne, rinnin up, he this did say.11Arve for ane may weel compare.But twa for ane is rather sair ;The play’s nae equal, say I vow,Dear brother Thrummy, I’ll help you.Then wi’ his fit he kicked the ba’,Gard it play slot against the wa’;Quick then, as lightning frae the sky,The spectres with a horrid cry,A’ vanished in a clap o’ thun’er,While Thrummy at the same did won’er.The room was quiet now and dark.An’ Thrummy striping in his sark;Glauming the gate back to his bed,He thinks he hears a parson tread.An’ ere he gat without the door,The Ghaist again stood him before.And in his face did staring stand,Wi’ a big candle in its hand.Quoth Thrummy, Friend, I want to knowWhat brings you frae the shades below,I in my Maker’s name commandYou tell your story just aff hand ?Fat wad ye hae ?—I’ll do my bestFor you, to let you be at rest.Then says the Ghaist, ’ Tis thirty vp.nrSince I’ve been doom’d to wander here;In all that time there has been noneBehav’d sae bold as ye have done;Sae if you’ll do a job for me.Disturbance mair I’ll never gie.Sae on your tale, quoth Thrummy.To do you justice sure will try.Then mark me weel, the Ghaist replied.And ye shall soon be satisfied:12Frae this ahacK near forty year,I of this place was overseer.When this Laird’s father had the land,A' thing was then at my command,Wi’ power to do as I thought fit,In ilka cause I chief did sit:The Laird paid great respect for me.But I an ill return did gie ;The Title-Deeds of his EstateOut of the same I did him cheat,And stale them frae whare they did lie,Some days before the Laird did die.His son at that time was in France,And sae I thought I’d hae a chance.Gif he sud never come again,That the Estate would he my ain.But scarcely three hare weeks were past.When death did come and grip me fast,Sae sudden that I hadna pow’rThe charter back for to restore,Soon after that hame came the heir.And syne got up the reefu’ rair,What sorrow was come o’ the Rights PThey sought them several days and nightsBut never yet hae they been seen.As I aneath a muckle stane.Did hide them i’ this chanver \va’,Weel sew’d up in a leather ha’ ;But I was ne’er allow’d to restUntil that I the same confest;But this to do I hadna power,Frae yon time to this verra hour.That I’ve reveal’d it a’ to you ;And now I’ll tell you what to do.13Till nae langsyne nae mony kent.That this same Laird the Rights did want;But now they hae him at the law.And the neist owk the Laird maun shaw,Afore the court, the Rights o’s land,This puts him to an unco stand :For if he dinna shaw them there,O’ a’ his lands he'll he stript bare ;Nae hopes has he to save his ’state.This maks him sour and unco blate :He canna think whar’s Rights may be.And ne’er expects them mair to see.But now, my friend, mark what I tell.And ye’ll get something to yoursel.Tak out the stane there in the wa’.And there ye’ll get the leather ba’,Tis just the same that you did see.When you said that you would help me;The Rights are sew’d up in its heart.But see you dinna wi’ them part.Until the laird shall pay you downJust fifty guineas and a crown,Whilk at my death was due to me.This for thy trouble I’ll give thee;And I’ll disturb this house nae mair,’Cause I’ll be free from all my care.This Thrummy promised to do.And syne the Ghaist bid him adieuAnd vanish’d with a pleasant soundDown thro’ the laft and thro’ the ground.Thrummy gaed back syne to his bed.And cowardly John was verra glad.That he his neighbour saw ance mair.For of his life he did despair.14Wow man, qno’ John, whare hae you LeenfCome tell me a’ fat ye hae seen,Na, bide, says Thrmnmy, till day-light,And syne 111 tell you hale and right.Sae baith lay still and took a nap.Until the ninth hour it did chap.Thrummy syne raise, pnt on his claes.And to the chamber quick he gaes,Taks out the stane into the wa’.And soon he found the leathern ba’ ;Took out the Rights, replac’d the stane,Ere John did ken vvhar he had been:Then baith came slapping down the stair,The morning now was calm and fair.Weel, says the Laird, my trusty frien’,Hae ye ought in our chamber seen ?Quoth Thrummy, Sir, I naething sawThat did me ony ill ava.Weel, quoth the Laird, ye now may gang,Ye ken the day’s na verra lang;In the mean time its calm and clear.Ye lose your time in biding here.Quoth Thrummy, Sir, mind what I tell,I’ve mair right here than you yoursel.Sae till I like I here shall bide,The Laird at this began to chide:Says he, My friend, you’re turning rude.Quoth Thrummy, I’ll my claim make good.For here I just before you a’.The Rights o’ this Estate can shaw.And that is mair then ye can do.What! quo’ the Laird, can that be true ?’Tis true, quoth Thrummy, look and see,U’ye think that I would tell a lie.] 5The Parchments frae his poach then drew.And down upon the table threw.The Laird at this up to him ran.And cried, Whar did you get them, man ?Syne Thrummy tald him a’ the tale.As I’ve tald you, baith clear and hale.The Laird at this was fidgin fain,That he had gat his Rights again:And fifty guineas down did tell.Besides a present frae himsel.Thrummy thanked him, an’ syne his gowdIntil a muckle purse he stow’d.And cramm’d it in his oxter-pouch.And syne sought out his aiken crutcli:And, fare-ye-weel, I maun awa,And see gin I get thro’ the sna’ ;Weel, fare-ye-weel, replied the Laird;But how comes it ye hanna’ shar’dOr gien your neihor o’ the money ?Na, by my saul, I Sir, quo’ Thrummy,When I the siller, Sir, did win,(To ha’e done this wad he a sin,)Before that I the Ghaist had laid.The nasty beast had  the bed.And sae my tale I here do end,I hope no one it will offend:My muse will na assist me langer.The dorty jade sometimes does anger,I thought her ance a gay smart lass.But now she’s come to sic a pass.That a’ my cudgeling and wheeping.Will hardly wake her out o’ sleeping;To plague her mair I winna try,But dight my pen and lay it by.i asCOMIC TALEOFMARGARET and the MINISTER.A douse, religious, Idntry wife.That liv’d a quiet contented life,To show respect unto

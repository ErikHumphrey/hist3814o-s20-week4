I.King'Henry VIII. used to visit theWatches in the City, and how he becameacquainted with a merry jovial Cobler.It was the custom of King Henrythe Eighth to walk late in the nightinto the city disguised, to observe andtake notice how the constables andwatch performed their duty, not onlyin guarding the city gates, but also indiligently watching the inner parts ofthe city, that so they might, in a greatmeasure, prevent those disturbancesand casualties which too often happenin great and populous cities in thenight; and this he did oftentimes,3without the least discovery who he was,returning home to Whitehall early inthe morning.Now on his return home throughthe Strand, he took notice of a certaincobler, who was constantly up at work,whistling and singing every morning.The king was resolved to see him, andbe acquainted with him, in order towhich he immediately knocks the heeloffhis shoe by hitting it against a stone,and having so done, he bounced at thecobler’s stall.Who’s there ? cries the cobler.Here’s one, cries the king. Withthat the cobler opened the stall door,and the king asked him if he could putthe heel on his shoe.Yes, that I can, says the cobler :Come in, honest fellow, and sit theedown by me, and I will do it for theestraight, the robler scraping his awls4and old shoes to one side, to makeroom for the king to sit down.The king being hardly able to forbearlaughing at the kindness of the cobler,asked him if there was not a househard by that sold a cup of ale, and thepeople up ?Yes, said the cobler, there is an innover the way, where I believe the folksare up, for the carriers go from thencevery early in the morning.With that the king borrowed an oldshoe of the cobler, and went over tothe inn, desiring the cobler would bringhis shoe to him thither as soon as hehad put on the heel again. The coblerpromised he would; so making whathaste he could to put on the heel, hecarries it over to the king, saying, hon¬est blade, here is thy shoe again, and Iwarrant thee it will not come off insuch a haste.5Very well, says the king, what must;you have for your pains ?A couple of pence, replied the colder.UWell, said the king, seeing thou art; an honest merry fellow, here is a teas-i ter for thee ; come, sit down by me, Iwill drink a full pot with thee ; come,here’s a good health to the king.With all my heart, said the cobler,I’ll pledge thee were it in water.So the cobler sat down by the kingand was very merry, and drank off hisliquor very freely ; he likewise sungsome of his merry songs and catches,whereat the king laughed heartily, andwas very jocund and pleasant with thecobler, telling him withal that his namewas Harry Tudor, that he belonged tothe court, and that if he would comeand see him there, he would makehim very welcome, because he was amerry companion, and charged him not6to target his name, and to ask any onefor him about the court, and they wouldsoon bring him to him; for, said theking, I am very well known there.Now the cobler little dreamt that hewas the king that spake to him, muchless, that the king’s name was HarryTudor. Therefore, with a great dealof confidence he stands up, and puts offhis hat, makes two or three scrapeswith his foot, and gives the king manythanks, also felling him, that he wasone of the most honest fellows he evermet with in all his life-time, and al¬though he never had been at court, yethe should not be long before he wouldmake a holiday to come and see him.Whereupon the king, paying forwhat they had drunk, would'have takenhis leav^e of the cobler ; but he, not be¬ing willing to part with him, took holdof his Hand, and said, By my faith youmust not go, you shall not go, you shallfirst go and see my poor habitation, I7 ;have there a tub of good brown ale thatwas never tapped yet, and you must goand taste it, for you are the most hon¬est blade I ever met withal, and I lovean honest merry companion with allmy heart.CHAP. II.How the Cohler entertained the King inhis Cellar, and of the disturbance theyhad like to have had by his wife Joan.IiSo the cobler took the King withhim over the way, where he had his cel¬lar adjoining the stall, which was hand¬somely and neatly furnished for a manof his profession. Into the cellar hetook the king ; there, said he, sit down,you are welcome,' hut I must desireyou to speak softly, for fear of wakingmy wife Joan, who lies hard by, (shew¬ing the king a close bed made neatlyup at one corner of the cellar, much likea closet,) for if she should awake shewill make our ears ring again.8At which speech of the cobler’s theIdng laughed, and told him he wouldbe mindful and follow his directions.Whereupon the cobler kindled up a ^lire, and fetched out a brown loaf, fromwhich he cut a lusty toast, which he |sat baking at the fire ; then he brought |out his Cheshire cheese ; Now, says he, |there is as much fellowship in eatingas in drinking. ^Which made the King admire thehonest freedom of the cobler. So hav¬ing eaten a bit, the cobler began, Ahealth to all true hearts and merrycompanions ; at which the king smiled,saying, Friend, I’ll pledge thee.In this manner they eat and dranktogether till it was almost break ofday ; the cobler being very free of hisliquor, and delighting the King withseveral of his old stories, insomuchthat he was highly pleased with the ;manner of his entertainment; when9on a sudden, the cobler’s wife Joan be*gan to awake. I’faith, says the cobler,you must be gone, my wife Joan beginsto grumble, she’ll awake presently, andI would not for half the shoes in myshop she should find you here.Then taking the king by the hand,he led him up the stairs, saying, Fare¬well, honest friend, it shan’t be longbefore I mr.ke a holiday to come and1 see thee at court. , 7Thou shalt be kindly welcome, re-1, plied the king.So they parted, the king on his wayI to Whitehall, and the cobler to hiscellar, and there putting all things toi: rights before his wife Joan got up,he went to work again, whistling and> singing as merry as he used to be, being;ti much satisfied that he happened on sogood and jovial a companion, still pleas¬ing himself in his thoughts how merry> he should be when he came to court.CHAP. in.How the Cohler prepared himself to go toCourt, and how he was set out in the bestmanner by his wife Joan.Now as soon as the king came home,he sent out orders about the court,that if any one inquired for him bythe name of Harry Tudor, they shouldimmediately bring him before him,whatever he was, without any furtherexamination.The cobler thought every, day amonth till he had been at court to seehis new acquaintance, and was troub¬led how he should get leave of his wifeJoan, for he could not get without herknowledge, by reason he did resolve tomake himself as fine as he could, forhis wife always kept the keys of hisholiday clothes, whereupon one eve¬ning as they sat at supper, finding herin a very good humour, he began to layopen his mind to her, telling,her the11whole story of their acquaintance, re¬peating it over and over again, that hewas the most honest fellow that everhe met withal. Husband, quoth she,because you have been so ingenious to. tell me the whole truth, I will give; you leave to make a holiday for thisonce; you shall go to court, and Ii will make you as fine as I can.So it was agreed that he should go:| to court the next day; whereuponj, Joan rose betimes the next morning,ij to brush up her husband’s holidayi clothes, and made him as fine as sheii could. She washed and ironed thei lace-band, and made his ■ shoes shineI that he might see his face in them ;I having done this, she made her bus-|i band rise and pull off his shirt. ThenI she washed him with warm water fromI head to foot, putting on him a clean^ shirt; afterwards she dressed him in hist holiday clothes, pinning his laced bandin prim.12CHAP. IV.The Cobler's reception at Court, xcith themanner of his behaviour before the jKing.The Cobler being thus set forth, hestrutted through the streets like a crow 'in a gutter, thinking himself as fine as |the best of them all.In this manner be came to the court,staring on this body and that body !as he walked up and down, and notknowing who to ask for Harry Tudor.At last he espied one, as he thought, inthe habit of a servant man, to whomhe made this address, saying,Dost thou hear, honest fellow, do jyou know one Harry Tudor who be- jlongs to the court ?Yes, said the man, follow me, andI will bring you to him.With that he had him presently upi into the guard chamber, telling one ofthe yeomen of the guard there was oneI that inquired for Harry Tudor.Replied the yeoman ; I know himvery wrell; if you please to go alongwith me I’ll bring you to him immedi¬ately.SSo the colder followed the yeoman,admiring very much the prodigiousfinery of the rooms which he carriedI him through. He thought within him-1 self, that the yeoman was mistaken inI the person whom he inquired for ; for,said he, he whom I look for is a plain,merry, honest fellow, his name is Har¬ry Tudor ; we drank two pots togethernot long since. I suppose he may be¬long to some lord or other about thecourt.I tell you friend, replied the yeoman,! I know him very well, do you but fol-i low me, and I shall bring you to himI straight.14rSo going forward, he came into theroom where the king was, accompaniedby several of his nobles, who attendedhim.As soon as the yeoman had put upby the arras, he spoke aloud, May itplease your Majesty, here is one thatinquires for Harry Tudor.The cobler hearing this, thought hehad committed no less than treason :Therefore he up wuth his heels, and ranfor it; but not being acquainted withthe several turnings and rooms throughwhich he came, he was soon overtakenand brought before the king, whom thecobler little thought to be the personhe inquired after, therefore in a trem¬bling condition, he fell down on hisknees, saying,May it please your Grace, may itplease your Highness, I am a poor cob¬ler, who inquired for one Harry Tudor, iwho is a very honest fellow, 1 mended15the heel of his shoe not long since, andjfor which he paid me nobly, and gaveme two pots to boot: but I had himafterwards to my cellar, where we drank(part of a cup of nappy ale, and werevery merry, till my wife Joan beganto grumble, which put an end to ourimerriment for that time, but I told himI would come to the court and see him:assoon as conveniently I could.Well, said the king, don’t be trou-bled, do you know this honest fellow(again, if you could see him ?The cobler replied, Yes, that I do,(among a thousand.Then said the king, Stand, up, and be!not afraid, but look well nbout you,peradventure you may find - the fellowin this company.Whereupon the cobler arose* and"looked wishfully upon the king and therest of his nobles, but it was to little16or no purpose : for though he saw some¬thing in the king’s facej which hethought he had seen before, yet hecould not imagine him to be HarryTudor, whose heel of his shoe he hadmended, and who had been so merrywith him at the inn, and at his owncellar.He therefore told the king he didnot expect to find Harry Tudor a-mong such fine folks as he saw there,but that the person he looked for wasa plain, honest, and true hearted fellow.Adding withal, that he was sure thatdid Harry Tudor but know that he wascome to court, he would make him verywelcome : for, says the cobler, when weparted, he charged me to come to courtsoon and see him, which I promised Iwould, and accordingly I have made aholiday on purpose to have a glass w ithhim.At which speech of the coblers theking had much ado to forbear laughing17put, but keeping his countenance assteady as he could before the cobler,the spoke to the yeoman of the guard.Here, said he, take this honest cobleridown into my cellar, and let him drinkmy health; I will give orders thatHarry Tudor shall come to him pre-isently.So away ^iey went, the cobler beingfit to leap out of his skin for joy, notonly that he had come off' so well, butithat he should see his friend HarryIT udor.CHAP. V.i The Cobler's entertainment in the King'scellar.The cobler had not been long in theking’s cellar, before the king came tothim in the same habit that he had onwhen the cobler mended his shoe;iwhereupon the cobler knew him im-jl mediately, and ran and kissed him, say-Ung,18Honest Harry, I have made an holi¬day on purpose to see you, but I hadmuch ado to get leave of my wife Joan,who was loath to lose so much timefrom my work ; but I was resolved tosee you, and therefore I made myselfas fine as I could. But I’ll tell thee,Harry, when I came to court I was ina peck of troubles how to find you out:but at last I met with a man who toldme he knew you very wellf and that hewould bring me to you, but instead ofdoing so, he brought me before the km£,which" almost frightened me out of myseven senses; but faith I’m resolved tobe merry with you now, since I havemet you at last.Ay that we shall, replied the king, wewill be as merry as princes.Now after the cobler had drunk aboutfour or five good healths, he began tobe merry, and fell a-singing his old songsand catches, which pleased the kingv<Ay much, and made him laugh heartily.19When on a sudden, several of thelobles came into the cellar, extraordi-ary rich in apparrel, and all stood un-overed before Harry Tudor, which puthe cobler into great amazement atirst, but presently recovering himself,e looked more wishfully upon Harryudor, and soon knowing him to bebhe king whom he saw in the presencephamber, though in another habit, hemmediatelyJell upon his knees, saying,May it please your Grace, may itdease your Highness, I am a poor hon-ist cobler, and mean no harm.No, no, said the King, nor shall re-fceive any here, I assure you.He commanded him therefore to rise,,nd be as merry as he was before ; andhough he knew him to be the king,et he should use the same freedom withdm as he did before, when he mended[the heel of his shoe.I20This kind speech of the King’s, andthree or four glasses of wine, made thecobler be in as good humour as before,telling the king several of his old sto¬ries, and singing some of his best songs,very much to the satisfaction of the kingand all his nobles.THECOBLER S SONGIN THE.KING’S CELLAR.Come let us drink the other pot,Our sorrows to confound ;We’ll laugh and sing before the King,!,So let his health go round.For I’m as bold as bold can be,No cobler e’er was ruder,Then here, good fellow, here’s to thee !(Rememb’ring Harry Tudor.)21>rhen I’m at work within my stall,Upon him I will think;is kindness I to mind will call,Whene’er I eat or drink ;is kindness was to me so great,The lik£ was never known ;Tis kindness I shall still repeat,And so shall my wife Joan.^’ll laugh, when I sit in my stall,And merrily will sing,That I wdth my poor last and awl,Am fellow with the King.Jut it was more, I must confess,Than I at first did know,3ut Harry Tudor ne’ertheless,Resolves it shall be so.Vnd now farewell unto Whitehall,I I homeward must retire ;fo sing and whistle in my stall,My Joan will me desire,do but think how she will laugh,When she hears of this thing,That he that drank her nut-brown aleWas England’s Royal King.CHAP. VI.••TIon the Cohler became a Courtier.Now the king considering the pleasanthumour of the cobler, how innocentl)merry he was, and free from any de¬sign ; that he was a person that laboured very hard, and took a great deal o:pains for a small livelihood, was pleasedout of his princely grace and favour, tcallow him a liberal annuity of fortymerks a year, for the better support o:his jolly humour, and the maintenanceof his wife Joan, and that he should beadmitted one of his courtiers, and thathe might have the freedom of his cellar whenever he pleased.Which being so much beyond ex-1pectation, did highly exalt the coblersfhumour, much to the satisfaction of theiking.So after a great many legs ana23crapes, he returned home to his wifefoan, -with the joyful news of his recep-ion at court; which so well pleasedter, that she did not think much at|he great pains she took in decking himor the journey.ANECDOTE OF CHARLES II.iWhen Charles II. was on a progressjjhrough his dominions, he was waitedqpon by the magistracy of a certainIity in the north of England. Thelayor had prepared, with no littletudy, a splendid oration for so memo-ible an occasion. Kneeling down toeliver his address, the worthy magis¬trate (who was excessively fat) com-lenced by a, feu de-joye of rather a sin¬gular nature : Whether he deemed anxpression of loyalty tantamount to aoyal salute of the present day, historys silent: certain it is he felt greatlyimbarrassed, and blundered his oration24most wofully. “ I hav'e, please you !majesty, begun at the wrong end” crietijthe good mayor, endeavouring to apoLogize for the incoherency of his speech j‘ So I remarked,’ replied the facetiou;monarch, ‘ but I fear the mistake can’now be corrected :—Rise up, Sir Walter Cannon.'

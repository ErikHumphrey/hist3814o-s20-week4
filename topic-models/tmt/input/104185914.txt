BOOKSELLERS.30.SONGSKATE DALRYMPLE.In a wee cot house far ayont yon muir,Whare peeseweeps, plovers, and whaups cry dreary.There lived a braw lass for mony a lang year.Wham ne’er a lover e’er ca’d deary.A lonely lass was Kate Dalrymp’e,A thrifty queen was Kate Dalrymple,Nae music except the burnies wimple,Was heard round the dwelling of Kate Dalrymple.Her face had a smack of the gruesome and grim,Which did frae the fash of a’ wooers defend her.Her lang Roman nose nearly met wi’ her chin.Which brans: folk in mind of the auld witch of Endor.A wiggle in her walk had Kate Dalrymple,A sneevle in her talk had Kate Dalrymple,And mony a cornelian and cairngorum pimple,Beamed on the dim face of Kate Dalrymple.She span tarry woo the hale winter through,Eor Kate was nae lazy but eident and thrifty.She wrought among the peats, coiled the hay, share thecorn.And supported herself by her ain hard shift aye.3But ne’er a wooer came to Kate Dalrvmple,For beauty and tocher wanted Kate Dalrymplc;Neglected was the queen by baith gentle and semple,A blank in the world seemed Kate Dalrymple.But mony are the ups and downs of life,And the dice box of fates turned tapsalteerie,So Kate fell heiress to a rich friend’s estate.And now for a wooer she’s nae cause to wearv.For the squire came a wooing to Kate Dalrvmple,The priest scraping, bowing came to Kate Dalrvmple,On each lover’s face was seen loves smiling dimple,She’s now nae mair Kate but Miss Dalrvmple-Her auld cutty stool that she used at her wheel,Was Hung by for her gilded sofa sae gaudv.Now she’s arrayed in her silk and brocade.And brags o’ her muffs and ruffs wi’ ony lady.But still an unco fash is to Kate Dalrvmple,V* as dress and party clash to Kate Dalrvmple,Bhe thought a half marrow in life mair simple,A far better match for Kate Dalrvmple.Its she often thought as she sat by hersel’dbe could wed Willie Speediespool the sarken weaver,And now to the wabster the secret she does tell.Who for love or for interest did kindly relieve her.11c flung by his heddles for Kate Dalrymple,lie burned a’ his treddles for Kate Dalrymple;Though his right e'e did skellie, and his left leg didwimple,He’s wedded now and bedded now to Kate Dalrymple.1.THE FLOWERS OF THE FOREST.I’ve heard a lilting at our ewes’ milking,Lasses a-lilting before the break of day ;But now there’s a moaning on ilka green loaning.That our braw foresters are a’ wede away.At bughts in the morning nae blythe lads are scorning,The lasses are lonely, dowie, and wae,Nae daffing, nae gibing, but sighing and subbing.Ilk ane lifts her leglen and hies her away.At e’en in the gloaming, nae swankies are roaming,’Mang stacks wi’ the lasses at bogle to play :But ilk maid sits drearie, lamenting her dearie.The flowers o’ the forest are a’ wede away.In harst at the shearing, nae younkers are jeering;The banstets are runkled, lyart and grey ;At fairs or at preaching, nae wooing, nae fleeching,Since our braw foresters are a’ wede away.O dool for the order sent our lads to the border!The English for ance by guile won the day;The flowers o’ the forest that aye shone the foremostThe prime o’ the land now lie cauld in the clay.We’ll hear nae mair lilting at the ewes milking.The women and bairns are dowie and wae.Sighing and moaning on ilka green loaning,Since our braw foresters are a’ wede away.5LOUD ROARED THE DREADFUL THUNDER.Loud roared the dreadful thunder.The rain a deluge shower;The clouds were rent asunder,By lightning’s vivid powers.The night both drear and dark,Our poor devoted bark.There she lay.Till next day.In the Bay of Biscay, O.Now dashed upon the billow,Our opening timbers creak.Each fears a wat’ry pillow,None stop the dreadful leak.To cling to slippery shrouds.Each breathless seamen crowds,As she lay.Till the day.In the Bay of Biscay, O.At length the wish’d for morrow.Broke through the hazy sky;Absorbed in silent sorrow.Each heav’d a bitter sigh:The dismal wreck to view,Struck horror to the crew.As she lay,Till the day,In the Bay of Biscay, O.6Her yielding timbers sever.Her pitchy seams are rent,When heaven, all bounteous ever,Its boundless mercy sent,A sail in sight appears,We hail her with three cheers,Now we sail.With a gale,From the Bay of Biscay, O.THE BONNY BLUE BONNET.0 whare gat ye that bonny blue bonnet ?O silly blind body canna ye see ?1 gat it

IS NO MY PLAID.O this is no my plaid,My plaid, my plaid,0 this is no my plaid.Bonny though the colours be.The ground of mine was mix’d vvi’ blue,1 got it frae the lad I loe;He ne’er has gi’en me cause to rue,And O the plaid was dear to me.Farewell ye lowland plaids o’ grev,Nae kindly charms for me ye liae.The tartan shall be mine for aye.For O the colours dear to me.For mine was silky, saft and warm,It wrapped me round frae arm to arm,And like myself it bore a charm.And O ! the plaid is dear to me.Although the lad the plaid who wore.Is now upon a distant shore;And cruel seas between us roar.I’ll mind the plaid that sheltered me..The lad that gi ed me’t likes me weel.Although his name I darna tell:He likes me just as weeks himseP ;And O the plaid is dear to me.O may the plaidie yet be worn.By Caledonians yet unborn,111 fa’ the wretch that e’er doth scorn.The plaidie that’s sae dear to me.8From surly blasts it covers me;He’ll me hinisel’ protection give;I’ll lo’e him till the day I die.And O his plaid is dear to me.I hope he’ll no forget me now.Each often pledged aith and vow ;I hope he’ll yet return to wooMe in the plaid sae dear to me.I hope the time will come my lad.When we will to the kirk and wed,Weel happit in the tartan plaid,The plaidie that’s sae dear to me.O! this will then be my plaid.My plaid, my plaid ;O! this will then be my plaid.And while I live shall ever be.YE BANKS AND BRAES.Ye hanks and braes o’ bonnie Doon,How can ye bloom sae fresh and fair ?How can ye chant ye little bn .And I sae weary fu’ o’ care ?Thou’lt break my heart thou warbling bird.That wantons through the flowering thorn ;Thou minds me o’ departed joys,Departed never to return.Oft have I roved by bonnie Doon,To see the rose and woodbine twine.And ilka bird sang o’ its love.And sae did I o’ mine.Wi’ lightsome heart I pu’d a rose,Fu’ sweet upon its thorny tree;But my fause lover stole my rose.But ah! he left the thorn wi’ me.

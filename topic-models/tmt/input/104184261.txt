Whenthe news of the profcriptian was brought tothem, they endeavoured to make their ef-cape to Brutus in Macedon. They travel¬led together fometime, mutually condolingtheir bad fortune ; but as their departurehad been very precipitate, and they werenot furnidied with money and other necef-laries for their voyage, it was agreed thatCicero fhould make what hafte he could tothe fea-fide to fecure their paffage, andQuintus returned home to make more am¬ple provifion. But as in moll houfes therev/ere as many informers as dometlics, hisNturn was immediately known, and thehoufe of courfe failed with foldiers and af-iaflins. Quintus concealed himfelf fo effec¬tually, that the foldiers could not find him ;enraged at their difappointment, they puthis fon to the torture, in order to make himdtlcover the place of his father’s conceal¬ment ; but filial affedtion was proof in theyoung Roman againft the mod exquifite tor¬ments. An involuntary figh, and fome-times a deep groan was all that could beextorted from the generous youth. His c-gonies were increased ; but with amazingfortitude he dill perfided in his refolutionof not betraying his father. Quintus was( 1$ )not far off, and the reader may imagine'bet¬ter than can be expreffed, how the heartot a father muft have been affefted with thefighs and groans of a fon expiring to favehis life. He could bear it no longer; butquitting the place of his concealment, heprefented himfelf to the afTaffins, beggingwith a flood of tears to put him to death, andclifmifs the innocent child, whofe generous* behaviour the triumvirate themfelves, if in¬formed of the fadt, vyould jndge worthy ofthe higheft approbation and reward. Butthe inhuman monfters, without being theieaft affected with the tears either of the fa¬ther or of the fon, anfwered, that they bothmuft die; the father becaufe he was profcrib-ed, and the fon becaufe he had concealedhis father. Then a new conteft of tender-|nefs arofe who fhould die firft ; but this theafiaflins kon decided, by beheading themboth at the fame time.A woman of illuftrious birth had beencondemned to be ftrangled. The Romanprator delivered her up to the triumvir, whocanfed her to be tarried to prison, in orderto her being put to death. The goaler,ftruck with compaflion, could not resolve tokill her. He chose therefore to let her dieof hunger. Befides which, he suffered herdaughter to see her in prison, taking care.( 13 )jfiowevcr, that (he brought, nothing to eat,iAs this continued many ►days, he was sur¬prised that the prisoner lived so long with¬out eating ; and suspefting the daughter,upon watching her, he discovered tha; flicmourilhed her mother with her own milk.Amazed at so pious and at the same time soingenious afi invention, he told the facr toi the triumvir and the trumvir to the praetor,who believed the thing merited relating inthe aiTembly of the people. The criminal|was pardoned; a decree was paffed thatthe mother and daughter flaould be main¬tained for the reft of their lives at the pub-lick expence, and that a temple facred topiety fliould be eretfted near the prifon.■’•'1IOlympias, Alexander’s own mother, wasoffuch an unhappy difpofition, that he wouldnever let her have any concern in the affairsof government.

The begin-i ning of their voyage was profperous ; theyI had doubled the Cape of Good Hope, and■t were fleering their courfe north-eaft to the] great continent of India, when fome gentle¬men on board, foufld in the latitude in whichi they were then failing, a large ridge of rocksi laid down in their fea-charts.

They had not failed manyhours, but juft about the dawn of day, a' terrible difafter befel them, which wouldhave been prevented if they had lain by.IThe fliip {truck upon a rock. 1 leave to thereader’s imagination, what a feene of horrorthis dreadful accident muft occafion amongtwelve hundred perlons, all in the same in-t to )evitable danger; beholding with fearful a-fionifhment, that inftantaneous death whichnow flared them in the face !In this diftress the captain ordered thepinnace to be launched, into which havingtofied a small quantity of biscuit, and someboxes of marmalade, he jumped in him¬self with nineteen others, who, with 'theirswords, prevented the coming in of anymore, leaft the boat fhould fink. In thiscondition they put of into the great Indianocean, without a compass to fleer hy, orany frefh water but what might happen tofall from the heavens, whose mercy alonecould deliver them. After they had rowedto and fro four days in this miserable con¬dition, the captain, who had been for sometime very Tick and weak, died ; this added,if pofiible, to their misery; for as they nowfell into confufion, every one would governand none would obey. This obliged themto eleft one of their own company to com¬mand them, whose ©rders they implicitly a-greed to follow. This person proposed tothe company to draw lots, and to call everyfourth man over board ; as their small flockof provifions was so far spent, as not to beable at a very fhort allowance to suflain lifeabove three days longer. In the boat werea friar and a carpenter, who, with their newcaptain, they exempted, as their lives were©f much consequence.( i7 )Tfce tnrefe firft, after having confeffed andureccived absolution, submuted to their fate.“The fourth, whom fortune condemned, wasa Portuguese gentleman that had a youngeribrother in the boat, who seeing him aboutto be thrown over-board, moft tenderly em¬braced him, and with tears in his eyes be¬sought him to let him die in his room, en¬forcing his arguments by telling him that •iihe was a married sman, and had a wife andIchildren at Goa, befides the care of threefilters, who absolutely depended upon him;that as for himself, he was fingle, and hisI life of no great importance : he thereforeconjured him to suffer him to supply hisplace. The elder brother, aftonilhed, andmelting with this generofity, replied, thatlince the divine Providence had appointedhim to suffer, it would be wicked and un¬juft to permit any other to die for him, es¬pecially a brother, to whom he was infinite¬ly obliged. The younger, perffting in hispurpose, would take no denial; bin throw¬ing bimself on his knees, held his brother sofaft that the company could not disengagethem. 1 bus they disputed for a while, theelder brother bidding him to be a father tohis children, and recommended his wife tohis protection, and as he would inherit hiseftate, to take care of their common filters:but all he could say could not make theyounger defift. This was a scene of tender-( i8 )jiess that muft fill every breafl: susceptible o;generous impreffions witn pity. At lafi; theiconftancy of the elder brother, yielded rcthe piety of the other. He acquiesced, and1suffered the gallant you: h to supply his place;.who being caff: into the sea, and a goodswimmer, soon got to the ftern of the pin¬nace, and laid hold of the rudder with his i1right hand, wh ch being perceived by one IOf the Jailors, he cut oft' the hand with h’.Sifword, then droping into the lea, he prefent-ly caught hold again with his left, which)received the lame fate by a fecond blow;/thus difmembered of both hands, he made:,a (hift notwithftanding to’ keep himfelf a-bove water with h;$ feet and two flumps,which he held bleeding upwards.This moving fpe&acle fo raifed the pityof the whole company, that they cried out,he is but one man, let us endeavour to favehis life ; and he was accordingly taken intothe boat, where he had his hands bound upas well as the place and circumllances couldpermit. They rowed all that night and the |next morning, when the fun arofe, as ifheaven would reward the gallantry and pietyof this 'young man, they diferied land,which proved to be the mountains Mozam¬bique, in Africa, not far from a Portuguefecolony.

FAIR ROSAMOND,OTHERWISE ELEANOR CLIFFORD;AND HERROYAL PARAMOUR, IIE1Y THE SECOND.KING OF ENGLAND.WITH AN AFFECTING ACCOUNT OF HER MELAN¬CHOLY AND HORRIBLE DEATH,AT THE HANDS OF THEINJURED QUEEN ELEANORIN THE BOWER OP WOODSTOCK.HISTORYOFFAIR ROSAMOND,Henry the second was crowned king of England initlie year 1154 ; he was an amorous man, though arijgreat warrior, and took great delight in the con-jjlversation of the fair ladies with which his courtkill abounded. The courtiers being very assiduous inIk humouring the inclinations of their monarch, Henry] ifrequently conversed with them on the subject of(jiamours; and once commending, with more thanbtordinary warmth, the charms of a lady whose com-n|pany he had been in on the preceding evening, oneiof the courtiers, whom the king highly esteemed«|for his personal valour, thus replied—“ Your majesty, it must be allowed, is an excel-lli lent judge of beauty, and the lady whom you speak' of is a charming and elegant woman. But I havea niece who as far surpasses her in beauty, as sheMj excels the most ordinary women in your dominions,t) Her eyes sparkle like twin stars ; her complexionoutvies the lily, and her cheeks the rose. Herdimpled chin adds beauty to the rest, and makesher face a perfect oval; and her hands and armsexcel, both in form and whiteness, the work of thefinest painter or statuary ; and no language can dojustice to her majestic form and graceful mein.”1.4The king’s imagination being tired by this des¬cription, he eagerly enquired in what corner of thenation so great a beauty could be concealed fromhis view, and if he could not obtain an audience,that he might be satisfied if her person equalledhis account, or if the affections of her uncle did notblind him.The nobleman, now perceiving his error, and thatthe praises he had thought justly bestowed uponhis niece might lead her to ruin, cooly replied, liehad only made this relation to give a true definitionof beauty, and implored his majesty to pardon hispresumption.The king possessed too much penetration not toperceive the meaning of the courtier’s answer. Hogrew exceedingly angry; and commanded the noble¬man, on his allegiance, to tell him the truth.Being in fear of the king’s displeasure, he plainlyanswered, “ My liege, there is such a lady, daughterof Walter, Lord Clifford, and of his lady, my sister,living in Godstowe, in Oxfordshire. Many noblepersons have sought her in marriage, but have meta refusal; her tender heart not being yet disposedto love.”“ And this I affirm is the truth, on the forfeitureof my head. As for the name of the fair creature,it is Rosamond; and indeed she is the peerless roseof the world.” While they were thus discoursing,queen Eleanor came to visit the king, which brokeof any further conversation.It was not long before the king resolved to invitehimself to her father’s house, and to that end tooka progress into Oxfordshire, attended only by sometrusty courtiers, and was highly welcomed by theLord Clifford and his lady; fearing his design, theyordered their daughter not to appear in his presence ;but the king bidding one of his attendants to en¬quire of the servants if she was at home, and findingshe was, demanded to see her, vowing he would notdine till he had ; so that all their excuse of illnessavailed nothing. She was ordered to put on herbest apparel, and come down, that she might payher duty to the king. Her blushes added to herbeauty, so that at first sight she appeared in hiseyes like an angel. He commanded she should sitdown, causing her to be placed directly opposite tohim, on whose eyes he so long gazed, that he forgotoftentimes to eat.The king having been entertained by Lord Clif¬ford for three days together, he had several oppor¬tunities to discourse privately with the charmingfair, whom he so much won upon with the presentsof fine jewels, and other costly things, that he raisedan ambition in her tender breast, to glitter near athrone, though but in tinsel splendour. He alsobestowed his gold liberally on her tutoress. Havinggiven store of gold to the servants, he took leave ofhis mistress, which he had no sooner done, than heheard that troubles were again risen in his terri¬tories beyond the seas, which required his presenceto allay and settle.The king raising a gallant army passed intoFrance. The terror of his name so daunted hisenemies, that they quickly fled, leaving the townsand castles they had surprised to his obedience.Yet in the midst of war, his love prevailed, andmade him write to Rosamond; and after she receivedit, it filled her with fears and irresolutions, notknowing how she should behave herself in a matterconcerning her fame and chastity ; but the glitteringprospect of greatness and honour proceeding on theother hand, she resolved to show it to her tutoress,who had not been negligent in soliciting her toaccept the king’s love and favour, expecting therebyadvancement to herself, if she should be effectuallyinstrumental in bringing it to pass.GShe had no sooner read tho letter, than shosmiling said, “ My dear child, you may see thatall the happy constellations agree, so excellent abeauty must not be enjoyed by a mean person; youare made for a queen, and the yielding now to for¬tune promised is a large step towards a throne.Lay aside your blushes, and send him a comfortableanswer. Let not too much modesty hinder you ofbeing the mistress of so noble a king.”This made her blushes come and go, long strug¬gling within herself, till at last this crafty matronused so many arguments, that she returned thefollowing answer:—“ Great Sire,—It is with no small astonishmentI read a letter, subscribed with your royal name,and sent to me, as I suppose, by your hand. I amaltogether ignorant of any such power in me, as tomake a captive of a king: but cpuld not, I confess,read without pleasure, that my idea, as your majestyis pleased to flatter me,- should have an influence inmaking you a conqueror over your enemies. Mayit please your majesty, I cannot but interest myselfso much in your affairs, as to rejoice when you arevictorious, and be glad of your success ; but as tomy being placed in a glittering sphere, above thoreach of those I dread, I neither understand it, nordare I give myself the liberty of thinking whatyour majesty’s meaning may be; but, as I know,I deserve no such promotion, neither do I desire it;so much as my own innocence, your majesty’s royalgoodness is sufficient to keep mo from any thingintended by it, that is incompatible with the strict¬est rules of honour and virtue. And thereforepraying for your majesty’s happiness, prosperity,and safe return, I beg leave with the humblestsubmission to subscribe myself,Your ever dutiful and most obedient subject,ROSAMOND.”7The tutoress having got this letter from theinnocent young lady, she inclosed it in one writtenby herself to the king, The king was pleased withthe letters, and made all the haste he could to putan end to the affairs that kept him in Normandy.Now it happened that the lady Clifford going‘into her daughter’s closet, accidentally espied theking’s letter to Rosamond; at which, being greatlysurprised, as knowing nothing of what had passedbetween them, she called her daughter to her, andasked what was the meaning of that letter? Rosa¬mond, as much surprised at that question as hermother was at the letter, knew not what to answer.Her mother taking her silence for an argument ofher guilt, took the letter in her hand, and wentimmediately to Lord Clifford, who had a very ten¬der love for Rosamond, and shewing him the letter,he was exceedingly disturbed: and they went totheir daughter’s chamber, upbraiding her with beingcriminal with the king, and taking away the onlycomfort of their lives, who looked on her as theirchief treasure. She kneeled down and solemnlyprotested she was an unblemished virgin, and thatshe never had yet given herself up to the king’sembraces. This letter, she said, was presented toher by an unknown hand, as she was going tochapel, not knowing it was from the king till shehad read it, which whilst she was doing the mes¬senger withdrew. And now, my honoured father,1 desire to know wherein I am criminal, unless itbe not acquainting you I had received the letter.Her father replied,—“ My only child, my dearRosamond, the staff and comfort of thy father’sage, I am glad to find thou art innocent. Whathonour would it be to have said, Rosamond is kingHenry’s concubine, and for unlawful love has losther virtue ! The king’s addresses to thee are theeffects of lust, and not of love, lie has a queen toswhom his love is due ; and think what jealous ragewill fill her breast, when she shall know you haverobbed her of her king: for jealousy is hell to themind, and a terror to the conscience, surpassingreason, and inciting rage. Think then what thoumayest expect in thy unlawful love. Thou wilt besure to lose thy virtue and honour, thy chastity,thy reputation, perhaps thy life ; and, which ismost of all, thy soul, without repentance. If,therefore, thou wilt change thy virgin state, I willtake care and get a husband for thee, with whomthou mayest live honestly ; and that, perhaps, mayquench the fire of lust thy beauty may have kindledin the king, and make thee safe, and thy parentshappy.”Rosamond gave great attention to her father’swords, assuring him, with many asseverations, shewould do the utmost of her power to avoid whatshould be displeasing to him ; but as to changingher condition she did humbly beg to be excused.Her mother thereon said,—“ Rosamond, it wouldbe more to my satisfaction, and to your father’s, toseo you married, for then 1 could believe you outof danger ; and you know my Lord Fitzwaiter hasa passion for you ; a nobleman of an illustriousfamily, as wealthy too, as most lords in the king¬dom ; your father would be glad of such a son-in-law, and so should I, to see you well married ;therefore do not stand in your own light, lest youthereby make us both believe you have too great akindness for the king.”Rosamond said she hoped they wrould not put herupon courting my Lord Fitzwalter, however accom¬plished he might be ; for it was enough for her toentertain him when he came to court her. Herfather told her, as to that, he would take care allthings should be managed to her satisfaction.But while the good Lord Clifford and his lady9]were pleased with their designed proposal of theirdaughter, king Henry returned from Normandy,haying concluded his business there, and madepeace with France, and with his sons. This madeRosamond indifferent to the Lord Fitzwalter, who,by permission of her father, was at their mansion.She told him she had a greater kindness for him,than to expose him to the king’s resentment: forshe was sure whoever addressed her must suffer theking’s anger. This was such a blow to the younglord, as quickly cooled his love ; for he had nomind to have the king for Ins rival. Before hewent away he told Rosamond’s father how he hadbeen dismissed, who then perceiving there was notrusting to what she said, resolved to take anothercourse and save her from impending ruin, thoughagainst her will; and to that end, in two daystime, ordered a coach to be got ready, and everytiling prepared for a long journey ; and then callingfor Alethea, Rosamond’s false governess, of whomthey had not the least mistrust, told her theirthoughts of the king’s love to Rosamond, and towhat misery it would expose her, that she and Ro¬samond to-morrow morning must, with all privacyimaginable, depart from hence to Cornwall, unto akinsman’s there, near to Lancaston ; there she maylive in private undiscovered till the king’s affec¬tions are diverted, or placed upon some otherbeauty.”The next morning Rosamond and her governessset out for Cornwall, and in a few days came toher kinsman’s house, where they were well receiv¬ed. King Henry having intelligence thereof, re¬solved to have her out of their hands, and there¬upon sent for her uncle, and told him he had apiece of service to command of him, in which liewould expect to be punctually obeyed. That noble¬man told him, lie hoped he would not question his10allegiance for the performance of his duty; andtherefore humbly besought his majesty to let himknow what service it was to do. “ It is,” said theking, “ to go to Cornwall, where, at your kins¬man’s, near Lancaston, you will find your beaute¬ous kinswoman, Rosamond. Present her with thisjewel from me, and use your endeavours to bringher to my court without her parents’ knowledge.”Her uncle seemed startled at a command so farfrom what he expected, which, when the king ob¬served, “0, my lord,” said he, “have I shockedyou, then? Where is your allegiance now?”“ Here is my heart,” replied her uncle, “ whereit has always been ; of which your majesty shallsoon be satisfied, by my obedience for he was loththe king should think that he was unwilling toobey him, lest he should incur his displeasure, andrun the risk of having those great offices he heldunder the king taken from him. He set off toCornwall—and found his kinswoman willing to ac¬cept his offer ; and therefore, without more to do,provided for her journey a very noble chariot;and so, attended by her tutoress, and a few trustyservants, he brought her to court, and put her intothose lodgings which the king had appointed forher reception.Her uncle having acquainted the king that shewas come, and how ho had disposed of her, he wentthat very night to pay her a visit. The monarchseeing that beauty in its first perfection, whichr^asbut blooming when he saw her last, was surprisedwith wonder and amazement. Rosamond fell onher knees, on which he raised her up with this ex¬ordium : “ 0 fairest of creatures under heaven!kneel not to me, for thy excellent beauty com¬mands all knees and hearts to bow to thee.” Ro¬samond answered—“ Under the frowns of my of¬fended parents, I beg protection at your royal hand,III and that within yom- court I may be free.” Theking extolled the beauty of Rosamond, and pro¬mised to protect her, for they might as well take' *he crown off his head as offer the least injury.The discourse having passed, a short collationli | ensued, wherein the king shewed himself extremely!| pleased. After supper, the king told her, that init regard to the fatigues of her journey, he wouldI give her no further disturbance that night, butwould soon visit her again ; and charging her uncleto have a particular regard to her, and see thatft she wanted nothing, he took leave of her. Alethea,| her tutoress, was still with her, and did all she9 could to persuade her to yield to the king’s em¬braces ; but Rosamond seemed averse to it, what1 her father had said always running in her mind.The king, who had two or three times visited|! Rosamond, began to be impatient of delay, andI thought it was time to have some close conversa¬tion with her. And coming one evening to seeher, he accosted her in these terms :—“ I have hitherto flattered myself, my sweet Ro¬samond, that you had an affection for me ; but nowI begin to find I was mistaken ; for I too plainlysee you have no regard forme.”“How,” said Rosamond, “ can your majestythink I have no regard for my protector, in whoseroyal court I live here secretly ? If I have beenany way wanting in my duty, or given your ma¬jesty just occasion for such ideas, pray let me knowit, that I may better pay your majesty the duty Iawe; but notwithstanding what you have beenpleased to say, I can hardly believe your majestythinks so.”“ How is it possible,” replied the king, “ I canthink otherwise, when I have been your captive,and yet you offer not to set me free ? Have I notoften told you that you had wounded me, and yetyou never go about to apply that sovereign balmby which only my wounds are capable of beingcured ? And is not this next to a demonstrationthat you have no love for me?”To this Rosamond, with blushes that renderedher still more beautiful, replied—“ Your majesty is pleased to speak to me infigures ; but 1 am a simple maid, and cannot un¬derstand you.”“ Ah, Rosamond,” said the king, “ I know youunderstand me well enough ; who is more blindthan those that will not see ? But since you forceme to speak plainly, know it is your beauty thathas wounded me ; and it is your charms make mea captive. Love calls for love, nor can my woundsbe cured without enjoyment: if therefore you havethe regard for me your words seem to intimate,shew that it is real, by admitting me to your em¬braces, and grant me the full fruition of your love.”Rosamond, extremly disordered at what the kingsaid, was going to kneel down, but he would not •suffer her, and said—“ Kneel not, dearest Rosamond ; it is I thatshould kneel to thee—1 only ask—”Rosamond interrupting him, said—“ Ask for my life, great sire, and you shall have iit, or any thing that is in my power to give ; butask not for my honour, that is so precious and va¬luable—I can never part with it but to a husband.My outward form is but a casquet, virtue is thejewel, and when that is gone, what worth is the |other.”The king was surprised to hear such words fromRosamond, of whom he thought to make an easyconquest, and was as much in love with her virtueas he was with her beauty. But as ho knew thatstones, by continual dropping of the water, wearaway, so he never doubted, but, with repeated soli-1 *>citations, ho might at last overcome this stubbornbeauty ; and therefore to what she had said, liethus replied:—“ Kings, you know, have a peculiar prerogative,and move in spheres above the common rank;their privilege is to have many wives, when sub¬jects are by law confined to one ; and thereforethough Eleanor be queen, yet Rosamond, shallreign as well as she, and even in my command aschief. We will be mai-ried first, my Rosamond,and then I hope you will not scruple.”“ I know not, sire,” said Rosamond, “whetherit be a lawful thing to marry one that has a wifealready : but if that can be proved, I have nothingto object, for I have no aversion to your person ;nay, I have a value for you beyond others, both asa man, and much more as you are my king and so¬vereign.”The king made many promises to make herhappy, if she had agreed to what he had proposed;and having left Rosamond, went to Alethea, andtold her what repulses he had met with from Ro¬samond, instead of that enjoyment he expected.Alethea told the king, that if his majesty pleasedto follow her humble advice, he should not enterinto farther parlies with her, but that he shouldfind a nearer way to the happiness he desired ; foras to being married, it would be both a dilatorything, and of no avail when it was done, as she in¬tended to inform Rosamond.“ But what is the way, then, you would adviseme to do?” said the king.“ May it please your majesty,” said Alethea,“ the way I would have you take is this—that youshould come into my chamber to-morrow night, alittle before bed-time, and I will leave you therealone till I have got my lady to bed : and as I liowith her, I will delay the time of my going to bed14till she is asleep, and then I will bring jour majestyinto the chamber, and you shall go to bed toher in my stead ; and I doubt not but before themorning all her anger will be over, and for thefuture your admittance will be easy.”The king was pleased with the contrivance ofAlethea; and, as a token, presented her with adiamond ring, and told her he would follow heradvice, and be with her incognito the next night.The next evening the king came according topromise, and Alethea went in to get Rosamond tobed, as she was wont to do : and in about an hour’stime (which the king’s impatience of delay madehim think an age) she came back again to theking, and told him that if he pleased to follow her,she would bring him to Rosamond, who was inher bed and asleep.The king needed no persuasions to follow her ;but went immediately to her chamber, and theresoon disrobed himself; and Alethea taking herleave of him, left him alone with Rosamond. Theking having shut the door, and locked it after Ale¬thea, went into bed to Rosamond, who was fastasleep, little dreaming of the treacherous part thatAlethea played. The king, not willing to awakehis charming mistress, lay still; but she awakedof herself. And now the king thought it a propertime to speak to her, and let her know who it wasthat was her bed-fellow. It is not easy to imaginethe surprise of Rosamond at this discovery, andshe fain would have risen, but the king preventedher. When the morning appeared, the sun havingawakened Rosamond, she was surprised to find her¬self in the king’s arms, which summoned the bloodinto her face, and added fresh beauty to her charms.The king, to keep her spirits, said, “ My dear Ro¬samond, as thou hast obliged me, doubt not but Iwill be true to thee.” And hereupon sealing hispromises with many kisses, he took his leave.For a time these happy lovers often met, andenjoyed their love in private; but some courtladies to whom the Icing had been yont to shewthe same kindness, finding themselves now neglect¬ed, for this peerless beauty, being filled with re¬venge and indignation, did, by their secret whis¬pers, soon spread about the king’s familiarity wishRosamond.Queen Eleanor being outrageous when she per¬ceived that no kind words, nor intreaties mixedwith threats, could wean the king’s affections fro uhis mistress, though he laboured all other ways hecould to please and pacify her, set her engines atwork to fright her from Ids arms, and for the safetyof her life, to immure herself in a nunnery.Fair Rosamond having found some of those let¬ters that threatened her life, which were droppedon purpose for her to read, shewed them to theking, who made such strict enquiry concerning it,that some of those who had done it were discoveredby the similarity of hands, and severely punished ;and nvmy of the ladies who spoke detractingly andgave iiiU'ont, were banished the court; insomuch,that perceiving the king was in earnest, and reso¬lutely bent to defend his fair one, they gave overany further project of this nature.To prevent violence, he appointed a guard towait on her at home and abroad: and to removeher further from the queen’s sight, that her envyand continual clamours, if possible might cease, hecaused a stately palace, called the delightful bowerof Woodstock, in Oxfordshire, to be built at greatcost, with all the cunning turnings and windingsimaginable, far exceeding the Delian Labyrinth,which he appointed for her country retirement.The bower had many entries and passages un¬derground, into which the light came throughnarrow stone crevices, shaded witli bushes, not per-10ceivaLle to those that walked above, rising withdoors in hills far distant, to escape from dangerupon any timely notice, though the place shouldbe oven besieged and surrounded; and within wereintricate mazes and windings, through long entries,rooms, and galleries, secured with an hundred andfifty doors.To find the way out of and into the most remoteapartments, the skilful artist had left a clue of sil¬ver thread, without the guidance of which it wasan impossibility to be done. About this bowerwere curious gardens, fountains, and a wilderness,with all manner of delights for pleasant situationand recreation, to furnish it as another earthlyparadise for so fair a creature to inhabit; and therethe king often resorted to see his beloved Rosa¬mond.But this more enraged the queen ; not only thatshe should have so famous a palace built on pur¬pose for her, but that the king staid whole weekson his visits, and another enjoyed the embracesshe expected: wherefore she consulted with hersons, grown men, how to be revenged ; and aftermany things argued and considered, it was agreedamongst them, that Prince Richard, afterwardsking of England, should go over and join theFrench, to raise war against his father in Norman¬dy, then belonging to the crown of England, whichwhilst he effected, speedily would withdraw theking to aid his subjects, and subdue Ids enemies ;and leaving his fair mistress behind him, and Ro¬samond being destitute of her chief defence, mightbe open to their plots and contrivances against herlife, which while lie was present, would be frus¬trated. Nor was Prince Richard slow in this, butmade a fierce war, beat the king’s lieutenant, andtook many towns, which news coming to the king’scar, roused him like a lion from his den, and fdledJ . 17! him -with priucely resolution of revenge: it is true,I indeed, the different passions of revenge and love’I long struggled in his breast; but love at last gaveway to honour, vowing his love should make his; revenge more sharp ; and therefore he resolved togo with a well-disciplined army.The king, firm to his resolves, being just readyI to depart for Normandy, went, last of all, to take! his leave of Rosamond, and to assure her of hislove and kindness. The king came in, and found[ her on the floor, in the utmost grief, sighing such| breaths of sorrow, that her lips which late appearedi like buds, were now overblown.' It would have,! raised the pity of a marble breast to see the tearsforce through her lovely eyes, and lodge them¬selves on her red murmering lips, which, after a! small respite, said,—“Ah! dearest Prince! howcruel is unkind fortune unto lovers, that we mustso soon part; and my presaging soul forebodesnever to meet again in this world, if now you leaveme to the irreconcileable hatred of my mercilessi enemy, quite void of your royal shelter and protec¬tion. 0, for this did I resign myself into yourarms, and give up my virgin innocence, and un¬spotted treasure to your pleasure! 0, is there noEnglish general trusty and valiant enough to de¬feat and scourge your rebels, but must you be se¬parated from your faithful, constant Rosamond,and venture your precious life, which is now dearerto me than my own?”She would have proceeded, but sorrow for atime stopped the utterance of her voice ; and- shehad fallen to the ground, had not the king caughther in his arms, tenderly embracing her, and kiss¬ing her wan and faded cheeks and lips a thousandtimes: then setting her down by him, he said,“ Fairest of creatures, afflict me not thus with thytears, Dearest Rosamond, at my entreaty let them18cease to flow, and let not sorrow impair thy lovelybeauties. I will wear them on my heart, nor shallthe rude alarms of war drive thy image thence.”To this Rosamond, with her tears still flowing,and her snowy arms cast about his neck, replied—‘ ‘ And why may I not go with my much lovedlord? I’ll dress like a page, and wait on you inall your dangers ; and when in the heat of battleyour life is in danger by the threatening sword orspear, I will boldly step between, and, by receivingthe wounds that threaten you, guard your life withthe loss of my own. 0 take me with you ; forthere is no such safety for me as in your royalcamp : but wanting you, my life is death.She would have proceeded, but the king, inter¬rupting her, said—“ My fairest rose, you are notfit to brook the toils of war; therefore you muststay in England’s peaceful soil till I return. ” Thencalling to Sir Thomas, her uncle, the trusty knight,who had first given him the account of her beauty,he said—“ Here, worthy knight, I commit this in¬estimable treasure, far more valuable than a king¬dom. Take to you a strong guard for a defence,and be careful, I charge you, as you tender yourlife, that none be permitted to see her till my re¬turn : and expect, my fair mistress, I shall oftenwrite to you, and require your answers.”“Alas! (said she) this parting is worse thandeath ; and I am afraid my death will be the fatalissue of it. I am sure the soul and body cannotpart with so great pains as I now part with you.Fairt would I speak the last farewell, but I cannot,there are so many deaths in that hard word, (to,royal sire, that I may know my grief; for grief isbut guessed while thou art by : but I too soon shallknow what absence is ; it is the sun’s parting fromthe frozen north, whilst I stand looking on someicy cliff, to watch the last low circles that hemakes, till he sinks down from heaven!”19“Ah, Rosamond! (replied the king to her) mi¬sthinks there is much mournful sweetness in partinthat I could hang for ever on thy arms, and lookaway my life into thy eyes ; but I must hasten.|“ And so must I, (said Rosamond) if death be far;(for this is the stage to which I am going; fromwhence I never, never shaU'return!”The disconsolate Rosamond gave herself up t)■ sorrow and melancholy, refusing to be comforte ljfor some weeks; and when she slumbered, sh -started, crying out, “ O save me! save me! here i-the queen, she has got at me at last!” and withthe fright awaked, terrified with her dreams. • Norwas it without reason that Rosamond was thus af¬flicted in her mind, for all this while, Queen Elea¬nor was plotting her destruction; which to effect,she first proposed it to some favourites, whom she| had raised from a low condition to high promotion ;■and by persuasions and large offers prevailed soi far with them, that they vowed to stand by her ina any dangerous attempt.It being summer time, she undertook an excur-rsion, as she gave out, for her health ; appointingat a set time her conspirators to hide themselvesin a cave near the bower, she hid herself in a grove,and sent one of her pages, dressed as a post-boyto deliver a letter to Sir Thomas, the keeper of thebower, and into no other hand, for such was theking’s express command, and when he had deliver¬ed it, immediately to blow his horn.The cunning device took, and Sir Thomas wasimmediately slain by those in ambush. The gatesbeing seized by the party, the queen came to thepalace, and getting the silver clue, she entered thebower, causing all the servants she found to beslain; and in the furthermost retirement, in achamber gilded, she found Rosamond, the objectof her hate, all dazzling in robes of silver, adorned20■with gems shining like an angel, at which sightshe some time stood amazed, and began to melt inpity ; hut jealousy soon reviving the flame of fury,with a stern countenance, she said, “ Have 1 foundthee, thou graceless wretch, who hast shamefullytaken away my husband from me! Come, lay asideyour gaudy trappings, and receive the reward dueto such as commit crimes like thine.Rosamond seeing the angry queen before her,and hearing these dire words, trembled from headto foot. She fell on her knees before her, implor¬ing mercy aud pardon for her offences, with a floodof tears, begging she would have pity on her tenderyears, and pardon a crime she was constrained toact, and she would immediately immure herself ina nunnery, and see the king no more, or else ab¬jure the land ; and if she had not deserved to live,yet she humbly besought her in mercy and tendercompassion to the infant that struggled in herwomb, that she might live, though in a dungeon,till she was delivered, and then she would willinglysubmit to die, so that the child might be savedalive.This last request the more incensed the jealousqueen ; for, hearing she was with child her furybroke forth beyond all moderation, when snatchingup a golden bowl, which stood on the table, shepoured a draught of deadly poison into it, whichshe had brought with her, commanding her todrink it up immediately; at this she trembled, andbegged mercy with tears, when the queen pulledout a dagger, and held it to her breast, saying,“ If you cannot relish poison, see here is steel torid you of the world.” The sorrowful lady per¬ceiving there was no remedy, but she must die,stood upon her feet, and with many tears, andpiteously wringing her hands, intreated mercy ofCod for her youthful sins and failings, desiring21that all beauties might be warned by her sad fall,not to be proud and aspiring, but contented with asafe condition ; and, often calling for mercy, she,with a trembling hand, put the bowl to her mouth,and drank the poison, which ended her life.Not long after the death of Fair Rosamond, theking, who had many strange dreams concerningher, returned home victorious ; but hearing of hertragical end, his joy turned into mourning, and indistraction he rent his royal robe, shut himself upin his chamber, and suffered not any one to speakto him for many days.When the king had a little eased his grief, hosummoned his judges, and commanded them tomake a strict enquiry after those that were guiltyof these heinous crimes. They, fearing his dis¬pleasure, were so diligent therein, that most ofthem were apprehended, tried, and put to severalof the most cruel deaths, who, in their tortures,accused the queen, and laid the blame on her, whowas not able to bear out herself, for .so fierce wasthe king’s indignation, that the tears and interces¬sion of the nobles on her behalf were of no avail;but being a foreign princess, her life was spared ;yet the king not only renounced her, but confinedher for her life-time to a strict imprisonment; andcommanded, if she died there, her body should notbo buried, but there to moulder to dust; nor wouldhe forgive her at her death. Rosamond, both inher life-time, and at her death, was a benefactressto the abbey of Godstowe, where she desired to boburied, with which dying request of one so dear tothem in her life, the nuns readily complied. Thishappened in the year 1177, which was the 24th ofthe reign of Henry II.22ALONZO THE BRAVE.A wahriok so bold, and virgin so bright,Conven’d as they sat on the green ;They gaz’d on each other with tender delight,Alonzo the Brave was the name of the knight.The maid was the Fair Imogene.“ And ah,” said the youth, “ since to-morrow I goTo fight in a far distant land,Thy tears for my absence soon ceasing to How,Some other will court you, and you will bestowOn a wealthier suitor your hand.”“ Oh, hush these suspicions,” fair Imogene said,“ So hurtful to love and to me ;Or if you be living, or if you be dead,I swear by the Virgin, that none in your stead,Shall husband of Imogene be.And, if e’er for another my heart should decide,Forgetting Alonzo the Brave,God grant, that to punish my falsehood and pride,Thy ghost at my marriage may sit by my side,May tax me with perjury, claim me as bride,And bear me away to the grave.”To Palestine hasten’d the warrior so bold,His love she lamented him sere ;But scarce had a twelvemonth elaps’d, when behold,A baron, all cover’d with jewels and gold,Arriv’d at fair Imogene’s door.His treasure, his presents, his spacious domain,Soon made her untrue to her vows ;He dazzl’d her eyes, he bewilder’d her brain,lie caught her affection, so light and so vain,And carried her home as his spouse.oo~oAnd now had the marriage been blest by the priest.The revelry now was begun ;The tables they groan’d with the weight of the feast,i Nor yet had the laughter and merriment ceas’d,When the bell of the castle toll’d—One !| ’Twas then, with amazement, fair Imogene found,A stranger was plac’d by her side ;Illis air was terrific, he utter’d no soupd,He spoke not, he mov’d not, he look’d not around,But earnestly gaz’d on the bride.His visor was clos’d, and gigantic his height.His armour was sable to view ;All laughter and pleasure were hush’d at his sight.The dogs as they ey’d him, drew back with affright.And the lights in the chamber burnt blue.|| His presence all bosoms appear’d to dismay.The guests sat in silence and fear ;ft At length spoke the bride, while she trembled—“ I pray,$ Sir Knight, that your helmet aside you would lay,And deign to partake of our cheer.”| The lady is silent—the stranger complies.And his visor he slowly unclos’d—0 (jlod, what a sight met Imogene’s eyes.What words can express her dismay and surprise,When a skeleton’s head was expos’d.i All present then utter’d a terrified shout;And turn’d with disgust from the scene ;The worms they crept in, and the worms theycrept out,( And sported his eyes and temples about,While the spectre address’d Imogene 5“ Behold me, thou false one, behold mo,” he cried,“ Behold thy Alonzo the Brave,God grant that, to punish thy falsehood and pride,My ghost at thy marriage should sit by thy side,►Should tax thee with perjury, claim thee as bride,And bear thee away to the grave.”This saying, Ids arms round the lady he wound,While fair Imogene shriek’d with dismay ;Then sunk with his prey through the wide-yawn¬ing ground,Nor never again was fair Imogene found,Or the spectre that bore her away.Not long liv’d the baron, and none, since that time,To inhabit the castle presume;For chronicles tell, that by order sublime.There Imogene suffers the pain of her crime,And mourns her deplorable doom.At midnight four times in each year does her sprite,When mortals in slumber are bound.Array’d in her bridal apparel of white,Appear in the hall with her skeleton knight,And shrieks as he whirls her around.While they drink out of skulls newly torn from thegrave,Dancing round them pale spectres are seen :Their liquor is blood, and this horrible staveThey howl, “ To the health of Alonzo the Brave,And his consort the false Imogene.”

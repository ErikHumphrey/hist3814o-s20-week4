Sir James ? she says,or where now are you riding?O I am bound to a foreign land,for now I’m under hiding!Where shall I go ? where shall I run ?where shall I go to hide me ?For I have kill’d a gallant ’Squire,and they’re seeking to slay me.O go ye down to yon ale-house,and I’ll pay there your lawing jAnd if I be a woman true,I’ll meet you in the dawning.I’ll not go down to yon ale-house,for you to pay my lawing,There's forty shillings for one supper jI’ll stay in’t till the dawning.6He’s turn’d him right and round about,and row’d him in his breohan ;And he has gone to take a sleepin the lowlands of Ruknghen.He was not well gone out of sight,nor was he past MilslrethenTill four and twenty belted knights,a came riding o’er the Leathen.O have you seen Sir James the Rose,the young heir of Bukighen ?For he has kill’d a gallant ’Squire,and we’re sent out to take him.O I have seen Sir James, she says,for he past here on Monday,If the steed be swift that he rides on,lie’s past the gates of London.But as they were going away,then she call’d out behind themIf you do seek Sir James, she says.I’ll tell you where you’d find him ;You’ll seek the bank above the mill,in the lowlands of Buleighen,And there you’ll find Sir James the Rose,lying sleeping in his brechan.7You must not wake him out of sleep,Nor yet must you affright him,Till you run a dart quite thro’ his heart,and thro’ the body pierce him.r£hey sought the bank above the mill,in the lowlands of Buleighen,And there they found Sir James the Rose,a-sleeping in his brechan.Then out bespoke Sir John the Graeme,who had the charge a-keeping,It’s ne'er be said, dear gentlemen,we kill’d him when a-sleeping.They seiz’d his broad sword and his targe,and closely him surrounded ;But when he wak’d out of his sleep,his senses were confounded,O pardon ! pardon ! gentlemen,have mercy now upon me !Such as you gave, such you shall have,and so we’ll fall upon thee.Donald, my man, wait me upon,and I’ll give you my biechan ;And if you stay here till I die,you'll get my trews of tartan.8There is fifty pounds in my pocket,besides my trews and brechan ;You’ll get my watch and diamond ring,and take me to Loch Largon.Now they have taken out his heart,and stuck it on a spear,Then took it to the house of Marr,and gave it to his dear.But when she saw his bleeding heart,she was like one distracted!She smote her breast, & wrung her handscrying. What now have I acted!Sir James the Rose, now for thy sake,my heart is now a-breaking !Curst be the dav I did thee betray,thou brave knight of Buleighen.Then up she rose, and forth she goes,all in that fatal hour.And bodily was borne away,and never was seen more.But where she went was never ken’d,and so to end the matter,A traitor’s end, you may depend,can never be no better.

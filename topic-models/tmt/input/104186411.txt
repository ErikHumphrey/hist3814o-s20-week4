Although composed near¬ly three hundred years ago, it still continuesin forcible language to illustrate its lovemoral—“ that there is no object so much a-bove our reach, but maybe attained by Hopeand Courage, guided by Reason, Wit, Ex¬perience, and Skill. The enduring fame ofithis pleasing poetical Allegory is evinced bythe fact of its having been published fromtime to time, in various parts of the country,in a cheap and popular form. But althoughit is understood to have been written atCumston Castle, in the immediate neighbour¬hood of Kirkcudbright, and to describe theromantic scenery of the Dee, no edition ofthe poem has hitherto been published in theSouth of Scotland, and copies of the formereditions have become exceedingly rare.These circumstances have induced theI-.-—PREFACE.Publisher to prepare the present edition,which he has prefixed a Biographical Memof the Author, extracted from ChamberLives of Illustrious and Distinguished Scotcmen. He has also added a selection frothe minor productions of Montgomery, whic]are only to be found in Dr Irving’s Livesthe Scottish Poets, and Sibbald’s Chronic:of Scottish Poetry—works so rare and espensive as to be confined to the hands offew.The orthography of a few of the more oh'solete and antiquated words has been modern!ised ; and notes have been added, drawn fromthe best works on Mythology, explanatory othe Heathen Deities alluded to in the text.A tradition is still current in this neighbourhood, that thiprototypes of the Cherry and the Slab dwelt at a place, yetpointed out, in the parish of Tongland.KI IlICCUDB KIGHT, \APRIL, 1842. JBIOGRAPHICAL MEMOIRTHE AUTHOR.Ai.exander Montgomery, an early poet oficonsiderable fame, appears to have been a youngerson of Montgomery of Hazlehead Castle, in Ayr¬shire, a branch of the noble family of Eglintoime.Me flourished in the reign of James VI., but pro¬bably wrote verses at an antecedent period, as somebf his compositions are transcribed in the Banna-i|;yne Manuscript, which was written in 1568. Theite of his birth—further than that it was upon anaster-day—the place and nature of his education,id the pursuits of his early years, are all involvedobscurity. He is said to have been brought upthe county of Argyle; a fact which seems toither some confirmation from a passage in Demp-er—“ equesMontanus vnlgo vocatus,”—as if heid acquired some common nickname, such as “ theighland trooperfor Montgomery never wasmighted. There is some reason to suppose thate was at one time a domestic or commander in thejuard of the regent Morton. His most familiardtle, “ Captain Alexander Montgomery,’ rendersIt probable that the latter was the nature of hisffice,, for the word Captain seems to have beenrst used in Scotland, in reference to officers inte immediate service of the sovereign. Melville,i his Diary, mentions that when Patrick Adamson’as promoted to the archbishopric of St. Andrews,an event which occurred in the year 1577,) there'as then at court “captain Montgomery, a goodonest man, and the regent’s domestic,” frho, re-oilecting a phrase which the new primate hadeen accustomed to use in his sermons, rein irked.L6LIFE OF THE AUTHOR.to some of his companions, “for as often as it vreported by Mr Patrick, the prophet would mtthis, I never understood what the prophet mettill now.Montgomery appears afterwards to have been)the service of king James, who, in his Itewles aCautelis, published in 1582, quotes some of tpoems of the subject of this memoir. His servicwere acknowledged by a pension of five kundrmerks, chargeable upon certain rents, of the arcbishopric of Glasgow, which was confirmed in 151and again in 1589. Various places throughoScotland are pointed out by tradition, as havibeen the residence of Montgomery, particularthe ruins of Compston Castle, near Kirkcudbrignow involved in the pleasure grounds connectwith the modern mansion of Mr Maitland of Dudrennan. In 1586, the poet commenced a tourthe continent. After his return, he was involv>in a tedious and vexatious lawsuit respecting 1pension, which has drawn from him some severemarks upon the lawyers and judges of that timOf his principal poem, “The Cherry and the Slaethe first known edition was printed by RobeVValdegrave, in 1607. “ The poet appears, frompassage in a memoir of Mure ot Kowallan, hnephew, to have died between-this date and 161“The poems of Montgomery,” says Dr Irvin;“ display an elegant and lively fancy ; and his vesification is often distinguished by a degree ot hamony, which most of his contemporaries were iicapable of attaining.

It is.glily probable that his taste was formed by theiidy of the Italian poets : he has left many son-ts constructed on the regular model, and hisaint conceits seem not unfrequently to betrayir Italian origin. The subject of love, whichis afforded so fertile a theme to the poets of everyje and nation, has furnished Montgomery withmost common and favourite topic for the exer-e ot his talents His most seriousrt is, ‘ The Cherry and the Slae,’ a poem ofjmsiderable length, and certainly of very consider-;le ingenuity The images areAltered even with profusion; and almost everymza displays the vivacity of the author’s mind.I this, as well as in his other productions, Mont-jmery’s illustrations are very frequently and veryppily drawn from the most familiar objects; and.if often applies proverbial expressions, in a veryunted and pleasing manner Theijnuine explanation of the allegory may perhapsi\, that virtue, though of very hard attainment,jlit to be preferred to vice : virtue is representedthe cherry, a refreshing fruit, growing upon a1 tree, and tliat tree rising from a formidable pre-jice ; vice is represented by the sloe, a fruit which|y easily be plucked, but is bitter to the taste.”c The Cherry and the Slae” has longer retainedularity than any other poetical composition ofreign of James VI. It continued to be occa-bally printed, for popular use, till a recent pe-1; and in 1822, this, as well as the other poeticalks of Montgomery, appeared in a very hand-e edition, under the superintendance of Mrvid Laing. Dr Irving contributed to the pub-tion a biographical preface, from which wee chiefly derived the present memoir.THENOTABLE AND ANCIENTII I S T O ROF THECHERRY and the SLAE.Being a young Man's Love and Courtshto two young Girls named by him, the or.the Cherry and the other the Slae; his lo>for the Cherry, and his courtship to tJfelae at the same time.

Sir (quoth he,) and smil’d,Please you me to employ :For I can serve you in your suit.If you please to impire,With wings to flee, and shafts to shootOr flames to set on fire :Make choice then of those then,Or of a thousand things;But crave them, and have them :With that 1 woo’d his wings.xi.What would you give my friend, quoth hTo have these wanton wings to flee,To sport thy sp’rit a while ?Or what gif I should lend thee hereBow, quiver, shafts, and shooting gear,Some body to beguile ;That gear (quoth I) cannot be bought, jYet I would have it fain :What if (quoth he) it cost thee nought.But rendering all again ?His wings then, he brings then.And binds them on my back :Go flee now, quoth he now.And sae my leave I tak.AND THE SLAE.?XII.I sprang up with Cupido’s wings,Wha how and shooting gear resignsTo lend me for a day ;As Icarus with borrow’d flight,I mounted higher than I might,Owre perilous a play :Then forth I drew the double dart.Which sometime shot his mother.Wherewith I hurt my wanton heart.In hope to hurt another ;It hurt me, or burnt me.While either end I handle :Come see now, in me now.The butter-flie and candle.XIII.As she delights into the low,Sae was I browden of my bow.As ignorant as she ;And as she flies while she is fir’d,Sae with the dart that I desir’dMine hand has hurt me too :As foolish Phaeton by suitHis father's car obtain’d ;Sae langed I in Love’s bow to shoot,Not marking what it mean’d;Mair wilful,, than skilful.To flee I was sae fond.Desiring, aspiring,And sae was seen upon’t.3THE CHERRIEXIV.Too late I knew, wha hews too high,The spail shall fall into his eye,Too late I went to schuils,Too late I heard the swallow preach.Too late Experience doth teach.The schuil-master of fails ;Too late to find the nest I seek.When all the birds are flown ;Too late the stable door I steek.When all the steeds are stown tToo late aye, their state aye,All foolish folk espy;Behind sae, they find naeKemead, and sae do I.xv.If I had ripely been advis’d,I had not rashly enterpris’dTo soar with borrow’d pens ;Nor had essay’d the archer craft,To shoot myself with sik a shaft.As reason quite miskens,Frae wilfulness gave me my wound,I had nae force to flee :Then came I graining to the ground.Friend, welcome hame, quoth he,Whare flew ye ? whom slew ye ?Or wha brings hame the booting ?I see now, quoth he now,Ye ha'e been at the shooting.AND THE SLAE.XVI.As scorn comes commonly with skaith,Sae I behov’d to bide them baith ;. Sae staggering was my state.That under cure I got sic check.Which I might not remove nor neck.But eyther stail or mait:Mine agony was sae extreme,I swelt and swoon’d for fear ;But ere I waken’d of my dream.He spoil'd me of my gear:With flight then, on height then.Sprang Cupid in the skies,Forgetting, and settingAt nought, my careful cries.XVII.Sae lang with sight I follow’d him,While baith my dazzled eyes grew dimWith staring on the starns ;Which flew sae thick before my een,Some red, some yellow, blue and greenWhich troubled all my hams.That every thing appeared twaeTo my bamboozled brain ;But lang might I lie looking sae.Ere Cupid came again :Whase thund’ring, with wond’ring,I heard up through the air ;Through cluds sae, he thuds sae,And flew I wist not where.10THE CHERRIEXVIII.Then frae I saw that god was gane,And I in languor left alane,And sair tormented too;Sometime I sighed, while I was sad,Sometime I mus’d, and maist gane mad,I wist not what to do;Sometime I rav’d, half in a rage,As ane into despair,To he oppressed with sic a page,Lord, hut my heart was sair!Like Dido, Cupido,I widdle and I warie,Who reft me, and left me.In sic a feire-farie.XIX.Then felt I Courage and DesireInflame my heart with uncouth fire,To me before unknown :But now nae blood in me remains.Unburnt, unboil’d within my veinsBy Love his bellows blown ;To quench it ere I was devour’dWith sighs I went about:33ut aye the more I strave to smoor t,The baulder it brak out;Ay pressing, but ceasing,'While it might break the bounds.Mine hue sae, forth shew sae.The dolour of my wounds.AND THE SLAE.IIXX.With deadly visage pale and wan,Mair like an Atomy than man,I wither’d clean away:As wax before the fire, I feltMy heart within my bosom melt,And piece and piece decay ;My veins with brangling like to break.My pulse it lap wi’ pith ;Sae fervency did me infect.That I was vex’d therewith :Mine heart aye, did start aye.The fiery flames to flee :Aye houping, through louping,To leap at liberty.XXI.But (O alas !) it was abus’d.My careful corpse kept it inclos’dIn prison of my breast;With sighs so sowpit and ower-set,Like to a fish fast in a net,In dead-thraw undeceast;Wha though in vain she strives by strengthFor to pull out her head ;Which profits nothing at the length.But hast’ning to her dead :With thristing, and wristing,The faster still is she:There I sae, did lie sae.My death advancing tae,12THE CIIERRIE.XXII.The mair I wrestled with the wind,The faster still myself I find,Nae mirth my mind could ease ;Mairpain than I had never nane,I was sae alter’d and owergane,Through drought of my disease;Yet weakly, as I might, I raise.My sight grew dim and dark,I stagger’d at the windlestraes,Nae token I was stark :Baith sightless and mightless,I grew almaist at ance ;In anguish, I languish,With many grievous granes,xxm.With sober pace I did approachHard to the river and the roche.Whereof I spake before :The river sic a murmur made.As to the sea it softly slade.The craig high, stay and shore :Then pleasure did me sae provoke.There partly to repair ;Betwixt the river and the rock.Where hope grew with despair :A tree then, I see then,Of cherries on the braes ;Below too, I saw too,A bush of bitter slaes.AND THE SLAE.13XXIV.The Cherries hang aboon my head,Like twinkling rubies, round and red,Sae high up in the heugh :Whase shadows in the river shewAs graithly glancing as they grew.On trembling twists and teugh ;Which bow’d through burden of the birth.Declining down their tops :lleflex of Phoebus in the FirthNew colour’d all their knops ;With dancing, and glancing,In tyrles as dornick champ;Which streamed, and learned,Through lightness of that lamp,xxv.With earnest eye, while I espyThe fruit betwixt me and the sky,H alf-gate almaist to heaven;The craig sae cumbersome to climb.The tree sae tall of growth and trim.As ony arrow even ;I call’d to mind how Daphne didWithin the laurel shrink,When from Apollo she her hid,A thousand times I think,That tree there, tome there.As he his laurel thought,Aspyring, but tiring.To get that fruit I sought.14THE CHERRLEXXVI.To climb that craig it was nae buit,Let be to press to pull the fruit,In top of all the tree ;I saw nae way whereby to comeBy ony craft to get it clum,Appearandly to me ;The craig was ugly, stay and dreigh.The tree lang, sound and small,I was afraid to climb sae hich,For fear to fetch a fall;Affrayit to say it,I looked up aloft,Whiles minting, whiles stinting,My purpose changed oft.XXVII.Then Dread, with Danger and DespakForbade my minting ony mairTo rax aboon my reach.What! tush (quoth Courage) man, go tcHe is but daft that hath to do,And spares for every speech :For I have oft heard sooth-men say.And we may see’t oursells,That fortune helps the hardy aye.But poltroons aye repells :Then fear nocht, nor hear nocht,Dreid, Danger, nor Despair,To fazards, hard hazardsIs death ere they come there.AND THE SLAB.15XXVIII.Wha speeds, but such as high aspires ?Wha triumphs not but sic as tyresTo win a noble name?Of shrinking what but shame succeeds ?Then do as thou would have thy deedsIn register of fame.I put the case, thou nocht prevail’d,Sae thou with honour die,Thy life, but not thy courage, fail’d,Shall poets pen of thee:Thy name then, from fame then,Shall never be cut aff;Thy grave aye, shall have aye.That honest epitaph.XXIX.What can thou lose when honour lives ?Renown thy virtue aye revives.If valiantly thou end :Quoth Danger, Huly, friend, take heed,Untimeous spurring spills the steed.Take tent what ye pretend.Though Courage counsel thee to climb.Beware thou kep nae skaith;Have thou nae help but Hope and him.They may beguile thee baith.Thysell nowT, may tell now,The counsel of the clerks;"W harethrow yet, I trow yet,Thy breast doth bear the marks.16THE CHERRIEXXX.Burnt bairns with fire the danger dreads,.Sae I believe thy bosom bleeds.Since last that fire thou felt:Besides that, seldom times thou sees.That ever Courage keeps the keysOf knowledge at his belt:Though he bid forward with his guns,Small powder he provides :Be not a novice of that nuns,Wha saw not baith the sides :Fule haste aye, almaist aye,Owresails the sight of some ;Wha huiks not, wha luiks not,What afterward may come.XXXIYet Wisdom wisheth thee to weighThis figure in philosophic,A lesson worth to lear ;Which is, in time for to tak tent,And not when time is past, repent.And buy repentance dear.Is there nae honour after life,Except thou slay thy sell ?Wherefore hath Atropos that knife ? jI trow thou cannot tell.Wha but it, wald cut it,Which Clotho scarce bath spun.Destroying thy joying,Before it be begun.AND THE SLAE.ITXXXII.All owres are repute to be vice,Owre high, owre low, owre rash, owre nice,Owre het, or yet owre cauld;Thou seems unconstant by thy signs,Thy thought is on a thousand things,Thou wots not what thou wald.Let fame her pity on thee pour.When all thy banes are broken ;Yon siae suppose thou think it soure.May satisfy to slockenThy drouth now, of youth now.Which dries thee with desire:Asswage then thy rage man,Foul water quenches fire.XXXIII.What full art thou to die of thirst.And now may quench it gif thou list,Sae easily but pain ?Mair honour is to vanquish ane.Than fight with ten-some and be tane.And owther hurt or slain.The practice is to bring to pass,And not to enterprize;And as good drinking out of glass.As gold in ony wise.I’d rather, have ever,A bird in hand, or tway.Than seeing ten flyingAbout me all the day.18THE CHERRIEXXXIV.Look where thou light before thou louppi;And slip not Certainty for Hope,Wha guids thee but be-guess.Quoth Courage, Cowards take nae cure|To sit with shame, sae they be sure :I like them all the less ;What pleasure purchas’d is but pain,Or honour won with ease ?He will not lie where he is slain,Wha doubts before he dies.For fear then, I hear then,But only ane remead,Which late is, and that is,For to cut aff the head.XXXV.What is the way to heal thy hurt ?What is the way to stay thy sturt ?What means may make thee merry ?What is the comfort that thou craves ?Suppose these sophists thee deceives,Thou know’s it is the Cherrie;Since for it only thou but thirsts,The Slae can be nae buit:In it also thy health consists,And in nae ither fruit.Why quakes thou, and shakes thou ?And studies at our strife ?Advise thee, it lies theeOn nae less than thy life.AND THE SLAB.19XXXVI.Gif any patient would be panc’d,Why should he lowp, when he is lanc’d ?Or shrink, when he is shorn ?For I have heard chirurgeons say,Oft-times deferring of a dayMight not be mend the morn.Tak time in time, ere time be tint.For time will not remain ;What forceth fire out of the flint,But as hard match again ?Delay not, nor fray not,And thou shall see it sae :Sic gets aye, wha sets aye.Stout stamaks to the brae,xxxvn.Though all beginnings be maist hard,The end is pleasant afterward,Then shrink not for a shower;Frae ance that thou thy greening get.Thy pain and travail is forgot,The sweet exceeds the sour.Gae to then quickly, fear not thir.For Hope good hap hath heicht.Quoth Danger, be not sudden, Sir,The matter is of weight.First spy baith, then try baith,Advisement doth nane ill :You may then I say then,Be willful when you will.20THE CHERRIEXXXVIII.But yet to mind the proverb call,Wha uses perils perish shall.Short while their life them lasts,And I have heard (quoth Hope) that heShould never shape to sail the sea,That for all perils casts.How many through despair are dead,That never perils priev’d ?How many also if you readOf lives have we reliev’d ?Wha being even dicingBut Danger have despair’d ;A hunder, I wonderBut thou hast heard declar’d.XXXIXGif we wha hald not up thine heart,Which is the chief and noblest part.Thy wark will not gang weil:Considering these companions canDissuade a silly, simple man.To hazard for his heal.Suppose they have deceived some.Or they and we might meet;They get nae credence whare we come,With any man of sprit :By reason, their

timeThy slewthing doth overshoot ?Alas, man, thy case, man.In ling’ring 1 lament!Go to now, and do now,That Courage be content.XLI.What if melancholy come in,And get a grip ere thou begin ?Then is thy labour lost;For he will bald thee hard and fast.Till time, and place, and fruit be past.And thou give up the ghost:Then shall be grav’d upon the stane.Which on thy grave is laid,Sometime there lived sic a ane,But how shall it be said ?Here lies now, but praise now,Into dishonour’s bed,A coward, as thou art,Wha from his fortune fled.J22THE CHERRIE.XLII.Imagine, man, if thou wert laid,In grave, and syne might hear this said ;Wouldst thou not sweat for shame 7Yes, faith, I doubt not but thou would:Therefore if thou have eyes behold.How they would smoir thy fame.Go to, and make nae mair excuse.Or life and honour lose;And either them or us refuse,There is no other chose :Consider, togetherThat we can never dwell:At length aye, by strength aye.The pultroons we expel.xu IIQuoth Danger, since I understand.That counsel can be nae command,I have nae mair to say ;Except, if that ye think it good.Take counsel yet, ere ye conclude.Of wiser men than they ;They are but rackless, young and rash.Suppose they think us fleit;If of our fellowship ye fash,Gang with them hardly be it:God speed you, they lead you.Wha have not meikle wit;Expel us, ye’ll tell us.Hereafter comes not yet.AND THE

Amen, faid the Wren.Oun Church, of old, was fo right defended.That thro* all Europe her praise was extended;They were not tongue tied, the truth did reveal,The whole counfelof God they did not conceal.But now Mr. John Sincere he is so confin’d,He hath not a preaching can pleasure our mind :And Mr. William Te'.l-trutti he is displac’d,The girdles now us’d are not meet for his waist.Many are banish’d, and pnt from their flat on,i For lake of a ftomach to take their collation:Lord take not thy.presence from us away.The Wren said, Amen, it's trne that ynu say.For now at this time crabbed is the age,And you'h it’s fearful desirous of wage : ,Some are more careful to get a good flipen,>Tl\an they’re of the flock they have got a-keepin,Mr. T)avid Lukewarm, late minister here,Ofcimes receiv’d a broad belt to wear;He has leli desolate his congregation,To be preferr’d to more estimation ;His honours are so highly augmented,That he has forgot what he covenanted.He fwore, when he received the charge,Before his brethren (witnesses large,)t II ]He give his hand to hi* congregation,That death fhould be their first reparation*There’s not a man that marries a wife,And taketh another in time of her life;Tho’ he be a prince, or (he be a queen,That nr.q of adultery cannot be clean.And ye know of adu'Vrous and covetous menWhat Hull be their portion the apostle doth pen.At the last day, account Ihall be craved,Of eveiy pastor what H ck he received:7'o pay all that is lo*t, he will ordain,That can fiiew neither Ikm nor birn.I would all great ones would take tent,That sH iney have wt world’s but lent;And he that uses his talent aright,'His treasure’s better than Caspar’s might.The Lo d with that man was not content,That gave his talent without anualrei!*;He waa committed to prison, you know;Put where ihall they go, has nothing to ihow?I wish each Christian would take painTo gain whh their talent.

our presc ling folks,With Carpu' he had never left his cloak.Our Saviour on earth humbly he wsnt,Healing the fick and impotent;He cured Bartimeut that was blind,The woman that touch’d his hem behind.He healed that man who fick did abide,Eight and thirty years at the pool-side.Some are more blinded fpiritually.Than Bartimeus was fo corporally.Blind folks at this time are carried away,Like hawk* with tlhodi in a windy day ;Became their deeds they are not right,ThejfTove the darkness more than light: >Remaining in their blind deceit,They never fetk Christ to open their eyes, SSome have the woman’s infirmities, >Tho’ they have not her fidelities. jThis world hath them fo bewitch’d,Christ's garments t?.ey have never touch’d.Some live forty years, and feme threescore,Into this world, in fpirnual fore;They never fetk Christ into them,Until their glass it do oin-run them !Hrppy are they that with contrition,In time feeks to that blest Physician,Who can both foul and body cure.The Wren raid, Amen, for that is fare.C 15 3The Fountain of Life, and Grice-beginner,Delighteth not in the death of any Tinner;Desiring ail men for to repent,In time, before their glass be fpent:I think his blessed word fo kind,Should never go out of their mind.Who graciously laid, Come to me,All ye that wearied and loaden be.For all the gracious Tweet inviting.Men giv him but a fimple meeting.Some indeed do, for example.As the Pharisee, come to the temple,Standing and praying, thanking God then,That he was not like other men; ^Gave aims, fasted twice in the week:’Twas all good he of himself did Tpeak,Payed tithes of all that he poss.e$t;His own righteousness he thus confest.He thanked God he was not a man,Even like unto the publican !The publican was in another case,He fmote hi* breast, fell on his face,Saying, Lord, let thy mercy to me be given.Whose eyes not worthy to lock up to'heaven.*.Vhich cf the two was hidden the best?The one denied, the other confest.Truth calleth him happiest went on his kneesTo Christ, for to cure his.Tmful disease.Few at this litne are weay' and loaden,Except it be with rost and Todden;The cup that makes them most to flTnk,It is a cup of o’er sea drink ;When they with it confer at night,At morn their Itomach is not right,Until they get an augmentationOf liquor, for to cure their passion.£ 16 ]A multitude, for a neighbour’s inviting,They will go to a drunken race ing;But when they are invited by Christ,To ease their burden, few keep tryst!Because of it they have no feeling.They think it better to fpend a IhillingIn the ale-house with their mate,Altho’ they Ihould ftay ne’er fo late.A blind man he doth fow no feed,Thy life is but a feckless threed;If thou with drink get in a furfeir,A Cudden death may come and cut it:If thou with drink go to the clay,Thou’lt rise with fliame at the last day !The Saints will fee your lhaineful rife,You must appear without disguise ;They’ll fay, Behold yon drunken fellow iCups hath nude him very mellow jSee how the drink hath made him doilM,His wedding-garment’s all befoil'd llie fliould go hide him out of fight,The fellow hath been drunk o’er nifcht.0 ! if that men in company,Kemembcr would eternity,Where there is either pleasure or pain !O! that is true, Sir, hid the Wren.This time could I be but liberat,Here from the dangc.^bf the cat,I’dTpeak tiil I'd weary my tongue and dunkAltho’ I Ihould r*t little thanks;1 he love of God dors me constrain,To fpeak the truth l fear no manThere fliould no pastor in this fun Ton,Be tied unco Rtan’t injunction ;r *71Min, fpesk truth frc’ly'fr m thy heart, 'And i.evrc t om the fam' depart;

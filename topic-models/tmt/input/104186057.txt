waves were white, and red the morn,In the noisy hour when I was born ;And the whale it whistled, the porpoise rolled.And the Dolphins hared their backs of gold;And never was heard such an outcry wild,As welcomed to life the Ocean child.I have lived, since then, in calm and strife.Full fifty Glimmers a rover’s life,With wealth to spend, and a power to range.But never have sought or sighed for change :And death, whenever he comes to me.Shall come on the wide unbounded Sea.SLEEPING MAGGIE.Muut an’ rainy is the night.No a stain in a’ the carry,Lightnings gleam athwart the lift,And winds drive

rich glowing rallies are sounding with gladne*!And each toiling peasant sweet plenty beholds.O come, ye Spartans ! tho’ dreary the prospect,Come, for our cfci'dren demand no delay;Arouse ! or our country will fall into ruins.And grim-eyed oppression will hail the dark day.Then rally, ye Grecians—thy chiefs, O famed Luctra !Still gaze on onr sons, though enwrapt with a diah> }Arouse ! from thy fetters, fair land of the sages,And boast, not of famous hncargus in rain.■st.-nma-CONTENTSThe Rose of Allaudale,Heaving the Lead, - - . .Hearts of Oak, ....The Lass o’ Gowrie,Farewell to Aberfoyle,My

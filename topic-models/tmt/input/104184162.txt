Sketch of the author,In a preface to an edition of the works of John Burness, dated Stonehaven,May i8ig, the writer gives the following account of the author:—JohnBurness was the youngest son of William Burness, Farmer in Bogjordan,Parish of Glenbervie, and County of Kincardine. He was born on the23rd of May, 1771. He lost both his parents before he had attained histhirteenth year, and never was but one year at any school.He served his apprenticeship to the baker business in Brechin, at whichtrade he worked till about the latter end of 1794, when he enlisted in theAngus Fencible Volunteer Corps of Infantry, then raising in Arbroath, andcommanded by Major John Fraser of Balmadus. With this corps he wasat Dumfries in the year 1796, where he got acquainted with his relation,Robert Burns. Here he wrote his tale of “ Thrummy Cap,” which wasshown to Burns a little before his death. The corps to which the authorwas attached, subsequently went to Stranraer in Galloway where he wrote“Charles Montgomery.” They afterwards embarked for the ShetlandIsles, where “ Rosmond and Isabella ” was written.Upon the disbanding of the corps at Peterhead, 1st April, 1799, he cameto Stonehaven, where he commenced business for himself as a baker. Herehe first published his “ Charles Montgomery.”Matters not answering his expectations in Stonehaven, he gave upbusiness, and engaged himself as a substitute in the Forfar Militia; andwith them he continued till the 10th of June, 1815, when he was dischargedat Naas, in the county of Kildare, Ireland, when he once more returned toStonehaven and attempted the baker business, but was still unsuccessful.The Author’s fate was a sad one. In 1826 while engaged at his employ¬ment as a Book Canvasser, and probably selling his own publications, hewas overtaken by a snow-storm near the Kirk of Portlethen and perished.He was buried in the Spital Cemetery, Aberdeen.Burness was a second-cousin of Robert Burns, whose father, WilliamBurness, was born near Stonehaven. The forefathers of the two poets areburied in the churchyard of Glenbervie, where a tombstone is erected totheir memory.Burness was best known as the author of “ Thrummy Cap,” but he hada very varied Muse, writing plays in blank verse and in prose ; also tales,tragic and humorous; songs, etc. “ Thrummy Cap” and “The Ghaist o’Garron Ha’ ” were his most popular works. Burns is said to have con¬sidered “Thrummy Cap” the best ghost story in the language.THRUM MYCAP.“A Tale o' Ihe tunes that are past.The deeds o' the day that are gane,Fan goblins, abroad i' the blast,At midnight made horrible mane.Fan knowledge, in cloisters confin'd,Was kept by the clerical crew.The people, priest-ridden an' blind.Believ'd sic absurdities true."The Lamb Leader.In ancient times, far in the north,A hunder miles ayont the Forth,Upon a stormy winter’s day,Twa men forgather’d by the way ;An’ as they had some piece to gang,To keep the time frae seeming lang,They did agree to gang thegither,As company to ane anither.Ane was a sturdy bardoch chiel,An’ frae the weather happit weelWi’ a mill’d plaiden jockey coat;An’ eke, he on his head had gotA Thrummy Cap, bait large and stout,W’ flaps ahint (as weel’s a snout),Whilk buttoned close aneath his chin,To keep the cauld frae cummin’ in ;4Upon his legs, he had gamashes,Which sogers ca’ their spatterdashes ;An’ on his hands, instead o’ glo’es,Large doddy mittens, whilk he’d rooseFor warmness; an’ an aiken stick,Nae very lang, but gey an’ thick,Intil his neive, he drove awa,’An’ car’d for neither frost nor sna.’The tither was just the reverse,O’ claise an’ courage baith was scarce ;Sae in our tale, as we go on,I think we’ll ca’ him Cow’rdly John,As he that spirit aft did show,As in the sequel you will know.Sae on they gaed at a guid scour,’Cause that they saw a gatherin’ show’rGrow vera thick upo’ the wind,Whilk to their wae they soon did findAn awfu’ show’r o’ sna and drift,As ever dang down frae the lift.Right wild and monstrous Boreas roar’d,“Preserves !” quo John, “we’ll baith be smoor’d,Our tryst’s end we can ne’er mak out.”“ Cheer up,” quo Thrummy, “ never doubt;But I’m some fley’d we’ve tint our way.Howe’er at the neist house we’ll stayUntil we see gin it grows fair ;Gin no, a’ nicht we’ll tarry there.”“ Weei, weel,” says Johnny, “ we sail try.”Syne they a mansion-house did spyUpo’ the road, a bit afore,Sae up they gaed unto the door,Whare Thrummy chappit wi’ his stick,Syne to the door cam vera quickA muckle dog, wha barkit sair ;5But Thrummy for him didna care,But handled weel his aiken staff,In spite o’’s teeth he kept him affUntil the landlord cam to seeAn’ ken what might the matter be.Whan vera soon the dog did cease,The landlord he did spier the case.Quo’ Thrummy, “ Sir, we hae gaen will,We thocht we’d ne’er a house get till;We near were smoor’d amang the drift,An’ sae, guidman, ye’ll mak a shiftTo gie us quarters a’ this night,For now we dinna hae day-lightFarer to gang, though it were fair—Sae gin ye hae a bed to spare,Whate’er your charge we sanna grudge,An’ satisfy you ere we budgeTo gang awa, and when it’s dayWill pack our awls an’ tak our way.”The landlord says—“ O’ beds we’ve nane,Our ain fouk they will scarce contain;But gin ye’ll gang but twa miles forit,Aside the kirk dwalls Robbie Dorat,Wha keeps a change, an’ sells guid drink.His house you may mak out, I think.”Quo’ Thrummy—“ That’s owre far awa’,The roads are sae blawn up wi’ snaw,To mak it is nae in our power,For, look ye, sic a dismal showerIs cornin’ on : ye’ll lat us bide,Though we sude sit at your fireside.”The landlord says to him—•“ Na, na,I canna keep you here ava.Shamp aff, it is nae worth your whileTo bide, fan ye hae scrimp twa mile6To gang; sae quickly aff ye’ll steerFor faith I doubt ye’s nae be here.”“ Twa miles,” quo’ Thrummy, “de’il speed meIf frae your house this night I gae.Are we to starve in Christian land ?As lang’s my stick bides i’ my hand,An’ siller plenty i’ my pouch,To nane about this house I’ll crouch.Come, John, lat’s in we’ll tak a seat.Fat sorrow gars you look so blate ? ”Sae in he gaes an’ sets him down,Says he—“ There’s nane about your tounSail put me out till a new day,As lang’s I’ve siller for to pay.”The landlord says—“ Ye’re rather rash,To turn you out we sanna fashSince ye’re sae positive to bide,But troth ye’ll sit by the fireside.I tauld you ance, o’ beds I’ve naneUnoccupied, except bare anejIn it, I dread, ye winna lie,For stoutish hearts ha’e aft been shyTo venture e’en within the roomAfter the night begins to gloom ;It’s haunted by a frightfu’ ghaist.Oursel’s are terrified amaistTo bide about the toun a’ night;Sae ye may chance to get a sight,Like that whilk some o’ our folk saw;Far better till ye gang away,Or else ye’ll maybe rue ere day.”“ Guid faith,” quo’ John, “ I’m thinkin’ sae.Better intil the neuk to sitThan fley’d, guid keeps ! out o’ our wit.The Lord preserve me frae a’ evil!I7AI wadna like to see the Devil.”“ Whist, gouk,” quo Thrummy, “ baud your peace,That sauna gar me leave this place;To great or sma’ I ne’er did ill,Nae ghaist or de’il my rest shall spill.Landlord, gin ye’ll mak up that bed,I promise I’ll be vera gladIntil the same a’ night to lie,Gin that the room be warm an’ dry.”The landlord says—“ Ye’se get a fireAn’ candle too, gin ye desire,Wi’ beuks to read, an’ for your bedI’ll orders gie to get it made.”John says—“As I’m a Christian man,Wha never lik’d to curse nor ban,Nor steal nor lie, nor drink nor splore,I’ll never gang within the door,But stay by the fireside a’ night,An’ gang awa whene’er it’s light.”Says Thrummy till him, wi’ a glower,“Ye cowardly gouk—I’ll mak ye cour !Come ye up stairs alang wi’ me,An’ I sail caution for you be,For I defy the muckle de’ilAn’ a’ his warks I wat fu’ weekFat tarry then maks you sae eery ?Fling by your fears and come be cheery.”Syne Johnny faintly gae consent,An’ up the stairs they quickly went,Where soon they gat baith fire an’ lightTo keep them hearty a’ the night.The landlord likewise gae them meatAs muckle as they weel could eat,Shaw’d them their bed, and bade them gangTill it whene’er they did think lang.8Sae wishin’ them a good repose,Straight then to his ain bed he goes.Our travellers now being left alane,’Cause that the frost was nippin’ keen,Coost aff their shoon an’ warm’t their feet,An’ syne gaed to their bed to sleep;But cowardly John wi’ fear was quakin’,He couldna sleep but lay still wakin’,Sae troubled wi’ his panic fright.Whan near the twalt hour o’ the night,That Thrummy waken’d, and thus spoke :“ Preserve’s !” quo’ he, ‘'‘I’m like to chokeWi’ thirst, an’ I maun ha’e a drink ;I will gae down the stairs, I think,An’ grapple for the water pail;0 ! for a waught o’ caller ale ! ”But Johnny says to him, “ Na, na,1 wanna lat ye gang awa ;Wow ! will you gang and leave me hereMy lane, to die wi’ perfect fear ? ”“ Rise and gae wi’ me then,” quo’ Thrummy,“Ye senseless guid-for-naething bummy.I’m only gaun to seek some water,An’ I’ll be back just in a clatter.”“Na, na,” says John, “I’ll rather lie ;But as I’m likewise something dry,Gin ye can get a jug or cap,Fetch up to me a little drap.”“Aye, aye,” says Thrummy, “that I will,Although you sudna get a gill.”Sae down he gaes to seek a drink,An’ syne he thinks he sees a blinkO’ light, that shone upo’ the floor,Out through the keyhole o’ a door,Whilk was nae fast, but stood ajee;49Whatever’s there he thinks he’ll see.He bauldly o’er the threshold ventures,An’ in within the cellar enters.But, reader, judge o’ his surprise,When there he saw, with wond’ring eyes,A spacious vault, weel filled wi’ casksO’ reamin’ ale, an’ some big flasks.An’ strideleg o’er a cask o’ aleHe saw the likeness o’ himsel’,Just i’ the dress that he coost aff:A thrummy cap, and aiken staff,Gamashes, an’ a jockey coat,An’ in its hand the ghaist had gotA big four-luggit timmer bicker,Filled to the brim wi’ reamin’ liquor.Our hero at the spectre star’d,But neither daunted was nor feared.He to the ghaist straight up did step,An’ says, “ Dear brother Thrummy Cap,The warst ye surely dinna drink,I’ll try the same o’ yours, I think.”Syne taks a jug, pu’s out the pail,An’ fills it up o’ the same aleFrae under where the spectre sat,An’ up the stairs wi’ it he gat,Took a good drink, gied John anither,But never tauld him o’ his brither,That he into the cellar saw,Mair than he’d naething seen ava.Right brown and nappy was the beer,“ Whare did you get it ? ” John did spier.Says he, “ I’m sure you needna care ;I’ll gae an’ see to get some mair.”Sae down the stairs again he goesTo get a drink, anither dose,10Being positive to hae some mair,But still he found the ghaist was there,Now on a butt, behind the door.Says he, “ You did nae ill afore,Dear brither Thrummy, sae I’ll tryYou ance again, because I’m dry.”Syne fills his jug right out below,An’ up the stair again does go.John marvell’d sair, but didna spierAgain whare he had got the beer ;For this was stronger than the first,Sae they baith drank till like to burst,An’ syne composed themsel’s to rest,To sleep a while they judged it best.An hour in bed they hadna been,An’ scarcely weel had closed their een,Whan just into the neighbouring cham’erThey heard a dreadfu’ din and clamour.Aneath the bed-claise John did cour,But Thrummy jumpt upo’ the floor.Him by the sark-tail John did baud :“ Lie still,” quo’ he, “ fat, are ye mad ? ”Thrummy then turned him round aboutAn’ lent John in the ribs a clout,Till on the bed he tumbled downIn little better than a swoon;While Thrummy, as fast’s he could rin,Gaed aff to see what made the din.The chamber seem’d to him as lightAs if the sun was shining bright;The ghaist was standing near the doorIn the same dress it had before,An’ o’er anent it, at the wa’,Were ither apparitions twa!These spirits seem’d to kick a ba’,The ghaist against the ither twa ;Whilk dose they drave baith back an’ foreAtween the chirala’ an’ the door.Thrumray a while beheld the play,Syne rinnin’ up, he this did say—“ Ane for ane may weel compare,But twa for ane is rather sair ;The play’s nae equal, say, I vow,Dear brither Thrummy, I’ll help you.”Syne wi’ his fit he kicked the ba’,Gar’d it play slot against the wa’.Quick then as lightning frae the skyThe spectres ga’e a horrid cryAn’ vanished in a clap o’ thun’er,While Thrummy at the same did won’er.The room was quiet noo an’ mirk,An’ Thrummy, stilping in his sark,Glaumpin’ the gate back to his bed,He thinks he hears a person tread,An’ ere he gat without the doorThe ghaist again stood him afore,An’ in his face did starin’ stan’Wi’ a big can’le in its ham’Quo’ Thrummy, “ Frien’, I want to knowWhat brings ye frae the shades below.I in my Maker’s name commandYe’ll tell yer story just aff-hand.Fat wad ye hae ?—I’ll do my bestFor you, to lat you be at rest.”Then says the ghaist, “ ’Tis forty yearSince I’ve been doomed tae wander here;In a’ that time there has been naneBehaved sae bold as ye have deen ;Sae if you’ll do a job for meDisturbance mair I’ll never gie,”12“ Sae on your tale,” quoth Thrummy, “ ITo do you justice sure will try.”“ Then mark me well,” the ghaist replied,“An’ ye shall soon be satisfied.Frae this aback near fifty yearI of this place was overseer,Whan this laird’s father had the landA’thing was then at my command,Wi’ power to do as I thought fit,In ilka cause I chief did sit.The Laird paid great respect to me,But I an ill return did gie:The title deeds o’ his estateOut o’ the same I did him cheat,An’ staw them frae where they did lieSome days afore the laird did die.His son at that time was in France,An’ sae I thought I’d hae some chance,Gif he should never come again,That the estate would be my ain.But scarcely three bare weeks were pastWhen death did come and grip me fast,Sae sudden that I hadna powerThe charters back for tae restore.Soon after that hame cam the heir,An’ syne got up the reefu’ rair—What sorrow was come o’ the rights ?He sought them several days an’ nights,But never yet ha’e they been seen,As I aneath a muckle staneDid hide them i’ this cham’er wa’,Weel sew’d up in a leather ba’;But I was ne’er allowed to restUntil that I the same confess ;But this to do I hadna pow’ri3Frae yon time tae this vera hour,That I’ve reveal’d it a’ tae you ;An noo I’ll tell you what tae do—Till nae langsyne nae mony kentThat this same laird the rights did want,But noo they hae him at the law,An’ the neist ook the laird maun shawAfore the court, the rights o’’s lan’,This puts him tae an unco stan’,For if he disna shaw them thereO’ a’ his lands he’ll be stript bare;Nae hope has he to save his ’state,This maks him sour and unco blate.He canna think whar’s rights may be,An’ ne’er expects them mair to see.But noo, my frien’, mark what I tell,An’ ye’ll get something tae yersel’:Tak oot that stane there in the wa’,An’ there you’ll get the leather ba’.’Tis just the same that ye did see,When you said that ye would help me.The rights are sew’d up in its heart;But see you dinna wi’ them partUntil the laird shall pay you downJust fifty guineas an’ a crown,Whilk at my death was due tae me.This for thy trouble I’ll gi’e thee,An’ I’ll disturb this hoose nae mair,’Cause I’ll be free frae a’ my care.”This Thrummy promised tae do,An’ syne the ghaist bade him adieu,An’ vanish’d wi’ a pleasant soondBoon thro’ the laft an’ thro’ the ground.Thrummy gaed back syne tae his bedAn’ cowardly John was very gladThat he his neighbour saw ance mair,For o’ his life he did despair.“ Wow man,” quo’ John, whare hae ye been ?Come tell me a’ fat ye have seen.”“ Na, bide,” says Thrummy, “ till daylight,I’ll tell ye syne, baith clear an’ right.”Sae down they lay an’ took a napUntil the ninth hour it did chap.Whan John was sleepin’ Thrummy raise,An’ to the cham’er aff he gaes,Taks the big stane frae out the wa’,An’ soon he fand the leather ba’,Took out the rights, replaced the stane,Ere John weel kent whare he had been.Syne baith cam stappin doon the stair.The morning noo was calm an’ fair.“ Weel, says the Laird, “ my trusty frien’,Hae ye ought in our cham’er seen ? ”Quo’ Thrummy, “Sir, I naething sawThat did me ony ill ava.”“ Weel,” quo’ the Laird, “ ye noo may gang,Ye ken the day’s naevera lang;In the meantime it’s calm an’ clear,Ye lose your time in biding here.”Quo’ Thrummy, “ Sir, mark what I tell,I’ve mair right here than you yoursel’,Sae till I like I here shall bide.”The Laird at this began tae chide.Says he, “Myfriend, your turnin’ rude,”Quo’ Thrummy, “ I’ll my claim mak guid,For I just here afore you a’The Rights o’ this Estate can shaw,An’ that is mair than ye can do.”“ What!” quo’ the Laird, “ can that be true ?”“ ’Tis true,” quo’ Thrummy, “ look an’ see—4-15D’ye think that I wad tell a lie ? ”The parchment frae his pouch then drew,An doon upo’ the table threw.The Laird at this up tae him ran,An’ cried, “ Whar did ye get them, man ?”Syne Thrummy tald him a’ the tale,As I’ve tald you, baith clear an’ hale.The Laird at this was fidgin’ fainThat he wad get his rights again ;An’ fifty guineas down did tell,Besides a present frae himsel’.Thrummy him thanked, and syne the gowdIntil a muckle purse he stow’d,An’ cramm’d it in his oxter pouch,An’ syne sought oot his aiken crutch ;“ Now, fare-ye-well, I maun awa’,An’ see gin I get through the sna\”“ Weel, fare-ye-well,” replied the Laird.“ But hoo comes it ye haena shar’dOr gien yer neibor o’ the money ? ”“Na, by my saul I, Sir,” quo’ Thrummy,“ When I this siller sair did win,To share wi’ him wad be a sin ;Afore that I the ghaist had laidThe nasty beast had   the bed.”An’ sae my tale I here do end.I hope no one it will offend.My Muse will nae assist me langer,The dorty jade sometimes does anger;I thought her ance a gay smart lass,But now she’s come till sic a passThat a’ my cudgelling an’ whippingWill hardly wake her out o’ sleepin’.To plague her mair I winna try,But dight my pen and lay it by.

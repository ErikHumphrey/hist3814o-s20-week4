flan^wnd a clumsy oak cudgel he gripped,,9ii purpose the loons for to bangLilt te turan an uran &'C,3Now Willock and Tam geyan bouzy,in nude litre did meet wi, their joes.Consented wi’ Cibbie and Shusyto gang awa down to the shows;There was the fiddlin and drumminga crowd they could scarcely get throughfiddles trumpets and Organs a bumming,_^0, Sirs what a hull) balooLilt te turan an uran &e.Then hie to the tents at the paling,weel theekit wi’ blankets and mats,Deals seated round like a taproom,supporaed on stones and on pats,The whisky like water they’re sellingand porter as sma’ as their yill.And aye as jou're pourin’ they’re tellin’,troth dear it's just sixpence the gill.Lilt te turan an uran &c.Says Meg see yon beast wi’ the claes on‘twi the face o'tas black as the sootPresc

Dunkeld.and o what, <Src.A beauty I did grow.When I was a little boy,some fifteen years ago,1 was the pride of my mamma,lord she made me quite a showSuch a beauty I did grow.I d red straight hair and gogg!e-eand such a roguish leer ;A large flat nose and mouthth t reached frtm ear to ea jyuch a beauty l d;d grow.6My mammy doated on me,and when my mouth she d fillFor fear she d sp oil it with a spoon,she fed me with a quid,Such a beauty I did grow.And when that I could run alone,stock fast I never stoodThe ducks were my companionsas l waddled through the mudSuch a beauty I did grow.Then learned to be musical,and got of songs so pat,I could grunt bass like any pig,mew treble like a catSuch a beauty I did grow.Then 1 went to the dancing school,for to be finished there,And they said I danced a minuetas graceful as a bear ;duel beauty I did grow.With a mountebank a candidate'I beat them all quite hollow.And I won this pretty gold laced hatby rinning through a collarSuch a beauty I did grow.My name is Tommy Herring,asevery body knows,And they stick me in ihe barley fields,to frighten off the crows.Adventures of a Shilling.By a poor toilling wretch who each hour lifebewailf d,Brought to light I made part of a dollar ;Near to spain by a few brittish broadsides washailed,and g'ven to reward a tars valour,Jack gave me to Poll when all dollars being stop dTo a Jew 1 er for ear-rings me selling.Slap ihto a^crucible poor I was p ptand then stamped a beautiful shilling.A So'dier who d long been abroad at the wars,had been wounded long sick and confinedThe all that remained were bis honored scars,not a stiver his pockets now lined.An old comrade beholding his face soon did gueswhat his brave fiend with hunger was (eeiirgMost cheerful did give him the half of his messand shared with him me his last shi ling.I long was admir'd by a kind-hearted Faif,who f’eit pity and gave me to shew it.To the young helpless children and wife with atear,of a poor distrest haif-starviug Poet.Tho' with love for his fami'y his feeling heart bledthis son of the Mu-es tho willing,Couldnu get for his children a morsel of bread,till relieved by fair Charity's Shilling.In a Pawn-broker's shop, I next morning wasplac d ,where ad roguery he practis d dailyTill at last caught receiving lie paid me in hasteto save his neck at the old Bailey.Next a fat rosy son of the church did me bear,who of charity ever was tedingBut tho often assail'd by pale Penury's fear,could deny the small boon of a Shilling.With all ranks and degrees I have taken abode,tho' with Merit i‘d seldom a lodging ;I have brib'd at Elections, been ta eo on theRoad.from hand to hand constantly trudging.At last an old coimng. sly rogue of a Jew,without either mercy or feeling.In a pot of base metal, to mend u me threw ;thus ending the days of the Shilling.

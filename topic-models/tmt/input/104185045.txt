Every body ki.ows, that the ladies in Spainin certain cases, do not give long warning to prac¬titioners of a certain description, and nobody knewit better than Nicolas, who was resolved not tolose an inch of his way, nor of his mule's best speedby the way, if cudgelling could beat it out of her.It was plain to Nicolas's conviction, as plain couldbe, that bis road lay straight forward to the lit¬tle convent in front; the mule was of opinion,that the turning on the left down the hill towardsthe Pradc, was the road of all roads most fami¬liar and agreeable to herself, and accordingly be¬gan to dispute the point of topography with Ni¬colas, by fixing her forefeet very resolutely in theground, dipping her head at the sjme time be¬tween them, and launching her heels and crupperfuriously into the air, in the way of argument.Little Pedrosa, who was armed at the heel with onemassy silver spur, of stout though ancient work¬manship, resolutely applied the rusty rowel to3the shoulder of the beast, and at the same time,adroitly tucking his blue cap under his right arm,and flinging his skirt over his shoulder en cavalier,began to lay lustily about him with a stout ashensapling, upon the ears, pole, and cheeks, of therecreant mule. The fire now fiashed from apair of Andalusian eyes, as black os charcoal, andnot less inflammable, and taking the segara fromhis mouth, with which he had vainly hoped tohave regaled his nostrils in a sharp winter’s even¬ing by the way, raised such a thundering troopof angels, saints, and martyrs, from Saint Michaeldownwards,—not, however, forgetting his ownnamesake St. Nicolas de Tolentino, by the way,that if curses could have made the mule go, thedispute would have been soon ended ; but not asaint could make, her stir a bit any other waysthan upwards and downwards at a stand. A smalltroop of mendicant friars were at this momentconducting the host to a thing man.—“ NicolasPedrosa,” said an old friar, “ be patient with yourbeast, and spare your blasphemies ; rememberBalaam.”—“ Ah! father,” n plied Pedrosa, “ Ba¬laam cudgelled bis beast till she spoke, so will Imine till she roars.”—“ Fie, fie, prophane fellow,”cries another of the fraternity. “ Go about yourwork, friend,” quoth Nicolas, “and let me goabout mine; I warrant it is the more pressing ofthe two ; your patient is going out of the world,and mine is coming into it.” “ Hear him,” cries athird, “hear the vile wretch how he blasphemes thebody of God. ’ And then thr troop passed slowly'on to the tinkling of the bell.A man must know' nothing of a mule’s ears,4who does not know what a passion they have forthe tinkling of a bell ; and no sooner had thejingling chords vibrated in the sympathetic or¬gans of Pedrosa’s beast, than bolting forwardwith a sudden, spring site ran roaring into thethrong of friars, trampling on some, and shoul¬dering others, at a prophane rate; when Nicolasavailing himself of the impetus, and perhaps notable to control it, broke away, and was out ofsight in a moment. ‘ All the devils in hell blowfire into thy tail, thou beast of Babylon, mntteredNicolas to himself, as he scampered along, neveronce looking behind him, or stopping to apologizefor the mischief he had done to the bare feet andshirtless ribs of the holy brotherhood.Whether Nicolas saved his distance, as like¬wise if he did, whether it was a male or a fe¬male Castilian he ushered into the world, weshall not just now enquire, contented to awaithis return in the first of the morning, next day,when he had no sooner dismounted at his shop,and delivered his mule to a sturdy Arragonesewench, than Don Ignacia de Santos Aparicio,Alguazil-mayor of the supreme and general In¬quisition, put an order into his hand, signed andsealed by the Inquisitor-general, for a convey¬ance of his body to the Casa, uhose formidabledoor piesents itself in the street adjoining to thesquare in which Nicolas’s brazen basin hung from,the emblem of his trade.The pocr little fellow, trembling in every joint,and with a face as yellow as saffron, dropt a kneeto the alter which fronts the entrance, and cros¬sed himself most devoutly : as soon as he had as-5centled the first flight of stairs, a porter habitedin black opened the tremendous barricade, andNicolas with horror, heard the grating of theheavy bolts that shut him in. He was ledthrough passages and vaults, and melancholycells, till he was delivered into the dungeon,where he was finally left to bis solitary medita¬tions. Hapless being ! what a scene of horror !Nicolas felt all the terrors of his condition, butbeing an Andalusian, and, like his countrymen,of a lively imagination, he began to turn over allthe resources of his invention for some happyfetch, if any such might occur, for helping himout of the dismal limbo be was in : he had notlong to seek for the cause of his misfortune; hisadventure with the barefooted friars was a readysolution of all difficulties of that nature, had therebeen any; there was. however, another thing,which might have troubled a stouter heart thanNicolas’s—be was a Jew. This, of a certain,would have been a staggering item in a poordevil’s confession, but then it was a secret to allthe world but Nicolas, and Nicolas’s consciencedid not then urge him to reveal it. He now be¬gan to overhaul the inventory of his personalsabout him, and with some satisfaction countedthree little medals of the blessed Viigin, twoAgnus Deis, a Saint Nicolas de Tolentino, anda formidable string of beads, all pendant fromIns neck, and within his shirt; in his pockets hehad a paper of dried figs, a small bundle of se-gars, a case of lancets, squirt and forceps, andtwo old razors in a leathern envelope: these hehad delivered one by one to the algunzil, who*****6first arrested him,—‘ and let them make the mostof them,” said he to himself, “ they can neverprove an Israelite by a case of razors.” Upon acloser rummage, however, he discovered in asecret pocket, a letter, which the Alguazil hadoverlooked, and which his patient Donna Leon¬ora de Casafonda had given him in charge to de¬liver as directed.—‘Well well,’cried he, ‘let itpass; there can be no mystery in this harmlessscrawl; a letter of advice to some friend or rela¬tion ; I’ll not break the seal ; let the fathers readit, if they like, ’twill prove the truth of my de¬position, and help out my excuse for the hurry ofmy errand, and the unfortunate adventure of adamned refractory mule.’—-And now no soonerhad the recollections of the wayward mule cros¬sed the brain of poor Nicolas Pedrosa, than hebegan to blast her at a furious rate. ‘ The scrat¬ches and the scab to boot confound thy scurvyhide/ quoth he, ‘ thou d—d ass-begotten bastard,whom Noah never let into his ark ! The ven¬geance take thee, for an uncreated barren beastof promiscuous generation ! What devil’s crot¬chet got int6 thy capricious noddle, that thoushouldst fall in love with that Nazaritish bell,and run bellowing like Lucifer into the midst ofthose barefooted vermin, who are more maliciousand more greedy than the locusts of Egypt ? Oh,that 1 had the art of Simon Magnus to conjurethee into this dungeon in my stead,—but I war¬rant thou art chewing thy barley straw withoutany pity for thy wretched master, whom thy jade’stricks have delivered over bodily to the tormen¬tors, to be sport for these uiicircumciscd sons of7Dagou.’ And now the cell door opened, when asavage figure entered, carrying a huge parcel ofclanking fetters, with a collar of iron which he putfirmly round the neck of poor Pedrosa, telllinghim, with a truly diabolical grin, whilst he wasrivetting it on, ‘ that it w'as a proper cravat forthe throat of a blasphemer.’—‘ Jesus Maria ! quothPedrosa, ‘ is all this fallen upon me for only cud¬gelling a restive mule?” ‘Aye,’ exclaimed thedemon, ‘and this is only a taste of what is tocome,’ at the same time slipping the pincers fromthe screw he was forcing to the head, he caughta piece of flesh in the forceps, and wrenched itout of his cheek, laughing at poor Nicolas, whilstho roared out with pain, telling him that ‘ it wasa just reward for the torture he had put him toa while ago, when he tugged out a tooth till hebroke it in his jaw.’ ‘ Ah, for the love of heaven,’cried the unfortunate Pedrosa, ‘have more pity onme ; for the sake of Saint Nicolas de Tolentino,my holy patron, be not so unmerciful to a poorbarber-surgeon ; and I will shave your worship’sbeard for nothing as long as I have life.’ One ofthe messengers of the auditory now came in andbade the scoundrel strike of the prisoner’s fetters,for that the holy fathers were in council, and de¬manded him for examination. ‘ This is somethingextraordinary,’ quoth the the tormentor, ‘ l shouldnot have expected it this twelvemonth to come.’Pedrosa’s fetters were instantly struck off; somebrandy was applied to staunch the bleeding of hischeek ; his hands and face were washed, and ashort jacket of coarse ticking thrown over him;and the messenger, with an assistant, taking him8reach under an arm, led him into a spacious cham¬ber, where at the head of a long table sat his ex¬cellency the Inquisidor-general, with six of his as¬sessors, three on each side of the chair of state;the Alguazil-mayor, a secretary, and two notaries,with Oliver officers of the holy council, were at¬tending in their places.The prisoner was placed behind a bar at thefoot of the table, between the messengers whobrought him in ; and having made his obesianceto the awful presence, in the most supplicatingmanner, he was called upon, according to theusual form of question, by one of the juniorjudges, to dec'are hi« name, parentage, profes¬sion, age, place of abode, and to answer variousinterrogatories, of the like trifling nature : his Ex¬cellency the Inquisidor-general now opened hisreverend lips, and in a solemn tone of voice, thatpenetrated to the heart of the poor trembling pris¬oner, interrogated him as follows :Nicolas Pedrosa, we have listened to the ac¬count you give of yourself, your business, and con¬nections : now tell us for what offence or offen¬ces. you are here standing a prisoner before us;examine your heart, and speak the truthfrom your conscience without prevarication ordisguise.May it please your excellency, replied Pedro¬sa, with all due submission to your hoiiness andthis reverend assembly, my most equitable judges,I conceive I stand here before you for no worsea crime than that of cudgelling a refractory mule,an animal so restive in its nature, (under correc¬tion of your holiness be it spoken,) that although9I were blessed with the forbearance of holy Job,(for like him too I am married, and my patiencehath been exercised by a wife,) yet could I notforbear to smite my beast for her obstinacy, andthe rather because I was summoned in the wayof my profession, as I have already made knownto your most merciful ears, upon a certain cry¬ing occasion, which would not admit of a moment’sdelay.Recollect yourself, Nicolas, said his Excellencythe Inquisidor-general; w’as there nothing else youdid, save smiting your bejst ?I take Saint Nicolas de Tolcntino to witness re¬plied he, that I know of no other crime, for which1 can be responsible at this lighteous tribunal,save smiting my unruly beast. Take notice,brethren, exclaimed the [nquisidor, this unholy'wretch holds trampling over friars to be nocrime.Pardon me, holy father, rep’ied Nicolas, I holdit for the worst of crimes, and tht refore willinglysurrender my refractory mule to be dealt with asyou see fit; and if you impale her alive, it willbe no more than she deserves.Your wits are too nimble, Nicolas, cried thejudge : have a care they do not run away withyour discretion; recollect the blasphemies youuttered in the hearing of those pious people.I humbly pray your Excellency, answered theprisoner, to recollect that anger is a short mad¬ness, and I hope allowances will be made byyour holy council for words spoke in haste to arebellious mule ; the prophet Balaam was thrownoff his guard by a simple ass, and what is an ass10compared to a mule? If your Excellency liadseen the lovely creature that was screaming inagony till I came to her relief, and how fine aboy L ushered into the world, which would havebeen lost but for my assistance, I am sure I shouldnot be condemned for a few hasty words spokenin passion.Sirrah ! cried one of the puisne judges respectthe decency of the court. Produce the contentsof the fellow’s pockets before the court, said thepresident; lay them on the table.Monster ! resumed the aforeside puisne judge,taking up the forceps, what is the use of thisdiabolical machine ? Please your reverence, re¬plied Pedrosa, aplum est ad extrahendos fattus'—Unnatural wretch, again exclaimed the judge,you have murdered the mothor.The mother of God forbid ! exclaimed Pedro¬sa. I believe I have a proof in my pocket thatwill acquit me of that charge, and so saying, hetendered the letter we have before made mentionof. 1 he secretary took it, and by command ofthe court read as follows n—“ Senior Don Manuel de Herrerra,“ When this lettei, which I send by NicolasPedrosa, shall reach your hands, you will knowthat t am safely delivered of a lovely boy, aftera dangerous labour, in consideration of which lpray you to pay to the said Nicolas Pedrosa thesum of twenty gold pistoles, which sum his Ex¬cellency ”Hoid, cried the Inquisitor-general, startinghastily from his seat, and snatching away the let¬ter, there is more in this than meets the eye:IJW'iflt'11break up the court; I must take an examinationof this prisoner in private.As soon as the room was cleared, the Inquisi¬tor-general, beckoning to the prisoner to followhim, and retired into a private closet, where, throw¬ing himself carelessly into an arm chair, he turn¬ed a gracious countenance upon the poor affright¬ed accoucheur, and bidding him sit down upona low stool by his side, thus addressed him :—Take heart. Senior Pedrosa, your imprisonmentis not likely to be very tedious, for 1 have a com¬mission you must execute without loss of time:you have too much consideration for yourself tobetray a trust, the violation of which must in¬volve you in inevitable ruin, and can in no degreeattaint my character, which is far enough beyondthe reach of malice; be attentive now, therefore,to my orders ; execute them punctually and keepmy secret as you tender your own life: dost thouknow the name and condition of the lady whomthou hast delivered? Nicolas assured him hedi,d not, and his Excellency proceeded as follows :Then I tell thee, Nicolas, it is the illustriousDonna Leonora de Casafonda ; her husband isthe president of Quito, and daily expected withthe next arrivals from the South Seas: now,though measures have been taken for detaininghim at the port, where he shall land, till he shallreceive further orders, yet you must be sensibleDonna Leonora’s situation is somewhat delicate ;it will be your business to take the speediestmeasures for her recovery : but as it seems shehas had a dangerous and painful labour, this maybe a work of more time than could well be wished,I12unless some medicines more efficacious than com¬mon are administered ; art thou acquainted withany such, friend Nicolas ?—So please your Ex¬cellency, quoth Nicolas, my posesses have beentolerably successful; I have bandages and cata-psalms, with oils and conserves that I have nocause to complain of; they will restore nature toits proper state in all decent time.— Thou talkestlike a fool, friend Nicolas, interrupting him, saidthe Inquisitor? What, idlest thou me of thyswathings and swaddlings ? quick work must bewrought by quick medecine : hast thou none suchin thy botica? Til answer for it thou hast not;therefore, look you sirrah, here is a little vialcompounded by a famous chemist; see that youmix it in the next apocem you administer toDonna Leonora; it is the most capital sedativein nature; give her the whole of it, and let herhusband return when he will, depend upon it hewill make no discoveries from her.— Humph!quoth Nicolas within himself, well said Inquisi-dor! He took the vial with all possible respect,and was not wanting in professions of the mostinviolable fidelity and secrecy.—No more wordsfriend Nicholas, quoth the Inquisidor, upon thatscore ; I do not believe thee one jot the more forall thy promises, my dependence is upon thyfears and not thy faith ; I fancy thou hast seenenough of this place not to be willing to returnto it once for all! Having so said he rang abell, and ordered Nicolas to be forthwith liber¬ated, bidding the messenger return his clothesinstantly to him with all that belonged to himand having slipt a purse into his hand well filled13with doubloons, he bade him begone about hisbusiness, and not see his face again till he hadexecuted his demands.Nicolas bolted out of the porch without takingleave of the altar, and never checked his speedtill he found himself fairly housed under shelterof his own beloved brass bason Aha ! quothNicolas, my lord inquisidor, I see the king is notlikely to gain one subject more by your intrigues {a pretty job you have set me about; and so,when I have put the poor lady to rest with yourdamned sedative, my tongue must be stopt nextto prevent its blabbing : but I’ll shew you I wasnot born in Andalusia for nothing. Nicolas nowopened a secret drawer, and took out of it a fewpieces of monoy, which, in fact, was his wholestock of cash in the world ; he loaded and primedhis pistols, and carefully lodged them in the hou-sers of his saddle ; he then buckled to his side histrusty spada, and hastened to caparison his mule.Ah, thou imp of the o!d one, quoth he, as heentered the stable, art thou not ashamed to lookme in the face ? Hut come, hussy, thou owestme a good turn, methinks ; stand by me this once,and be friend's for ever! thou art in good order,and if thou wilt put thy best foot foremost, like afaithful beast, thou shall not want for barley onthe way. The bargain w’as soon struck betweenNicolas and his mule, he mounted her in thehappy moment, and pointing his course towardthe bridge of Toledo, which proudly strides, withhalf a dozen lofty arches over a stream little morethan three feet wade, he found himself as com¬pletely in a desart in half a mile’s riding, as if he14.had been dropped in the centre of Arabia Petraea.As Nicolas’s journey was not a tour of curiosity,he did not amuse himself with a peep at Toledo,or Talavera, or even Merida by the way ; forthe same reason he took a circumbendibus roundthe frontier town of Badajoz; and crossing alittle brook, refreshed bis mule with the last gooddraught of Spanish water, and instantly congra¬tulated himself upon entering on the territory ofPortugal. Brava! quoth he, patting the neckof his mule, thou shalt have a supper this nightof the best sive meat that Estramamlura can fur¬nish : we are now in a country where the scat¬tered flock of Israel fold thick and fare well. Henow began to chaunt the Song of Solomon, andgently ambled on in the joy of his heart.When Nicolas at length reached the city ofLisbon, he bugged himself in his good fortune ;still he recollected that the Inquisition had longarms, and he was yet in a place of no perfectsecurity. Our adventurer had in early life actedas assistant-surgeon in a Spanish frigate bound toBuenos-Ayres, and been captured by a Britishman-of-war, and carried into Jamaica, had veryquietly passed some years in that place as jour¬neyman apothecary, in which time he had ac¬quired a tolerable acquaintance with the Englishlanguage. No sooner, then did he discover theBritish ensign flying on the poop of an Englishfrigate then lying in the Tagus, than he eagerlycaught the opportunity of paying a visit to thesurgeon ; and finding he was in want of a mate,offered himself, and was entered in that capacityfor a cruise against the French and Spaniards,16with whom Great Britain was then at war. Inthis secure asylum Nicolas enjoyed the first hap¬py moments he had experienced for a long timepast, and being a lively rood natured little fellow,and one that touched the guitar and sung sequi-dillas with a very good grace, he soon recom¬mended himself to his shup-mates, and grew infavour with every body on board, from the captainto the cook’s mate.When they were out upon their cruise, hover¬ing on the Spanish coast it occurred to Nicolas,that the Inquisitor-general at Madrid had toldhim of the expected arrival of the President ofQuito, and having imparted this to one of tholieutenants, he reported it to the captain; andas the intelligence seemed of importance, heavailed himself of it, by bawling into the trackof the homeward-bound galleons, and great wasthe joy, when at the break of the morning theman at the mast-head announced a square-riggedvessel in view. The ardour of a chase now setall hands at work; and a few hours brought themnear enough to discern that she was a Spanishfrigate, and seemingly from a long voyage ; littlePedrosa as alert as the rest, stript himself for hiswork, and repaired to his post in the cockpit,whilst the thunder of the guns reeled incessantlyover his head ; three loud cheers from the wholecrew' at length announced the moment of victory,and a few more minutes ascertained the goodnews that the prize was a frigate richly ladenfrom the South Seas with the Governor of Quitoand his suite on board.Pedrosa was now called upon deck, and sent16on board the prize as interpreter to the first lieu¬tenant, who was to take possession of her—Hefound every thing in confusion, a deck coveredwith the slain, and the whole crew in consterna¬tion at an event they were in no degree preparedfor, not having received any intimation of a war.He fonnd the officers in generil, and the passen¬gers without exception, under the most horridimpressions of the English, expecting to be but¬chered without any mercy. Don Manuel de Casa-fonda, the governor, whose countenance bespokea constitution far gone in a decline, had thrownhimself on a sola, in the last state of despair, andgiven way to an effusion of tears: when the lieu¬tenant entered the cabin he arose trembbng fromhis couch, and «ith the most supplicating actionpresented to him his sword, and with it a casketwhich he carried in his other hand : as he ten¬dered these spoils to his conqueror, whetherthrough his weakness or of his o^n will, he madea motion of bending his knee : the generousBriton, shocked at the unmanly overture, caughthim suddenly with both hands, and turning roundto Pedrosa, said aloud,—Convince this gentlemanthat he has fallen into the hands of an honourableenemy.—Is it possible ! cried Don Manuel, andlifting up his streaming eyes to the counte¬nance of the British officer, saw humanity, valour,and generous pity so strongly characterized in hisyouthful features, that the conviction was irre-sistable. Will he not accept ny sword? criedthe Spaniard. He deiires you to wear it, till hehas the honour of presenting you to his captain,Ah ! then he has a captain, exclaimed, Don Ma-nuel, his superior will be of another way ofthinking; tell him this casket contains my jew-( els; they are valuable; let him present them asa lawful prize, which will enrich the captor; hissuperior will not hesitate to take them from me.—If they are your excellency’s private property,replied Pediosa, I am ordered to assure you, thatif your ship were loaded with jewels, no Britishofficer in the service of his king will take them| at your hands ; the ship and effects of his Catho-ji lie Majesty are the only prize of the captors ; thej personuls of the passengers are inviolate.—Gen¬erous nation ! exclaimed Don Mannel, howgreatly have 1 wronged thee !—The boats of theBritish frigate now came alongside, and part ofthe crew were shifted out of the prize, taking theirclothes and Hunks along with them, in which theywere very coidialiy assisted by their brave con¬querors. The barge in a short time after cameaboard with an officer in the stern sheets, and thecrew in their white shirts and velvet caps, to escortthe governor and the ship’s captain on board thefrigate, which lay with her sails to the mast, await¬ing their arrival : the accommodation-ladder wasslung over the side, and manned for the prison¬ers, who were received on the gang-way by thesecond lieutenant, whilst perfect silence and thestrictest discipline reigned in the ship, where allwere under the decks, and no inquisitive curiouseyes were suffered to wound the feelings of theconquered even with a glance. In the door ofhis cabin stood the captain, who received themwith that modest complaisance, which does notrevolt the unfortunate by an overstrained polite-18ness: he was a man of high birth and elegantmenners, with a heart as benevolent as it wasbrave : such an address, set oft' with a personfinely formed and perfectly engaging, could notfail to impress the prisoners with the most fav¬ourable ideas; and as Don Manuel spoke Frenchfluently, lie could converse with the British Cap¬tain without the help of an interpreter: as lieexpressed an impatient desire of being admittedto his parole, that he might revisit his friendsand connections, from whom he had been longseparated, he was overjoyed to hear that theEnglish ship would carry her prize into Lisbon ;and that he would there be set or. shore, and per¬mitted to make the best of his way from thenceto Madrid, lie talked of his wife with all theardour of the most impassioned lover, and apo¬logized for his tears, by imputing them to theagony of his mind and infirmity of his health,under the dread of being longer separated troman object so dear to his heart, and on whom hedoated with the fondest affection. The generouscaptain indulged him in these Conversations, andbeing a husband himself, knew how to allow forall the tendernesses of his sensations. Ah, braveSir, cried Don Manuel, would to heaven it werein my power to have the honour of presentinginy beloved Leonora to you on your landing atLisbon.—Perhaps, added lie, turning to Pedrosa,who at that moment en ered the cabin, this gen¬tleman, w hom I take to be a Spaniard, may haveheard the name of Donna Leonora de Casafonda;if he has been at Madrid, it is possible he mayhave seen her; should that be the case he can'•zj19testify to her external charms ; I alone can wit¬ness to the exquisite perfections of her mind.—Senior Don Manuel, replied Pedrosa, I have .seenDonna Leonora, and your Excellency is warrant¬ed iu all you can say in her praise; she is of in¬comparable beauty These w ords threw the ux¬orious Spaniard into raptures; Ids eyes sparkledwith delight; the blood rushed into his emaciatedcheeks, and every feature glowed with unutter¬able' joy : he pressed Pedrosa with a variety ofrapid enquiries, all of which he evaded by plea dugignorance, Saying that he had only a casual glanceof her as she passed along the Prado. The em¬barrassment, however, winch accompanied theseanswers did not escape the Eng tsh captain, who,shortly after, drawing Pedrosa aside into the sur¬geon’s cabin, was by him made acquainted withthe melancholy situation of that unfortunate lady,and every particular of the storv as before related ;nay% the very vial was produced with its vile con¬tents, as put into the hands of Pedrosa by theInquisitor.Can there be such villainy'in man ? cried theBritish captain, when Pedrosa lied concluded hisdetail: alas! my heart bleeds for this unhappyhusband; assuredly that monster has destroyedLeonora; as for thee, Pedrosa, whilst the Brit¬ish flag flics over your head, neither Spain, norPortugal, nor Inquisitors, nor devils, shall annoythee under its protection ; but if thou ever ven-turest over the side of this ship, and rashly set-test thy foot upon Catholic soil, when we arriveat Lisbon, thou art a lost man. I were worsethan a madman, replied Nicolas', should 1 at-20tempt it Keep close in tin's asylum, then, re¬sumed the captain, and fear nothing ; had it beenour fate to have been captured by the Spaniard,what would have become of thee.— In the worseof extremities, replied Nicolas, I should haveapplied to the Inquisitor’s vial ; but I confess Ihad no fears of that sort; a ship so commandedand so manned, is in little danger of being car¬ried into a Spanish port,—I hope not, said thecaptain, and I promise thee, thou shall take thychance in her as long as site is afloat under mycommand ; and if vve live to conduct her to Eng¬land, thou shall have thy proper share of prize-money, which, if the galleon breaks up accordingto her entries, will be something towards enablingthee to shift, and if thou art as diligent in thycalling, as I am persuaded thou wilt be,—whilstI live thou shall never want a seaman’s friend.—At these cheering words, little Nicolas threwhimself at the feet of his generous preserver, andwith streaming eyes, poured out his thanks froma heart which was animated with joy and grati¬tude. 1 he captain raised him by the hand, andforbade him, as he prized his friendship, ever toaddress him in that posture any more ; thank me,if you will, added he, but thank me as ,one manshould another: let no knee bend, in this ship,but in adoration to God.—But now, continuedhe, let us turn our thoughts to the situation ofour unhappy Casafonda: we are now drawingnear Lisbon, where lie will look to be liberatedon his parole. By no means let him venture in¬to Spain, said Pedrosa ; I am well assured thereare orders to arrest him in e\ery port, or frontier/-?ntown where he may present himself. I can wellbelieve it, replied the captain ; his piteous casewill require further deliberation; in the meantime, let nothing transpire on your part; and keepyourself out of his sight as carefully as you can.—This said, the captain left the cabin, and bothparties repaired to their several occupations.As soon as the frigate and her prize cast anchorin the Tagus, Don Manuel de Cassafonda impa*tiently reminded our captain of his promisedparole. The painful moment was now come,when an explanation of some sort became una¬voidable : the generous Englishman, with acountenance expressive of the tenderest pit)', tookthe Spaniard’s hand in ids, and seating him on acouch beside him, ordered the eentinel to keepthe cabin private, and delivered himself to the fol¬lowing effect:—Senior Don Manuel, I must now impart to youan anxiety which 1 labour under on your account;1 have strong reasons to suspect you have enemiesin your own country, who are upon the watch toarrest you on your landing ; when 1 have toldyou this, I expect you will repose such trust inmy honour, and the sincerity of my regard foryou, as not to demand any further explanation ofthe particulars on which my intelligence is found¬ed.—Heaven and earth ! exclaimed the astonish¬ed Spaniard, who can be those enemies 1 haveto fear, and what can I have done to deservethem ! So far will 1 explain myself to you, an¬swered the captain, as to point out the principalenemy to you, the Inquisitor-general. The bestfriend I have in Spain, exclaimed the Governor,ray sworn protector, the patron of my fortune;he my enemy! impossible. Well, Sir, repliedthe captain, if my advice do not meet belief, Imast so far exert my authority for your sake, asto make this ship your prison, till I have waited onour Minister at Lisbon, and make the enquiriesnecessary for yoitr safety ; suspend your judgmentupon the seeming harshness of this measure tillI return to you again': and, at the same time,rising from his seat, he g'avp orders for the barge ;after leaving strict injunctidns with the first lieu¬tenant not to allow of the governor’s quitting thefrigate, he put off for the shore.The emissaries of the Inquisition having at lasttraced Pedrosa, our captain had no sooner turn¬ed into the porch of the hotel of Buenos-A\res,than he was accosted by a messenger of state,with a requisition for the surrender of Pedrosa.As soon as this requisition was explained to ourworthy captain, he dispatched the midshipman, tomake the best of his way back to the frigate, andto deliver a letter to the lieutenant ; then turningto the messenger, lie said, That Spaniard is nowborne on my books, and before you shall takehim out of the service of my king, you must sinkhis ship. He instantly proceeded to the house ofthe British Minister: here he found Pedrosa’s in¬telligence, with regard to the Governor, expresslyverified.The generous captain lost no time in returningto his frigate, where he immediately imparted toDon Manuel the intelligence he had obtained atthe British Minister's. The proposal was nowsuggested of sending letters into Spain, and the23governor retired to liis desk for the purpose ofwriting them. In the afternoon of the same day,the Minister paid a visit to the captain, and re¬ceived a packet from the hands of Don Manuel,promised to get forwarded by a safe conveyanceaccording to the direction.In due course of time, this fatal letter fromLeonora opened all the horrible transactions to thewretched husband :“ The guilty hand of an expiring wife, underthe agonizing operation of a mortal poison, tracesthese few trembling lines to an injured, wretchedhusband. If thou hast any pity for my partingspirit, fly the ruin that awaits thee, and avoid thisscene of villainy and horror. 1 have borne achild to the monster, whose poison runs in myveins. The li.quisitor is my murderer.— My penfallls from my hand.—Farewell for ever.”Had a shot passed through the heart of DonManuel, it could not more effectually have stoptits motions than the perusal of this fatal writing:he dropped lifeless on the couch, and but for thecare and assistance of the captain and Pedrosa,in that posture he had probably expired. Grieflike his cannot be described by words, for to wordsit gave no utterance ; ’twas suffocating, silentwoe.Let us drop the curtain over this melancholypause in our narration, and attend upon themournful widower, now landed upon Englishground, and conveyed by his humane and gener¬ous preserver to the house of a noble Earl, thefather of our amiable captain. At the period ofa few tranquihzing weeks, here passed in the24bosom of humanity, letters came to hand from theBritish Ministers at Lisbon, in answer to a memo¬rial, that I should have stated to have been drawnup by the friendly captain before his departurefrom that port. By these letters it appeared, thatthe criminal was either no longer in existence, orin a situation never to be heard of any more, tillroused by the awakening trump, he should besummoned to his tremendous last account. Asfor the unhappy widower, it was fully signified tohim, from authority, that his return to Spain,whether upon exchange or parole, would be nolonger opposed ; nor had he any thing to appre¬hend on the part of government, when he shouldarrive there. The same was signified in fewerwords to the exculpated Pedrosa.Whether Don Manuel de Casafonda will, at afuture period, avail himself of the overtures, timealone can prove: as for little Nicholas, whoseprize-money has set him up in a comfortable littleshop in Duke’s place, where he breathes theveins and cleanses the bowels of his Israelitishbrethren, in a land of freedom and toleration. Hismerry heart is at rest, save only when, with firein his eyes, and vengeance on his tongue, heanathematizes the Inquisition : and struts in thesynagogue every Sabbath, with as bold a stepand as erect a look, as if he was himself HighPriest of the Temple, going to perform sacrificesupon the re-assembling of the scattered ttibes.FINIS.

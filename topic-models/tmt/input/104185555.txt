Hlitchison, Bookseller,\9.Saltmarket.THI*GUDEMAN OF B ALL A NGEICH.A ROYAL TALE.Part I.In days of auld, when we had kingsAnd Nobles bauld, and other things,As camps', and courts, and kirks, and que&rs,And birkies bauld, for our forebears;"When Flodden field was won and lost.To sriony a hardy Scotsman’s cost.Our king was slain, in field of battle,'When sword, and targe, and spear did rattle:They fought it fairly, tho’ they fell,And few came hame the tale to telLThere great nobility did fall,And most of commoners and jdi#:E’re James did gang to field of battle,He number’d a’his stock and cattle;His houshold gear he left his wife,In case that he might lose his life:•This battle, fought 9th September, 151:3,was begun at 4 o’clock afternoon, and lastedthree hours.4She, in his absence, to governUntil the up-growth of his bairn,A son, baith beautiful and fair.And jdm'he nam’d his royal heir./Tvras thus he left his royal plan,If Marg’ret coul’d but want a man,But this is more then Marg’ret ran.A year had scarce o’erturn’d its wheels.When Marg’rct gat amang the chiels.And marry’d Douglas, son of Angus,As brave a lad as was amang us:And ihen her government did cease,And she and husband liv’d in peace.James had an uncle, then in France,Whar mankind laugh, and thrive by chance*Him they sent for, whose name was John,And surnam’d duke of Albiou:He came, to see his nephew right,Whose father bravely dy’d in fight;And when he came, some loo’d his rule,While others did it ridicule.The Humes and Douglas were divided.And sometimes by the sword decided;Their hot contest did kindle faction,And threw the kintra distraction.The king grew up, and wish’d to kenHis guilefu’ foes, fras honest men,And when he took it in his palate,He’d tak a good pike staff and wallet,And gang thro' a’ the kintra round,To see where honesty was found:Frae men of hill, and met of dale,He’d ca’mly hear the simple tale;!And thus he kenn’d wha best to trflK*And wha maist held him in disgust.Ae day, he Falkland left in dudgeon,And arn.’d himsel’ we* belt and bludgeon.And toward Stirling held his way,As lang as he had light o’ day:Thio’ Aughtermughty came wi’ speed,Nor met wi’ ought that he might dread;But when he saw the sun decline.And on the Ochiels faintly shine;He look’d him round what was the bestAnd nearest place for him to rest:At length he pitch’d upon a house,And in he hie’d him, frank and croueesGude e’en quo’ he, to a’ within,While cantily the wife did spin,And daughters three sit by the fire,To do whatever she’d oesire.Cou’d ye gi’e quarters to a stranger,Wha very seldom is a ranger?For, as 1 am ten miles frac hame,And find my feet are wearing lame,I wish to stay within this eight,Until the morn shall show its light.T’ e wife reply d, There sit ye down;1 hope ye are nae gipsey lown,That’s come our weakness for to view,And rob us while we’re kind to you-Bess, cry your father Crae the stable,And he will guess, for he is able,As he can read a stranger’s lace,And ken if he be scant o’ grace.In came the cotter, braw and decent,And thought the stranger look’d sae pleasant,36He setg^im in the iniekte «^rair.And hade him rest and take nae fear.Where >riii ye ni’bour when at hame,I’m wrae to see y<iur feet sae lame;Do ye abide in Borrow town.Or count your-self a kintra loun.Sir, by your leave reply’s*! the king,1 do the bv >t 1 can, to bringMy only living frae a farm,Nor wish my king nor kintra harm.1 had some business east in Fife,Now I’m gawn iiatne to sea my wife.Wei! said, my friend, ye’re welcome here,Gudewife, come make seine dainty cheer,Some hah and sauce put on to boil,Bring down the hen that’s ncist the cook,For she’s the flow’r o’ a’ live duck :And warm yon haggise in a pan,And then we’ll fen’ as weel’s wee jn.But stranger, say, what news is gawn ■?How sells your beasts? how sets your land?is peace or war the kinlra talk?For fo'k ken hardly how to walk.Yes, said the king, that’s very true.But rogues will soon be made to rue;For gude king James has made a law.That rich anil poor, and braid and draw.Will not be spar’d, if guilty foundTo take a lile, or yet to wound.Or pilfer cattle, gear or corn;This law will put them to the born,7Fifteen lang-hcaded wart’s wonders*,He has appointed for such blunders.Now gipsey bands will soon be bush'd.And a’ their cruelty be crush’d.The king has got some men in pay,To scour the kintra ev’ry way,And bring thetn in, without annoy;—Last week they haiig’d up GilderoyJ:,The farmer said, your tale is goodAnd puts me in a hearty mood :Bribg ben, guidewife, a cogue o’ alt,To tost the king, I winna fail-;And if he wants ought I can gi’e.Of sons | ha’e but only three,And he may Ha’e them in his band;For they are gude as in the land,To scour the highest hill or dale.And hard’s the job wou’d make them fait:For mony a day the king’s been spoil’d,And by these bauds been hardy toil’d:* The Lord’s -of Session—that venerablebody were put into their present form by kingJames the 5th.f In these times Scotland was pestered bygrato bands of fortune-tellers, how stole abdrobbed in the most daring manner; Theyreckoned their descent from Egypt; but were,as an English author calls them, the runaga¬tes and the rascallity of many nations.f Gilderoy, a famous Scotch robber, who,in the days of king James the 5th was hungon a gallows fifty feet high, between Letchand Edinburgh. /8Altho’ 1 never saw his face,Yet I should iiko to see his Grace,What! said the king, ne’er saw his face !And yet to Jive sae near his place?Gin ye wad tak a step, and .seeAuld Stirling town, and vat on me,Ye’seget the best that I can spare,O’ halesome food, and kintra fare;On Castlehili I pay my rentCa’d Ballar.geich, my name is ken’t.And there’s my hand, when ye come there.That ye shall get the meikie chair.And stay and pass ae night wi’ me,And then the king ye’ll likely see:For in a month will be a court,Whereat will be some manly sport,And he’ll be there, if he be spar’d.And mony a decent lord and laird.I’ll wait upon you, said the man,And sort mysel’ as wed's I can.Come, to his health wi’ a’ my heart,And place to them that take his part.They took their supper, slept the night,The king he rose by peep o’ light;And wauk’d to Stirling hale and feir;So for a while we’ll leave him here.9TUXGUDEMAN OF BALLANGEICH.A ROYAL TALEPart II.THEstranger gone, John aft did tank,About his promis’d kintra wauk.On day appointed, John himseP,AYas made as braw as tongue can teli;His coat was made of hodden gray,Hfs bannet blue, and braid that day;His plaiding hose were snod and clean,And person gude, as might be seen;He arm’d himsel’ we staff and dagger,Nor fear’d he ony randy beggar;To Stirling came, in decent haste,And speir’d where Ballangeich was plac’d;A spy was set, that did him bringTo Douglas’ room*, where sat the king.Ye re welcome, John; {here, tak a seat;Bring something ben, that he may eat.How s a the weans, and the gudewife ?I hope they’re weel, and a’ in life?A side

spciring,I left them hale and weel, and steering.How fends your ain, now 1 maun spelt?—Dear man, but ye live snugly here;But surely, Ipd ye’ll get a fright.Whene’er there comes a windy night.Were our clay biggi.tgs on this rock,They cou’dna stand a second shock;But yours is static and lime, I see,And stands the storm fu’ hardily.Yes, said the king, we’re no to wean;We live baith warm, and snug, and bie^Our^nastei’s willing, as lie’s able.And sometimes bids us to his table;This very day I’m bid to sitWi’ him, and take a share of it,And if I can a stranger biing,Joo’es his kinlra and his king,He’s just as welcome there as me.Or any in the company;^ow ye’re the man I mean to ha’e,Since fate, that’s gade, has made it sao;Then be not blatc, there's nae occastofl,Tho’ he’s the man that rules the nation.Na, na, quo’ John, I darna venture,Amang such company to enter,I, that did never eat a meal,But simple fair or kintra kail;And never saw a company.Of fo’k as braw as they man be.Ne’r think on that, reply’d the king.For here the way 1’il cyke the thing:Pll send word in I bring wi’ »eA friend came from the East kintry;HI be nac brawcr then ye see me,And ye’il eat aff the side-board wi’ me;And what I do, observe the Same,Then ye’ll be right, and free o’ blame.Weel then, quo’ John, if I maun gang,Right fear’d I am that I do wrang;I’m very sure, when in the place,I will not see ae single face;And for the king, 1 will fa’ down.To look on him that wears a crown.Then, said the king, when we ga’e in.Just hing your bonnet on a pin;Wauk after me, and tak your scat,What’s set before you, frankly eat;As for the company, ne’er mind them,But just tak them as ye find them.The king ye winna ken at a’,As lang as dinner’s in the ha’jBut when the healths do circle round.Then where he sits is easy found:Yet dinna start when that ye see,But drink his health upon your knee.A’ this I will observe in full,Or it shall be against my will;But, HI assure ye, I am frighted,In case my courage be benighted.They baith gaed- in, and down they sat,And, hand to nieve, began to chat.The nobles came, and t»ok their place,But did not mind a stranger’s face.12The dinner serv’d, in roval order,While ev’ry guest kept by his border;And John he made as ca’m a mealAs he had been at kintra kail;But aft he look’d, beneath his brow*To spy if he the king cou’d view;Sometimes he pich’d a noble .squireThat sat upon an easy chair;Another time he thought a knight% That, jolly like, sat on his rightCou’d set a purple bonnet weel,Or yet, might wear a coat o’ steelrHe little thought his Simple friendShou’d wear the head whar a was pinn’d*The dinner o’er the table drawn*They then the healths began to pawn.When ev’ry one, one bended knee,Did tost king James wc hearty glee ;Thefj John look’d at his friend, wi’ dread,in case that he might loss his head.He thought on a’ the deeds he’d done,And fand himsel’ sair out o’ tune:His face grew pale, his tongue did faulter.And a’ his countenance did alter.The king beheld the consternation,And saw poor John in odd vexation.What fear ye, John, I’m the gudemanOf Bailangeich and there's my han’;And were the kintia only fill’dWith such as you, twa’d ne’er be spili’d,And, by my word, that thee assures,I name you here, the king of Muirs;Von maiiins three around your house,Mfaf gar you cock fu’ bien and crouse:ISIgrant them to you, and your heiri*,As lang as kirks are bless’d wi’ lair,;Or courtiers are thought to flatter,And thus I end the simple matter.My nobles leal, now as you stand.How nappy were our native land,It’ev'ry man wou’d work his farm,VYi' i.ardy toil, devoid of harm;And raise a decent healthfu’ breed.To l iud his plough, and sow his seed*And, when we mean to face the foe,I hey'd help our hand to wave the blow rAll this I’ve done, because I foundHis judgment, honest, gude and sound.And offer’d kindly, frae the heartHis ain three sons to hand my part.Mow while the slae grows on the thorn,Or Scotland feeds on pith of corn;Let honesty meet its reward,And still be held in due regard.* The above tale is so much a fact, as that'some forty years ago these heirs were in theabove-mentioned possession; but, by

JPETER PICKUP AND TAMMIE TREDDLES.Peteb Picked, or as he micht wi’ mair proprietybe ca’d, Peter Pick-up, leev’t in a bit kintra clachan,on the borders o’ Dumbartonshire and Renfrewshire.He was a chap aboot the middle bicbt, an sbo’d ba’e beenlicht complexioned, bad it no been that, as a rule, beonly wasb’t bis face ainst a week. His hair, whichplay’d wi’ the wun, was a carrity red, an’ to the credito’ nature, bung in curls. He wore a cap wi’ a greatbig peak, and a moleskin coat wi’ four great bigpouches, twa inside and twa ootside; bis waiscoat wasmade o’ printed velveteen, and bis breeks o’ woollencord, gayen ticbt in the legs, so as tae keep the calvesin, for fear they shou’d tak a notion tae gang out taegrass ; they, alang wi’ his boots, regular skin driverswi’ fifty lace boles in them, a white calico sark, and aTurkey red napkin aboot bis neck, made up the toggeryo’ ane o’ the cutest chaps o’ the day.He bawkit a’ sorts o’ pats and pans for a leevin, anhe wasna verra particular aboot getting siller for bisgudes, if he could dooble or treple their value in auldclaes or even rags or banes, bits o’ brass, or auld aim,4physic bottles, or in fact onything that cam’ in hisway. He was gayen lucky tae in finin things aforethey were lost, that is to say, just when they were gaunto be lost, an, indeed, onything that he, in the warm¬ness o’ his heart, picket up in this way as he was gaunhis roun’s, he put safe by, so that them that lost itmicht get it again if they could fin’t,—aye, if theycould fin’t! hit I never yet heard tell o’ ony body thatwas sae fortunate, for Peter could get quat o’ hisspulzie vera quick to folk that was just as fond o’fin’in’ things afore they were lost as he was. Hecarried a lucky hag too, whilk contained a wheen writ¬ten tickets, three pairts o’ them blanks and the itherpairt o’them prizes. Peter could neither read nor write,so he had to get a frien’ to make the tickets for him.Weel, ye see, a’e day when he was gaun his roons,a wife brocht him a lot o’ rags an’ bargant for adraw in the lucky pock. Divin’ in her haun, she drewout a ticket an haun’d it to Peter to tell her what shehad drawn, for she coudna read. Peter took it fraeher, sayin, at the same time, “weel, what hae yegotten?” “0 I dinna ken,” quo’ the wife, “whatdae ye ca’t?” “O’ I ken fine what it is, its a eggcup,” and he rummaged for ane among the dishes inthe cart. “ A egg cup,” says the wife, “ I’ll no haethat. “ 0 vera weel,” says Peter, “ back yer chancewi’ a penny an try’t again ” ; and while the wife anhim were taukin, wee Tammie Tutup cam forret, andhe says ta Peter, “let me see the ticket,” and efter5a bit o’ shuffling he lets him see’t. Tammie lucksat it, an’, hurstin’ into a lauch, he says, “ that ticketsays partin’s taes.’’ “ Partin’s taes he hang’t! ” saysPeter, “ the fule canna read. I ken fine what it’s, its achappin’ bowl,” an’ he harm’d the wife ane, wha gaedawa miscawin’ Peter for everything that was bad—and telling him tae gang awa hame, an’ gang ta theschule an’ learn ta read. Well it was true enouch theticket said partin’s taes; the frien, ye see, that wrotethe tickets had dune’t ta get a rise out o’ Peter.Weel, there was a’e day Peter gaed into Glasgow tobuy a stock o’ guids, when he, unfortunately, fell onthe fuddle, and spent a’ his bawbees. Next day hetook a dauner thro’ the toon, an when gaun up theGallowgate he slippit into a public hoose, keepit bya chap that consider’t himsel to be aboot as sharp astwa folk, tae hae a licht ta his pipe; weel, he wauketup the lobby an intil the news-room, an he saw thatthere wasna a creature in’t but himsel, so when hehad lichtet his pipe, he tumt his back ta the fire, andluckin’ roon the room he saw a nice weather glasshingin’ up again the wa. His een glisten’t as he lucketat it, an his heart lifted up, as folks usually dae whenthey fin onything worth while. Takin the weatherglass doon, an pittin it under his oxter, he wauket awadoon the lobby quit composed, and just when he waspassing the bar window the landlord got his e’e on him,and cries out in a rage, “ I’m sure I telt you cursthawkers mony a time that I’ll no hae ye coming aboot6this hoose, an’ if yere no out verra quick, auld MuffinHead, i’ll kick ye out.” Peter nae way discomposed,turnt to him and says, “0, verra weel man, yeneedna be sae crusty, I’ll come nae mair, I assureye” ; and he gangs richt out wi’ the weather glassaneath his oxter, an gets clean awa wi’t. 1(7601, thenext mornin’ a neibor woman gangs into thepublic house, an’ she says to the landlord, “do yethink its gaun to be fair the day ? I cam in to tak aluck at yer weather glass, but I see ye hae shiftet it.“ Wh—ew,” he whislt, as he wauket awa to look forthe glass, for he had min’ o’ ordering Peter out wi’ane under his arm, an’ he was guyen vext when hefan it was awa.Peter use’t to ca’ at Paisley, ance’t a week, whilegaun his roons; noo, there leev’t in Paisley abit of a scientific chap, they cawed Tammie Treddles,or as he was mair commonly ca’d, Tammie-a’-things.He keepit a shop an’ selt a’ sorts o’ things,—thumbels,peries, bools, smothing aims, besoms, and mouse-traps.He was a, queer sort o’ body, Tammie. He made air-guns and magnetized razors^ and did heaps o’ ither ooto’ the way sort o’ things, that langsynewou’d hae gotten'im the name o’ haein dealins wi’ the de’il. He hadaye some o’ his wares ootside o’ the door, an often hehad things tain awa, by somebody or another, but hecould never catch the thief. Weel, ae day he thochthe wud try a new plan to catch the marauder. Hehad a very poorfu galvanic battery in the shop, an’7he fixt the wires throo a sma’ hole in the wa’, an’ con¬nected them to a brass pan, an’ placed it ootside o’the door, an’ keepet the battery working at full poor.In the coorse o’ the day, Peter happent to come doonthe street, an when he got foment Tammie’s shop hemade a full stop, an his een fairly glisten’t as he gota glint o’ the pan. Watching his opportunity, he slipsdoon the pavement, and just as he was passin’ thepan, he loots doon to pick it up, when, gude keep usa the day! the pan stuck to his han. Noo, Peter beingin a hurry to get awa, plays clutch wi the ither han,when, losh keep us ! that ane stuck fast tae. Here wasa pretty pickle ta be into. He wriggled and twistedaboot, like a leevin eel in a frying pan, an screwed hisface into a sort o’ shapes, bit he durstna cry oot for fearo’ being catcht. “ Cha, cha, cha,” he keepet gaun on,till at last it brocht him to his knees, an cha’in’ awawi’ horrible gim, he at last spoke out, no being ableta stan the twisting o’ his nerves ony langer. “Oh !Ah ! Oh! ” he roart oot. This brocht Tammie to thedoor, an as he lucket at Peter, he cried, “0 ho! Isee wha’s the thief noo ; what are ye makin’ sic a dinaboot ? Is’t owre warm for ye.” “ Lowse me, lowse me,for gudeness sake,” cries Peter, “ I was jist pitten apreen in a wee hole in the pan; oh, lowse me, lucksharp.” “ A preen! ” says Tammie, as he stood lauchinat Peter’s twists and capers, “ a preen! oh! then, youmun hae gotten a baud o’ the sharp end, and the nebhas run into your fingers, for yer makin’ din eneuch.”8Tammie stoppet the battery, bit no before be badsent for the police, wha took Peter to the office, anthe next day he was handed ower to o’or Men thegaoler, with instructions to be ta’en particular care o’for three months, till he got owre the shock that hereceived frae the electric pan.Tammie Treddles has been thinkin’ to try and geta patent for his new method o’ thief catchin’. Do yethink he could get ane ? The name he intends to ea’it, is “ the Electro-magno-misdemeno-catchum-alivo.”J. AND J. COOK.

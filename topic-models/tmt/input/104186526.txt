This although not a very brilliantoccupation, was the profefSnn-to which I was deftinedat that time of life when I was thought capable of eafn-iag my livelihood.

Scarcely fcould thefe wicked domeftica contain their mirth, whenthey heard my vain bride, who always fpoke to themwith haughty diftance, addrefling herfelf to me in termsthe moft refpeftful, enquiring the names of my chateaux,the extent of my eflatis and of my teignorial rights ofhunting and fifhieg ; dwelling with complacency on mymines, which to her lively apprehenfion were equal atlead to thofe of Peru. On fubjecla fuch as thefe turnedcur conveifation, when three leagues beyond Mouteii-mart we perceived the narrow lane which led to a vil¬lage, the fteepie of which appeared diflaat from the highroad. This poor village, alas! was mine. The criticalmoment was approaching !We pafled over lands that certaln'y were not mine,and after three hours long and difficult travelling, ourcoachman, too well inftrudled, ftopt the carriage at thedoor of a miferable hut.

My engravers,while they taught me my part had kept their own fecrfct.They carried off every thing with them like the fcenc-fhifters of a theatre, who lock up the decora.ions afterthe piece is finilhed. As for the unfortunate Aurora,(he faw nothing of this—-Her former lover continuedfpeaking when file no longer heard or felt. The ruffiansi| left her, when they departed in a deep fvroon.

fllllili O’ IlFTIE’S AjIHIE:ORANDREW LAMMIE,^Ulhc trumpeter of Jhjbic.OF SCOTLANDv ^O/Nj burABERDEEN : LEWIS SMITH & SON,i893-NOTEThe ill-starred loves of Tiftie’s bonnie Annie, and the Trumpeter of Fyvie, havealready been made familiar to the reader of Ballad Poetry by Mr. Jamieson, whohas published in his collection two different sets of this simple but not unpatheticditty.* Neither of these sets, however, is so complete as the present version,which is a reprint from a stall copy published at Glasgow several years ago,collated with a recited copy, which has furnished one or two verbal improvements.“The beauty, gallantry, and amiable qualities of ‘Bonnie Andrew Lammie,’seem,” says Mr. Jamieson, “to have been proverbial wherever he went, and thegood old cummer in Allan Ramsay, as the best evidence of the power of her ownyouthful charms, and the best apology for her having cast a leggen girth hcrsel,says:—‘ I se warrant ye have a’ heard tellOf bonnie Andrew Lammie?Stiffly in love wi’ me he fell,As soon as e’er he saw me—That was a day ! ’“ In this instance, as in most others in the same piece, it seems most probablethat Allan Ramsay forgot that he was writing of the days of the original authorof ‘Christis Kirk on the Green,’ and copied only the manners and traditions ofhis own times. If a woman, who could boast of having had an intrigue with theTrumpeter of Fyvie, was hale and hearty at the time when Allan wrote, we mayreasonably suppose poor Tiftie s Annie to have died sometime about the year1670.” This conjecture as to the period when“ The fairest Flower was cut down by love,That e’er sprung up in Fyvie,”is very near the truth, if the notice contained in the title of the stall copy referredto can be admitted as evidence on the point. It is this :—“Andrew Lammie : orMill o’ Tiftie’s Annie. This Tragedy was acted in the year 1674.”It has been remarked by Mr. Jamieson that “this ballad is almost entirelywithout rhymes, as cadence in the measure is all that seems aimed at; and thefew instances of rhyme that occur appear to be rather casual than intentional.”Though the present set is not so faulty in this respect as in the copies which cameunder Mr. Jamieson’s observation, it, as well as the others, has another peculiar¬ity deserving attention, namely, the studied recurrence of rhyme in the middle ofthe first and third lines of a great many of the stanzas.It may be stated that the present set of the ballad agrees with any recitedcopy which the Editor has hitherto met with in the West Country.Wide Popular Ballads and Songs.

”“ Thou may’st come to the Bridge of Sleugh,And there I’ll come and meet thee.”“ My love I go to Edinbro’,And for a while must leave thee.”She sighed sore, and said no more,“ But I wish that I were wi’ thee.”“I’ll buy to thee a bridal gown,My love, I’ll buy it bonnie;”“ But I’ll be dead ere you come backTo see your bonnie Annie.”“ If you’ll be true, and constant too,As my name’s Andrew Lammie,I shall thee wed when I come backTo see the lands of Fyvie.”“ I will be true and constant too.To thee my Andrew Lammie,But my bridal bed will ere then be madeIn the green churchyard of Fyvie.”“ Our time is gone and now comes on,My dear, that I must leave thee ;If longer here I should appear,Mill o’ Tiftie he would see me.”“ I now for ever bid adieuTo thee, my Andrew Lammie;Ere ye come back, I will be lainIn the green churchyard of Fyvie.”/He hied him to the head of the house,To the house top of Fyvie ;He blew his trumpet loud and shrill,’Twas heard at Mill o’ Tifty.Her father lock’d the door at night,Laid by the keys fu’ canny ;And when he heard the trumpet sound,Said, “Your cow is lowing Annie.”“ My father dear, I pray forbear,And reproach no more your Annie,For I’d rather hear that cow to low,Than ha’e a’ the kine in Fyvie.“ I would not for my braw new gown,And a’ your gifts so many,That it were told in Fyvie’s landHow cruel you are to Annie.“ But if you strike me I will cry,And gentlemen will hear me;Lord Fyvie will be riding by,And he’ll come in and see me.”At the same time the lord came in,He said, “What ails thee, Annie?”“ ’Tis all for love, now I must dieFor bonnie Andrew Lammie.”“ Pray, Mill o’ Tifty, gi’e consent,And let your daughter marry.”“ It will be with some higher matchThan the Trumpeter of Fyvie.”“ If she were come of as high a kindAs she’s adorned with beauty,I would take her unto myself,An4 make her mine own lady.”8“ It’s Fyvie’s lands are fair and widerAnd they are rich and bonnie;I would not leave my own true loveFor all the lands of Fyvie.”Her father struck her wondrous sore,As also did her mother ;Her sisters always did her scorn ;But woe be to her brother.Her brother struck her wondrous sore.With cruel strokes and many ;He brake her back in the hall door,For liking Andrew Lammie.“ Alas ! my father and mother dear,Why so cruel to your Annie ?My heart was broken first by love,My brother has broken my body.“ O mother dear, make ye my bed,And lay my face to Fyvie ;Thus will I lie, and thus will die,For my love, Andrew Lammie.“Ye neighbours hear, both far and near,Ye pity Tiftie’s Annie,Who dies for love of one poor lad,For bonnie Andrew Lammie.“ No kind of vice e’er stain’d my life,Nor hurt my virgin honour ;My youthful heart was won by love,But death will me exoner.”Her mother then she made her bed,And laid her face to Fyvie ;Her tender heart it soon did brake,And ne’er saw Andrew Lammie. ,9But the word soon went up and downThrough all the lands of Fyvie,That she was dead and buried,Even Tiftie’s bonnie Annie.Lord Fyvie he did wring his hands,Said “ Alas ! for Tiftie’s Annie ;The fairest Flower’s cut down by love,That e’er sprung up in Fyvie.“ O, woe betide Mill o’ Tiftie’s pride,He might have let them marry ;I should have giv’n them both to liveInto the lands of Fyvie.”Her father sorely now lamentsThe loss of his dear Annie ;And wishes he had giv’n consentTo wed with Andrew Lammie.Her mother grieves both air and late,Her sister’s cause they scorn’d her;Surely her brother doth mourn and grieveFor the cruel usage he’d giv’n her.But now, alas ! it was too late,For they could not recall her ;Through life, unhappy is their fate,Because they did controul her.When Andrew hame from Edinburgh cameWith meikle grief and sorrow ;“ My love has died for me to-day,I’ll die for her to-morrow.“ Now, I will on to Tiftie’s den,Where the burn runs clear and bonnie ;With tears I’ll view the Bridge of Sleugh,Where I parted last with Annie.IO“ Then will I speed to the churchyard,To the green churchyard of Fyvie ;With tears I’ll water my love’s grave,Till I follow Tiftie’s Annie.”Ye parents grave, who children have,In crushing them be canny ;Least when too late you do repent—Remember Tiftie’s Annie.

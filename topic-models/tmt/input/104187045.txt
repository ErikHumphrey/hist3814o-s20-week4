I.How King Henry VIII. used to visitthe Wa ches in the City, and howhe became acquainted with a mer¬ry jovial Cobler.It was the custom of King Henrythe eighth, to walk late in the nighthot > rhe City disguised, to observeand ta> e notice how the constablesand watch performed their duty, notonly in guarding the city gates, butalso in diligently watching the in¬ward parts of the city, that so they8might, in a great measure preventthose disturbances and casualitieSwhich too often happen in great andpopulous cities in the night, and thishe did often times, without the leastdiscovery who he was ; returninghome to Whitehall early in the mor¬ning.Now in his return home throughthe Strand, he took notice of a certaincobler, who was constantly' up atwork, whistling and singing everymorning. The King was resolved tosee him and be acquainted with him,in order to which he immediatelyknocks the heel off his shoe by hitingit against a stone ; and having sodone, he bounced at the cobler’s stall.: ft ; «'• - t A. *| ' 'Who’s their ? cries the cobler.Here’s one, cries the King. Withthat the cobler opeued the st;all cioor,and the. King as, ed him if he couldset the heel on his shoe.4Yes, that I can, says the cobler*Come in, honest fellow, and sit theedown by me, and I will do it forthee straight; the cobler scraping hisawls and old shoes to one side, tomake room for the King to sit down.The King being hardly able to for¬bear laughing at the kindness of theCobler, asked him if there was not ahouse hard by that sold a cup of ale,and the people up.Yes, said the cobler, there is an innever the way, where I belive thefolks are up. for the carriers go fromthence very early in the morning.With that the King borrowed anold shoe from the cobler, and wentover to the inn, desiring the Coblerwould bring his shoe to him thitheras soon as he had put on the heel a-gain. The cobler prondsed he would.So making what haste he could toput on the heel, he carries it over tothe King, saying, Iionest blade, here5is thy shoe, and I warrant thee it willnot come off again in haste.Very well, says the King, whatmust you have for your pains ?A couple of pence, replied the cob-ler.Well, said the king seeing thou artan honest merry fellow, here is a toas¬ter for thee—come sit down by me, Iwill drink a full pot with thee. Comehere’s a good health to the King.With all my heart, said the cobler,I’ll pledge thee were it in water.So the cobler sat down by the King,and was very merry, and drank offhis liquor very freely ; he likewisesung some of his merry songs andcatches, whereat the king laughedhearily, and was very jocund andpleasant with the cobler, telling himwithal that his name was Harry Tu¬dor, that he belonged to the court, 5c6that if he would come and see himthere, he would make him very wel¬come, because he was a merry com¬panion, and charged him not to for¬get his name and to ask any one for, im about the court, and they would;oon bring him to him ; for, said theking, I am very well known there.'• ow the cobler little dreamt that-> as the King that spa ice to him,'ess that the King’s name wasK ny Tudor Therefore, with agreat deal of confidence he stands up,pats off his hat, makes two or threescrapes with his foot, and gives theKing many thanks, also telling him,that he wTas one of the most honestfellows that ever he met with in allhis life-time and although he hadnever been at court, yet he should notbe long oefore he would make a ho¬liday to come and see him.Whereupon the King paying forwhattney had drunk, would have ta¬ken his leave of theGobler ; but he*7not being willing to part with him,took hold of his hand and said, Bymy faith you must not go, you shallnot go, you shall first go and see mypoor habitation, I have there a tub ofgood brown ale that was never tap¬ped yet, you must go and taste it, foryou are the most honest blade I evermet withal, and I love an honest mer¬ry companion with all my heartCHAP. II.How the Cobier entertained the kingin his cellar, and of the disturbancethey had like to have had by hiswife Joan.So the Cobler took the King withhim over the way where he had hiscellar adjoining the stall, which washandsomely and neatly furnished fora man of his profession. Into hiscellar he had the king. There said he,sit down you’re welcome, but I mustdesire you to speak softly for fear ofwaking my wife Joan who lives hard8by (shewing the King a close bedmade up at a corner of the cellar,much like a closet) for if she shouldawake, she will make our ears ringagain.At which speech of the cobler’s, theking laughed, and told him he wouldbe mindful and follow his directions.Whereupon the cobler kindled upa fire, and fetched out a brown loaf,from which he cut a lusty toast,which he toasted at the fire j then hebrought out his Cheshire cheese—-Now. says he, there is as much fel¬lowship in eating as in drinking ;which made the king admire thehonest freedom of the cobler.So having eaten a bit, the coblerbegan a health, “ To all true heartsand merry companions.” At whichthe King smiled, raying, Friend, I’llpledge thee. *In this manner they eat and drank9together till it was almost break ofday ; the cobler being very free ofhis liquor, and delighting the Kingwith several of his old stories, inso¬much, that he was highly pleasedwith the manner of his entertainmentwhen on a sudden, the cobler’s wifebej;an to wake, I faith, says the cob¬ler, you must begone, my wife beginsto grumble, she’ll awake presenty,and I would not for half the shoes inmy shop she would find you here.Then taking the king by the hand,he led him up atairs, saying, Fare-wel, honest friend, it shan’t be longbefore I make a holiday to come andsee thee at court.Thou shait be kindly welcome, re¬plied the King.So they parted, the King on his wayto Whitehall, and the cobler to hiscellar, and there putting all things torights before his wife Joan got up,he went to work again, whistling it10& singing as merry as he used to d©being much satisfied that he happen¬ed on so good and jovial a compani¬on, still pleasing himself in histhoughts how merry he should bewhen lie came to court.CHAP. HI.How the Coblcr prepared himself togo to court, and how he was setout in the best manner by his wifeJoan.Now as soon as the King camehome, he sent out orders about thecourt, that if any one enquired forhim by the name of Harry Tudor,they should immediately bring himbefore him, whatever he was, with¬out any further examination of him.The cobler thought every day amonth till he had been at court to seehis new acquaintance, and was trou¬bled how he should g t leave of hiswite Joan, for he could not get with*11out her knowledge, by reason he didresolye to make himself as tine as hecould, for his wife always kept thekeys of his holiday cloaths, whereu¬pon one evening as they sat at sup«per,'finding her in very good hum¬our, he began to lay open his mindto her, telling her the whole story oftheir acquaintance, repeating it overand over airain, that he was the mosthonest felloe that ever he met with.Husband, quoth she, because youhave been so ingenious to tell me thewhole truth, I will give you leave tomake a holiday for this once -youshall go to court, and I will mase youas fine as 1 can.So it was agreed that he should gothe court the next day ; whereuponJoan rose betimes the next morning,to brush up her husband’s holidaycl >thes, and made him as fine as sheCould. She washed and ironed thelace-band and made his shoes shinetha he might see his face in them ;having done this, she made her hus-12hand rise and pull off his shirt. Thenshe washed him with warm waterfrom head to foot, putting on him aclean shirt; afterwards she dressedhim in his holiday clothesj pinninghis laced band in prim.CHAP. IV,The Cobler’s Reception at Court,with the Manner of bis Behaviorbefore the King.THE coblef being thus set forth,strutted through the streets like acrow in a gutter, thinking himself asline as the best of them all.In this manner he came to court,walking up and down, and staring onevery body he met with, not know¬ing to whom to ask for Harry TudorAt last he espied one, as he thoughtin the habit of a servaat, to w homhe made this addresss saying.Dost thou hear, honest fellow, d#13you know one Harry Tudor whobelongs to the Court.Yes, said the man, follow me, andI will bring you to him.With that he had him presently upinto the guard-chamber, telling oneof the yeomen of the guard there wasone that enquired for Harry Tudor.Replied the yeoman, I know himvery well—if you please to go alongwith me, I’ll bring you to him im¬mediately.So the cobler followed the yeoman,admiring very much the prodigiousfinery of the rooms which he carriedhim through. He thought wimmhim self that the yeomen was mistakenin the person whom he enquired for ;for, said he, he whom I Iqok lor is aplain merry, honest fellow, his nameis Harry Tudor ; we drank two potstogether not long since. I suppose14he may belong to some lord or otherabout the court.I tell you, friend, replied the yeo¬man, I knovv him very well, do youbut follow me and I shall bring youto him straight.So going forward he came into theroom where the King was, accompa¬nied by several of the nobles attend¬ed him.As soon as the yoemen had put upby the orras, he spo.ce aloud. May itplease your Majesty here is one thatenquires for Harry Tudor.The cobler hearing this, thoughthe had committed no less than trea¬son : Therefore he up with his heelsand ran for it; but not being ac¬quainted with the several turningsan.d rooms through which he cane,he was soon overtaken, and broughtbefore the King ; whom the coblerlittle thought to be the person he eh-15qnired after ; therefore in a tremblingcondition he tell down on his knees,saying,May it please your grace, may itplease your highness, I am a pooreobler, and enquired for one HarryTudor, who is a very honest fellow,I mended the heel of his shoe not longsince for which he paid me nobly,and gave me two pots to boot, out,I had him afterwards to my sellar,where we drank part of p cup ofnappy ale, and ere very merry, tillmy wite Joan began to grumblewhich put an end to our merrimentfor that time, but 1 told him I wonldcome to the court and see him as soonas conveniently I could.r-Well, said the King, don’t be trou¬bled, do you kno w this honest fel¬low again, if you could see him ?The cobler replied, Yes, that I do,among a thousand.10Then said the King, Stand up andbe not afraid, but look well aboutyou, peradventure you may find thefellow in tins company.Whereupon the cobler arose andlooked wishfully upon the King andthe rest of his nobles, but it was tolittle or no purpose ; for though hesaw something in the King’s facewhich he thought he had seen before,yet he could not imagine him to beHarry Tudor whose shoe-heel hehad mended, and who had been somerry whh him at the inn, and athis own cellar.He therefore told the King he hadnot expected to find Harry Tudor a-mong such fine folks as he was there,but the person he looked for was aplain, merry, honest, and true-heart¬ed fellow. Adding withal, that h$was sure that did Harry i uaor butknow that he was come to court, hewould make him very welcome; for,,gays the cobler, when we parted, he17charged me to came to court soonand see him, which I promised Iwould, and accordingly I have madea holiday on purpose to have a glasswith him.At which speech of the cobler’s,the King had much ado to forebearlaughing out, but keeping his coun¬tenance as steady as he could beforethe cobler, he spoke to the yeomanof the guard.Here, said he, take this honestcobler down into my cellar, and lethim drink my good health—I willgive orders that Harry Tudor shallcome to him presently.So away they went, the coblerbeing fit to leap out of his skin forjoy, not only that he had come off vsowell, but that he should see hisfriend Harry Tudor.18CHAP. V. :The Cobier’s entertainment in theKing’s Cellar,The cobler had not been long inthe King’s cellar, before the Kingcame to him in the same habit thathe had on when the cobler mendedhis shoe ; whereupon the coblerknew him immediately, and ran andkissed him, saying.Honest Harry I have made an ho¬liday on purpose to see you but I hadmuch ado to get leave of my wifeJoan, who was loath to lose so muchtime from my work, but I was resol¬ved to see you, and therefore I mademyself as fine as I could. But I’lltell tfiee, Harry, when I came to courtI was in a peck of troubles how tofind you out ; but at last I met witha man who told me he knew you ve¬ry well, and that he would bring meto you ; but instead of doing so, he10brought mo before the King whichalmost frightened me out of my sev-i en senses : but faith I’m resolved tobe merry with you now since I havemet you at last.Ay, that we shall, replied the king,we will be as merry as princes.Now after the cobler had drunk a-bout four or five good healths, he be¬gan to be merry, and fell a-singinghis old songs and catches, whichpleased the king very much, andmade him laugh heartily.When on a sudden, several of thenobles came into the cellar, extraordi¬nary rich in apparel who all stood un¬covered before Harry Tudor, whichput the cobler into great amazementat first; but presently recovering him¬self, he looked more wishfully uponHarry Tudor, and soon knowinghim to be the King whom he saw inhe presence chamber, though in a-20nother habit, he immeditaly fell u-pon his knees, saying,May it please your Grace, may itplease your Highness, I am a poorhonest cobler, and mean no harm.No, no, said the King, nor shallyou receive any here, I assure you,He then commanded him to rise,and be as merry as he was before ;and though he knew him to be theKing, yet he should use the samefreedom with him as he did whenhe mended the heel of his shoe-This kind speech of the King’s,and three or four glasses of wine,made him be in as good humour ashe was before, telling the King sev¬eral of his droll stories, ",nd singingsome of his best songs, very muchto the satisfaction of the King and°11 his nobles.21THEeOBLER’S SONGrIN THEKING’S CELLAR.COME let its drink the other pot,our sorrows to confound ;We’ll laugh and sing before the Kingso let his health go round.For I’m as bold as bold can be,no cobler e’er was ruder ;Then here good fellow here’s to thee,rememb’ring Harry Tudor.When I’m at work within my stall,upon him I will think ;His kindness I to mind will call,whene’er I eat or drink.22His kindness was to me so great,the like was never known,His kindness I shall still repeat,And so shall my wife Joan.I’ll laugh when I sit in my stall,and merrily will sing,That I with my poor last and awl,am fellow with the king.But it is more, I must confessthan I at first did know :But Harry Tudor, ne’ertheless,• resolves it shall be so.And now farewell unto WhitehallI homeward must retire.To sing and whistle in my stall,my Joan will me desire.1 do but chink how she will laugh,when she hears of this thing.That he that drank her nut brown,was finglana’s royal king, (a!23CHAP. VI.How the Cobler became a Cou'rtier.Now the king considering the plea¬sant huinour of the cobler, how inno¬cently n erry he was, and free fromany designs j that he was a personthat labored very hard, and took agreat deal of pains for a small liveli¬hood, was pleased out of his princelygrace and "favor, to allow him a libe¬ral annuity- of~fofty!'* merks *a*year,for the better support of his jolly hu¬mour, and" tne mair tainance of hiswife Joan ; and tl at he should be ad¬mitted one of his courtiers, and thathe might have the freedom of hiscellar, whenever he pleased.24'Which being so much beyond ex¬pectation, did highly exalt the cob¬ier’s humour, much to the satisfac¬tion ot the King.So after a great many legs andscrapes he returned home to his wifeJoan, «vith the joyful news of hisreception at court; which so wellpleased her, that she did not thinkmuch at the great pains she took indecking him for the journey.astXU-cfiven.

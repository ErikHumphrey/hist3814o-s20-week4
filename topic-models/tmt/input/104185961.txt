that ever it was sac,She long’d to see the morning gift.That her good lord to her ga’e.When steeds were saddled and weel bridled,An’ ready for to ride,There came a pain on that gude lord,His back likewise his side.He said, “ Ride on, my lady fair.May goodness be your guide.For I am so sick and weary thatNo farther can I ride.”Now ben did come his father dear,Wearing a golden band.Says, “ Is there na leech in EdinburghCan cure my son from wrang?”0 leech is come and leech is gane^Yet, father, I’m aye waur ;There’s not a leech in Edinbro’Can deatli from me debar.But be a friend to my wife, father,Restore to herdier own,Restore to her her morning gift,Strathbogie and Aboyne.It had been gude for my wife, father,To me she’d borne a son.He would have got my lands and rents.Where they lie out and in.8“ It had been gude for my wife, father.To me she’d borne an heir ;He would have got my lands and rentsWhere they lie fine and fair.”The steeds they strave into their stables,The boys could not get them bound.The hounds lay howling on the beach,’Cause their master was behind." I dream’d a dream since late yestreen,I wish it may be good.That our chamber was full of swine.An’ our bed full of blood.“ I saw a woman come from the west.Full sore wringing her hands,And aye she cried, Ohon. alas!My good lord’s broken bands." As she came by my gude lord’s bowerSaw mony black steeds and brown,—I'm feared it be mony unco lordsHaving my love from town." As she came by my gude lord’s bower.Saw mony black steeds and grey,—I’m fear’d it’s mony unco lordsHavin’ my love to the clay.”

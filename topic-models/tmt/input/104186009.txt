Besidesbeing a healthy and delightful amusement, it hasbeen the means, in the hands of Providence, ofsaving thousands of valuable lives from a waterygrave.It is entirely owing to the want of,proper in¬structions and practice, that man cannot swimwith the same facility as many of the inferior ani¬mals, which seem to be led by instinct to use theproper action for their preservation, while rationalcreatures, being aware of their danger, grow fear¬ful or impatient, and begin to struggle, whichhas the effect of making them sink in the water.The first thing that must be learnt, is to divestvourself of all fear; and then, if you follow theinstructions given in this little Work, and prac¬tise them frequently, you will soon attain thepleasant Art of Swimming, which, once obtained,you can never forget.The following instructions of the great Dr.Frankun, are worthy of being studied and putin practice by every one who wishes to acquir jfthe art:—Dr Franklin’s Advice To Bathers.1The only obstacle to improvement in this ne¬cessary and life-preserving art is fear; and it isonly by overcoming this timidity, that you carexpect to become a master of the preceding ac¬quirements. It is very common for novices inthe art of swimmnig- to make use of corks or blad-ders to assist in keeping the body above the wa¬ter. Some have utterly condemned the use ofthese; however, they may be of service for sup¬porting the body while one is learning what iscalled the stroke, or that manner of drawing inand striking out the hands and feet that is neces¬sary to produce progressive motion. But youwill be no swimmer till you can place confidencein the power of the water to support you; I wouldtherefore advise the acquiring that confidence inthe first place, especially as I have known sev¬eral, who, by a little of the practice necessary forthat purpose, have insensibly acquired the stroke,taught as it were by nature. The practice Imean is this : Choosing a place where the water' leepens gradually, walk coolly into it till it is upto your breast; then turn your face round to theshore, and throw an egg into the water, betweenyou and the shore; it will sink to the bottom,5and be easily seen there, if the water is clear.It must lie in the water so deep as that you can¬not reach it to take it up but by diving for it.To encourage yourself in order to do this, reflectthat your progress will be from deep to shallowwater; and that at any time you may, by bring¬ing your legs under you, and standing on thebottom, raise your head far above the water;then plunge under it with your eyes open, whichmust be kept open before going under, as youcannot open your eyelids for the weight of waterabove you, throwing yourself toward the egg,and endeavouring by the action of your handsand feet against the water, to get forward tillwithin reach of it. In this attempt you will findthat the water buoys you up against your inclin¬ation ; that it is not so easy a thing to sink asyou imagined, and that you cannot but by activeforce get down to the egg. Thus you feel thepower of the water to support you, and learn toconfide in that power, while your endeavours toovercome it, and to reach the egg, teach you thismanner of acting on the water with your feet andhands, which action is afterwards used in swim¬ming to support your head higher above the water,or to go forward through it.I would the more earnestly press you to thetrial of this method, because, though I think I6have satisfied you that your body is lighter thanwater, dnd that Vou mitrht float in it a Ions: timewith your mouth free for breathing, if you wouldput yourself in a proper posture, and would bestill, and forbear struggling; yet, till you havedbfainetl this experimental confidence in the wa¬fer, t cannot depend on your having the neces¬sary presence of mind to recollect that postureand the directions I gave you relating to it. Thesurprise may put all out of your mind. Torthough we value ourselves on being rteasonablehhbwing creatures, reason and knowledge seem,on such occasions, to be of little use to us; andthe brutes, to whom we allow scarce a glimmer¬ing of either, appear to have the advantage ofus.I will, however, take this opportunity of repeat¬ing those particulars to you, which I mentionedin our last conversation, as, by perusing them atyour leisure, you may possibly imprint them soon your memory as on occasion to be of someuse to you.1. That though the legs, arms, and head, ofa human body, being solid parts, are specificallysomething heavier than fresh water, yet the trtirik,particularly the upper part, from its hollowness,is so much lighter than water, as that the wholeof the body taken together is too light to sink7wholly under water, but somte part w*ill remainabove, until the lungs become filled with water,which happens front drawing water intd them in-1 stead of air, when a person in the fright attemptsbreathing while the mouth and nostrils are underwater.2. That the legs and arms are specificallylighter than salt water, and wall be supported byit, so that a human body cannot sink in salt water,though the lungs were filled as above, but fromthe greater specific gravity of the head.3. That therefore a person throwing himselfon his back, in salt water, and extending his arms,may easily lie so as to keep his mouth and nos¬trils free for breathing ; and by a small motion ofj his hands may prevent turning, if he should per¬ceive any tendency to it.4. That in fresh water, if a man throw him¬self on his back, near the surface, he cannot longcontinue in that situation, but by proper actionof his hands on the water. If he uses no suchaction, the legs and lower part of the body willgradually sink till he comes into an upright posi¬tion, in which he will continue suspended, thehollow of his breast keeping the head uppermost.5. But if, in this erect position, the head iskept upright above the shoulders, as when westafid bn the ground, the immersion will, by the8weight of that part of the head that is out of theHwater, reach above the mouth and nostrils, per¬haps a little above the eyes, so that a man cannotlong remain suspended in the water with his headin that position6. The body continuing suspended as beforeand upright, if the head be leaned quite back, sothat the face looks upward, all the back part ofthe head being* then under water, and its weightconsequently in a great measure supported by it,the face will remain above water quite free forbreathing, will rise an inch higher every inspira¬tion, and sink as much every expiration, butnever so low as that the water may come overthe mouth.7. If, therefore, a person acquainted withswimming, and falling accidently into the water,could have presence of mind sufficient to avoidstruggling and plunging, and to let the body takethis natural position, he might continue long safefrom drowning, till perhaps help would come.For as to the clothes, their additional weight,while immersed is very inconsiderable, the watersupporting them, though, when he comes out ofthe water, he would find them very heavy indeed.But as I said before, I would not have you orany one to depend on having this presence ofmind on $uch an occasion, but learn fairly to swim,r9ias I wish all men were taught to do in their youth;they would on many occurrences be the safer forhaving that skill, and on many more the happier,as free from painful apprehensions of danger, tosay nothing of the enjoyment in so delightful andwholesome an exercise. Soldiers particularlyshould, methinks, all be taught to swim; it mightbe of frequent use either in surprising an enemyor saving themselves. And if I had now boysto educate, I should prefer those schools (otherthings being equal) where an opportunity wasafforded for acquiring so advantageous an art,which, once learned, is never forgotten.I know by experience, that it is a great com¬fort to a swimmer, who has a considerable dis¬tance to go, to turn himself sometimes on hisback, and to vary in other respects the means ofof procuring a progressive motion.When he is seized with the cramp in the leg,the method of driving it away is to give the partsaffected a sudden, vigorous, and violent shock ;which he may do in the air as he swims on hisback.During the great heats of summer there is nodanger in bathing, however warm we may be, inrivers which have been thoroughly warmed bythe sun. But to throw one’s self into cold springwater, when the body has been heated by exer-10cise in the sun, is an imprudence which may provfatal. I once knew an instance of four younimen, who having worked at harvest in the heaof the day with a view of refreshing themselvesplunged into a spring of cold water: two dietupon the spot,*a third the next morning, and thifourth recovered with great difficulty. A copiou.draught of cold water, in similar circumstancesis frequently attended with the same effect irNotth America.The exercise of swimming is one of the mosthealthy and agreeable in the world. After hav¬ing swam for an hour or two in the evening, onesleeps coolly the whole night, even during themost ardent heats of smmer. Perhaps the poresbeing cleansed, the insensible perspiration increas¬es and occasions this coolness. It is certain, thatmuch swimming is the means of stopping adiarrhoea and even of producing a constipation.With respect to those who do not know how toswim, or who are affected with a diarrhoea at aseason which dees not permit them to use thatexercise, a warm bath, by cleansing and purify^ing the skin, is found very salutary, and ofteneffects a radical cure. I speak from my own ex¬perience, frequently repeated, and that of othersto whom I have recommeded this.You will not be displeased if I conclude these11hasty remarKs by informing1 you, that as the or¬dinary method of wimming is reduced to the actof rowing with the arms and legs, and is conse¬quently a laborious and fatiguing operation whenthe space of water to be crossed is considerable,there is a method by which a swimmer may passto great distances with much facility, by meansof a sail. This discovery I fortunately made byaccident, in the following, manner.When I was a boy I amused myself one daywith flying a paper kite j and approaching thebank of a pond, which was near a mile broad, Itied the string to a stake, and the kite ascendedto a very considerable height above the pond,while I was swimming. In a little time, beingdesirous of amusing myself with my kite, and en¬joying at the same time the pleasure of swimming,I returned : and loosing from the stake the stringwith a little stick which was fastened to it, wentagain into the water, where I found that, lyingon my back, and holding the stick in my hands,I was drawn along the surface of the water in avery agreeable manner. Having then engageda boy to carry my clothes round the pond to aplace which I pointed out to him on the otherside, I began to cross the pond with my kite,which carried me quite over without the leastfatigue, and with the greatest pleasure imagin-able. I was only obliged occasionally to halt alittle in my course, and resist its progress, whenit appeared that by following too quick, I low¬ered the kite too much; by doing which occasion¬ally, I made it rise again. I have never sincethat time practised this singular mode of swim¬ming, though I think it not impossible to crossin this manner from Dover to Calais. Thepacket-boat, however, is still preferable.B. Franklin.GOING INTO THE WATER.Such persons as do not know how to swim,should go slowly into the water; but those whoare expert swimmers, may leap in at once, withtheir head or feet perpendicular; dr they mayhold their right hand, or both hands, behind theirneck, and throw themselves from the bank, headforemost, striking the water with the calves oftheir legs one after the other.The only inconvenience attending these me¬thods, is the danger of taking water at the noseand ears which may easily be prevented, by hol¬ding in the breath. Caution is requisite to alllearners, as it sometimes happens in expert swim¬mers that they strike against the bottom, whichis very disagreeable, and that in a great depthyou are obliged to hold in your breath a long13while; but this you may remedy, by turning onyour back when you begin to get near the bottom,as you will cease to descend when you begin toturn yourself. The coldness of the water is alittle troublesome at first, but in a short time itwears off.HOW TO BEGIN TO SWIM.When you have gone so far in that the waterreaches your breast, you are to put yourself in aright posture for swimming, by lying down gen¬tly on your belly, keeping your head and neckupright, your breast advancing forward, and yourback bending ; then withdraw your legs from thebottom stretching them out in imitation of a frog ;stretch out your arms also, and spread them open,then draw them in again towards your breast:strike forward as may strokes as you can, first withyour hands, and then with your feet, and you willfind this way easy and pleasant. Be not at all a-fraid lying along the water when you know thebottom. It will sometimes happen that you drinkdown some water, but that ought not to discourageyou, nor need you imagine that you are not as cap¬able of learning to swim as well as others, for thesame thing happens almost to all beginners ; forit is common at first learning, in lying along thewater, to sink down, and be ready to be stifled in14holding your breath. It is usual at first, forthese reasons, to administer sundry helps ; as, tobe assisted to hold up the chin, or procure a bun¬dle of cork or bladders, which are the best helpsfor young- beginners.Take special care that the water be not high¬er than your breast, nor shallower than up toyour belly.FLOATING,When you are upright in the water, lie downon your back very gently ; elevate your breast a-bove the surface of the water ; and, in the mean¬time, keep your body always extended in arightline, your hands stretched to the outside of thethighs, striking out and drawing in your legssuccessively, and keeping them within two feetof the surface of the water, and govern yourselfaccordingly. It is true, there will always be agreat part of the head under water, which makesmost beginners not care for this way ; notwith¬standing which, it is the most easy and safe me¬thod of swimming, and that wherein we maycontinue longest, for it least tires, and one is notforced to drink so much water as when swimmingon the belly : besides, we more easily cut throughthe waves, and run not so great a risk of beingentangled among weeds as on the belly. Atthe15beginning it will be found difficult, as you canscarce forbear using your hands. Take especialcare that you do not, through fear, put down oneof your legs to feel for the bottom : for, thoughyou need not fear sinking, such a motion of thefoot is the ready way to make you do so. Youmust also take care not to lift your knees too high,nor sink your hips and sides too low, but keepyour body extended in the same straight line as;already directed.The great evil in floating is, that one cannotsee properly what direction they are taking, andif one floats a long time without turning, he maycome in contact with some substance and be in¬jured; therefore, it is necessary to turn on thebelly frequently, and by changing from the backto the belly alternately, it will afford such reliefas to enable him to continue a long timp in thewater, before he is exhausted.TURNING.When you mean to turn while swimming inthe ordinary w7ay, it requires no farther troublethen to incline your head to the right or left sidewhich ever you w'ish to turn on, and throwing a-side the water with the arm and leg that is under¬most, in the same manner as one would do werehe wishing to turn himself in bed, or on the floor:16and in turning’ from floating to swimming onehas only to lower the side that he means to turnon, and embrace the water with the arm and legthat is uppermost; another way is, when you answimming bring your knees towards your bellyand let your body fall in the water till it come:to the perpendicular, then stretch out your hand:behind you, the feet are then to be forcibly structdownwards, and at the same time you are tcthrow yourself on your back; and in turning fromfloating to swimming allow the body to drop in¬to the water as above, stretch out your hands be¬fore you, and pressing your feet downwards, throwyourself on your belly.SWIMMING BACKWARDS.When lying on the back we push ourselvesonward with our feet and legs; but to do the con¬trary, and proceed forward, we must, lying alwayson the back, keep the body extended at fulllength in a straight line, the breast inflated, sothat the part of the back which is between theshoulders must be concave (or hollow) and sunkdown in the water; the hands on the belly. Be¬ing in this posture, you must lift up your legsone after another, and draw them back with allforce you can towards your hams, letting themfall into the water, for thus you will return to theplace whence you came. This way is not onlyvery pleasant, but also, when you find yourselfwearied with swimming, and far distant from theshore, it may be useful to rest yourself.DIVING.It men sink to the bottom of the water it istheir own fault, nature having lain no necessityon them of doing so; nay, there is not only oc¬casion for force and strength, but also art, to doit safely, speedily, and handsomely; but thosewho are expert at swimming do it, on occasion,as swift as an arrow ,and descend perpendicularlyor obliquely as they please. The first way ofdoing it is, to begin standing on your feet touch¬ing the bottom; then afterwards rise up, yourhead bowed down, so that your chin must touchyour breast, the crown of your head being turnedtowards the bottom, holding the backs of yourhands close together, right before your head, andsinking or striking them down first with all theswiftness and exactness you can : and thus youmay dive to the bottom.SWIMMING UNDER WATER.In the first place, you are to determirre whetheryou are to swim at the bottom ol the water, ornear the surface, or in the middle. You first of18all divd- down, the two hands must be turned hacktb back, hnd close to one another; after whichyou must extend them with all the swiftness youcan, your thumbs turned upwards, and your fdfe-fingers towards the bottom ; and if you have amind to descend yet lower, you must, as yourhands are extended, still strike them down lowerin the water. If, cantrariwise, you would reas-eend towards the surface of the Water, von mustkeep the palms of your hands open, and yourthumbs towards one another, as when you swimon your belly; the palms of your hands beingtowards the bottom, and your twm thumbs, as Ihave just now said, towards one anothei-. liethat would swim in the middle, or between fopand bottom, must grasp with both his arms thewater before him, attracting it towards him, keep¬ing in the mean while his thumbs turned moletowards, the bottom of the water than the rest ofhis hands. You may have Occasion to swim thus,when you are to seek for any tiling at the bot¬tom of the water, or to paiss unseen from oneshore to another; sometimes to Helb one in din¬ger of being drowned. But in this last case; youmust take care not to come too near, neither un¬der witer, nor on the surface, to any one in thatdanger, for if such a one takes hold of you; youarfe iti great clanger of being lost.VOTo proceed therefore in that case safely, youmust keep at a distance, as fen or twelve feet off;your best way will be not to lay hold of him tillhe is quite sunk down, and lost the use of hissight; and if you have observed the place wherehe is, you may endeavour to take hold of him bythe hair, and so draw him on your back, takingcare always that he does not lay hold of you, orotherwise hamper you. You may thus draw himto some shallow place : or if you have any stringor rope about you, leave one end on the shore inthe hands of your companions, and fasten theother to him, and so let them draw him out.SWIMMING LIKE A DOG.You are not to imagine that this way is diffi¬cult, for it is so far from it, that several who neverknew how to swim before, by practising it bychance, have kept themselves above water. ToI swim like a dog, you must lift up and depress oneIhand successively alter another, and do the sametslso with your feet, only with this difference,that with your hands you must draw the watertowards von, Uud with your feet drive it from you ;ie<»in with the right hand and right foot, and af-:erwards with the left hand and foot, and so sue-■essivelv. This way of swimming is Very Usefulor disengaging yourself from weeds under water.20TO BEAT THE WATER.You strike the water with your right and leftlegs, when swimming on the back, at each exten¬sion of the legs, lifting them up out of the waterone after another, you strike the water so that itstarts into the air. Those who are most expertat this bring their chins towards their breast ateach extension. There are some who, not satis¬fied with going so far, only, to perform the bus¬iness more gracefully, lift up their legs higherthan others, strike the water at each extention,sometimes with the right leg, sometimes with theleft, and at the same time turn the whole body.This is the most agreable manner of all. To per¬form this, you must keep your body extended onyour back, expand or inflate your breast, and keepit almost out of the water, the palms of both yourhands extended and turned towards the bottom;for it is the office of the hands to keep up the bodywhile you strike and open your legs; but if at thesame time you have a mind to beat water, andturn yourself, in that case, supposing your rightleg is up out of the water, you must strike thewater with that, and at the same time lift up theleft leg, and by the same action turn your wholebody. This agility makes swimming very easy,and does not require so much force as the fol¬lowing.21TO SHOW BOTH FEET OUT OF THEWATER.One may swim holding both feet out of thewater, and this is very easy ; you may also notonly remain so in one place, but also make advan¬ces forward. You must place yourself on theback, and bend the small of it contrariwise towhat is practised in other ways of swimming;your hands must be on your belly, the palms ofthem open, moving them to and fro, like oars,v/hich must sustain your body while your feet areshown. This way of swimming serves to show'you whether your feet are clean or not, after hav¬ing taken them from the bottom.TO TREAD THE WATER.By this way you remain upright in the waterwithout making any motion with your hands,only you move the water round with your legsfrom you, the soles of your feet being perdendi-cular to the bottom: you may make use of thisif you are cast into the water bound hand andfoot. Swimming on the belly is also serviceablein this rencounter. Treading the water is veryadvantageous, for it leaves us the free use of ourhands. One may make use of it in defendingone’s self; but it ought not to be practised wherethe bottom is full of rushes or weeds, for they22may entangle one or even both of the egs; andin such case you may use the following.method.TO SWIM HOLDING UP ONE LEG.This way seems at lirst to be the same withthat of showing the feet out of the water, whichwe have already taught, but it is very differentfrom it; for while you hold Up one of your legs,both your hands rhust embrace and gather to¬gether, as it were, the waters, striking them un¬der youj and driving them off; the other leg mustnot be lifted Up above half-way, beating thewater frequently therewith, by quick and shortstrokes. This is an easy Way to carry any thingfrom one side of a river to the other, by fasten¬ing it to your great toe: but you may performthe same thing inor6 easily, as follows:—TO SWIM HOLDING UP BOTHHANDS.While you swim on your back, it is easy to pUtyour hands to what use you please, but it is diffi¬cult to hold them upright; and swim at the sametime too. It would appear at first sight as if thisweffe the most easy method we have yet taught.You riiust take care, lest while you lift up yourarms, the thorax or breast be not contracted, forin that case yon sink. The whole art of this way23of swimming consists in heaving up the breast ashigh, and keeping it inflated as much as possible,while your arms are held up.TO SUSPEND YOURSELF BY THECHIN.You cannot easily imagine how thhs manner ofswimming is performed, as it is indeed very sur¬prising. By this means you may Stand uprightin the water, though ever so deep, without fearof sinking. To make you comprehend it, youare to remember, that when you swim On your1 Back, you lie still, yoUr legs .being extended;I when you find yourself ifi that posture, you musti| let your legs go down or sink; and when theyi Come to be perpendicular to the bottom, you musttake them up again, bending your knees, and in-Iflating your breast; and as to the arms and hands,I thereof the back parts lie flat on the water bythe shoulders, you must sometimes extend them(bn the one side, sometimes on the other, some-1 times shut them, turning the palms towards thekittom, the fingers close to one another, holding1 fbUr chin as Upright as possible. This way,much Seems so surprising, is sometimes very use-|ul; Suppose, at any'- time, the ibe should happenf break under your feet, this way will be of vast[vantage to secure yourself from the danger.24It may also bo very advantageous in case a manis obliged to save himself from some enemy pursu¬ing him, by leaping into the water in a dark night.for in that case one may wait, without makingany noise, till he has passed by, and then go a-gain on shore.TO SWIM ON THE BELLY, HOLDING BOTH HANDSSTILL.This is easily performed in the following man¬ner. You must keep your breast advancing for¬ward ; your neck upright on the water, both yourhands fast behind your head, or on your back,while in the meantime, your legs, and thighs pushyou forwards by the same motions you make iwhen you swim on your belly. This mode of iswimming may be useful in case of any accident,as the cramp, &c. should happen to your arms,or if you were forced to swim with your handstied behind you, and your life depended on it.The same thing- may be performed by placingyourself on your back, but the other way is mostadvantageous, because you may see your way be¬fore you; and those that swim on their backare obliged to turn themselves often for that,purpose. Besides the hands are here at rest,but must be employed if you turn yourself onyour back.ITNIS.

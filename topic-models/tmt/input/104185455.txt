ROBERTSON,Saltmarket, 1805.( 2 ;APLAIN DESCRIPTIONO FJERUSALEM.JERUSALEM was a principal city inJofhua’s time, when Adonibezek wasking, who was flain by him ; yet the Jebu-fites held it for four hundred years alter, tillDavid won it; though the inhabitants boaft-ed that their blind and their lame would de¬fend it, 2 Sam. v. 6. David ftrengthened itwith a caftle, and beautified it with palaces;after this Solomon enlarged it, and furtherbeautified and fortified it; the palace gatesand wails could not be matched in all theworld. It had within the walls one hundredand fifty thoufand inhabitants, befides wo¬men and children.The trenches about it were fixty feet deepcut out of the rock, and two hundred and fif¬ty broad. Not long aft'3’- Shilhak king ofEgypt took it, and bee: mailer of Solo¬mon’s riches, and of ah David’s fpoil,which he had taken from many nations, 2Kings ;dv& It was again plundered, and partJerufakm's Captivities Lamented. 3of the wall broken down, by Joafh king ofIfrael, in Amaziah’s reign, 2 Kings xvh Notlong after, Ahaz, the fifteenth king of Judah,impoverilhed the temple, to prefent Tiglath-pilnezer with the treafures thereof, and Ma-nafieh loft what remained, 1 Chron. v.And Nebuchadnezzar laid this gloriouscity with the temple, palace, walls andtowers, even with the ground, 2 Kings xix.After eighteen month’s fiege, in the eleventhyear of Zedekiah, the ninth day of the fourthmonth, which was the eighteenth year ofNebuchadnezzar’s reign, the princes of Ba¬bylon furprifed and took this brave city jI prefentiy after Nebuzar-aden, general of theBabylonian army, commanded by Nebuchad¬nezzar, fpoiled the temple, carrying awaythe veffels of gold and filver, and the greatlaver, given by king Solomon, and burnt thetemple the firft day of the next month, whichwas twenty-one days after the furprifal, 470years, fix months, and ten days after thefoundation; 903 years, fix months, and tendays after the departure of the people out ofEgypt; 1760 years, and fix months after theflood; 35*6 years, fix months, and ten daysafter the creation. Thus, and then was thecity of Jerufalem taken, and for feventy yearsthe Jews remained in this captivity.it was built again by Nehemiah, 2 Chron*i, ii, iii, iv. The temple and city were fpoiledf; again by Burgofes, lieutenant to Artaxerx-es,4 Jerufalem's Captivities Lamented.es, then by Ptolerreus the firft, then by An-tiochus Epiphanes, and again by Appolio-jiius’ deputy; after which, it was taken byPompey, and robbed by Craflus, in his Par¬thian expedition. Yet all the lodes the tem¬ple and city fuftained, were repaired by He¬rod the Great, who enlarged the city, new-built the temple, and left it both ftately andglorious ; it was compaffed with three ftrongwalls, the third wall had ninety towers, thefecond wall had fourteen, and the old wallhad fixty. Agrippa built a fourth wall tencubits high, but did not finilh it, left Clau¬dius Csefar fhould think he defigned to re¬bel ; yet the Jews afterwads built it twentycubits high, and raifed a battlement two cu¬bits : and built three towers thereon: all their7 4towers were built of white marble, eachftone being twenty cubits long, ten broad,and five thick, fo curiouily joined, that theyi'eemed but one ftone, and the compafs ofthe city from the north to the weft, was for¬ty-three furlongs.Within the city was the King’s palace,furpafting all in the world for larger) efs andworkmanlhip, environed with a wall, whichwas thirty cubits high, adorned with towers,and beautified with houfes to an hundred ofthe nobility; and in every room were manyveftels of gold and ftlver, and porches adorn¬ed with curious pillars, and many pleafantwalks, with all manner of trees and foun¬tains.'Jerufalem's Captivities Lamented. 5tains, which fpouted out water, with cifterns:and brazen ftatues, from which water rancontinually.The temple was built upon a rocky moun¬tain, and the place at the top, was not atfirft big enough for the temple and court,the hill being very lleep, but the people eve-| ry day brought earth thither, and they atlalt made it plain and large enough, withwonderful curicftty and labour, enciofed with! three walls, which vrere many days labour,with the coll of all the holy treafure offeredto God from all parts; the foundation of thetemple was laid three hundred cubits deep ;the porches were double fupported by manypillars twenty cubits high, all of one pieceof marble ; thi tops of cedar To exa&lyun-ought, as allonilhed beholders, the porch¬es were thirty cubits broad, and the compafsof the temple was fix furlong^: The courtswere curioufly paved and wrought with allforts of Hones, and the gates were coveredwith weighty plates of gold, only one withCorinthian brafs, which for beauty excelledthe others, dazzling the eyes of the fpec-tators.Then the Sanctum Sanctorum, or Ho¬ly of Holies, fituated in the midft, had twelveHairs to go up to it, the fore-part of it wasan hundred cubits high, and as many broad,and backwards it was forty cubits on eachfide. It had as it were two flioulders twentycubits6 yerufalem*s Captivities Lamented.cubits high, and twenty-five wide, and hadno doors, to fhew that heaven was alwaysopen. All the fore-parts were gilded with¬in and covered with fine gold, the inner partwas divided into two rooms, whereof thefirfi: only might be feen, which was in heightninety cubits, in length forty, and in breadthtwenty. F.ound about the wall was a gold¬en vine, whereon hung grapes in clufters,being fix feet long; it had golden gates fifty-five cubits high, and iixteen broad, and cu¬rious hangings of the fame length, wroughtwith purple, velvet, fcarlet, and filk. Allthe fabric was fo exquifite and rich, thatnone could imagine any w’orkrnanfhip to bewanted, for it was all covered with mafiyplates of gold, w hich aftonithed the behold¬ers ; the top affo was fet with rods of gold,fharp at the ends, left birds ftioulu fit there¬on, and defile the holy place.Our SAVIOUR was born in the yearof the world 4004, and in the 43d year ofAuguftus Caefar; many remarkable thingswere feen in the heavens, which caufed thewife men to conclude, that fome more thanan ordinary perfon wpuld appear upon theearth: The learned thought it to be Auguf¬tus Csefar, who then reigned profperoufly;but others thought it to be he whom theprophet Ifaiah fpeaks of, that fhould havethe government on his fhoulders, even theSaviour of the world, whom the Evangeliftsmention.'Jerufakirfs Captivities Lamented. 7mention, that the angels declared to thefhepberds. and the ftar direfted the wife menof the eaft to find put the place of his birth»So that,ds the new Earth with a new San was blejl^So Heaven with a new glorious Star was dr eft.At Chrill’s birth, the temple at Rome,dedicated to the god Pan, fell to the earth;and when it was built, the Romans addrefs-ed the oracle of Apollo, to know how longit fhould endure; who anfwered, “ Till a“ Virgin fhould bring forth a fon,” whichthey judged impoflible, therefore they believ¬ed that their temple fhould laft eternally.The night that Chrift was born, there ap¬peared in Spain at midnight, a clond withfo great a light, that it feemed like mid-day.1 St. Jerom writes, that when the Virgin fledwith her Son into Egypt, all the Images ofthe Gods tumbled from their altars to thevery ground: and that the Oracles, or An-fwers which thefe Gods, or rather Devils,ufed to give them, ceal'ed,'and never an¬fwered afterwards.In the firft year after CHRIST’S birth,many firange things happened in Germa¬ny, and in Rome, and a terrible eclipfeof the fun.

Athis death there was a mighty darknefs in theday time, from fix till nine, that is, from ourtwelve, to our three in the afternoon, andyet no eclipfeof the fun, it being full moon;fo it was contrary to the order of nature,but the power of God d *<prived the fun ofhis light.Dionyfius the Areooagite, being that day inAthens, and feeing the darknefs, cried witha loud voice, “ Either the world is at anCi end, or the God of nature fufFers.” Thenthe men of Athens, being aftcnifhed, builtan altar to the UNKNOWN GOD;and afterwards St. Paul declared to. them,• 4 That Chrift,’ who fuffered that day, ‘ was‘ the Unknown God ;* whereby he convert¬ed many to the Chrififian faith.Itio Jerufalm’s Captivities Lamented,It is likewife acknowledged by Plutarch,though a Tleathen, that after the death ofChrift, not only the oracles of Egypt ceafedbut through all the world, for which he can.gdve no reafon, being ignorant of Chriftian-5'ty; however Satan did plainly acknowledgehimfelf overcome by the death of Ghjift,and could never give any anfwers afterwards.The words of Plutarch to Emiiius the oratorconcerning the matter, are as follows.<£ My father coming by fea towards Italy,et and coalting by night about an ifland not6i inhabited called Paraxis: When moft iniC the {hip were at reft, they heard a fearfulsc voice which came from that ifland, that“ called upon Alaman, who was pilot of the*:e {hip, and an Egyptian born; though thisvoice was heard once or twice, yet no man61 had the courage to anfwer it till the third<c time when the pilot anfwered, Who is“ there ?

The citizens,being weary of this tyranny, delivered thecity to Simon, thinking he would help them,but he joined the other rebel, and they reign¬ed month about, till at lafl: they quarrelledbetween themfelves.Then there uTas nothing but daughter andbloodfned, fo that the blood of the Jews ranthrough the llreets, even to the temple ofthe LORD, like a flood : Ail that the fedi-tious overcame they fet their houfes on fire,ao that they burnt fourteen hundred Itore-jhoufes, that were full of corn, wine, andoil, which caufed a hidden famine in Jeru-ialem. Thus GOD vifned the city withfour plagues at once, viz. fword, peftilence,famine, and fire: to which the fifth was add¬ed, the ruin and d* ftru&ion of all the glo-rous buildings fo that nothing but defola-tion, pollution of the Temple, and all holythings, and uproar without any red; nohelp, no fuccour, but every corner was full1 o.Jerufalem’s Captivities Lamented. 13of howling, yelling, weeping, wailing, fob¬bing and fighing of women, children, andaged men ftarving for want of bread,- andothers roaring in their wounds; fo that ailmanner of miferies oppreffed the inhabitants,and he was thought a happy man who wasdead before that day.At this time Vefpafian with his army,was lying in Galilee, and from thence hewent to Rome to receive the Imperial Crown,and left his fon Titus, with the half of hisarmy to beliege Jerufdem, the other to tar¬ry at Alexandria til) further orders, “ That I“ (hall do (faid Titus) dear father, for unto“ you it belongeth to command, and for mew to obey.”In the firft: year of the reign of Vefpafian,Titus muftered his army, and found themfufficient for the fiege of Jerufalem. He thenmarched to Samaria, and from thence to Ate-! Ionia, thirty furlongs from Jerufalem, wherehe pitched his camp, and the next day hebrought his whole army to Jerufalem a lit¬tle before the feaft of unleavened bread,which was April the 14th, fo that an infinitenumber of people, who came to celebrate,were all fhut up in the city, which raifed afamine; oxen’s dung was fold at a deari. rate, fo was old leather; and fome women,for want, boiled their children and did eatthem.Now Titus approached the walls of thecity.3 4 JeruJaletfs Captivities Lamented.eity, and pitched his camp upon the riverPoleponina, raifed a mount, and with a bat¬tering ram broke into the city. May yth,and afterwards he raifed four other mounts,and made himfelf mailer of the fecond wall,and l^ilt twelve caftles thereon, fo that nonecould pafs in or out, whereby the famineand peftilence raged within, and the fwordwithout the city fo t$at multitudes peril¬ed ; for, from April the 14th, to July fol¬lowing, there were buried, by the commoncharge of the city, fix hundred thoufandcarcafes, and multitudes thrown into emptyhoufes, and over the walls, which filled thehoufes with dead bodies.Titus intended to fave the Temple fromfire, when fome of the city was in flames,by fetting a guard on it, but the feditiouswho raifed the fire, flew every man of theguard which Titus hearing, brought hiswhole army thither. At that time a foldierof the feditious took a flaming fire-brand,and call it through the golden window intothe Temple, and others fet fire to the doors,and after the gold grew hot, the Templebegan to burn, and immediately the wholefabric was in a flame, and the HOLY ofHOLIES was laid open to the view of allthere prefent.This happened in the fecond year of thereign of Vefpafian, and the fame month thatit was burnt by Nebochadn'ezzar. TitusdrewJerufalenfs Captivities Lamented. 15drew his fword to fave the holy place, butthe flames rufhed through all parts of theTemple in a moment, fo that none could1 fave it The Jews feeing all go to deftruc-tion before their eyes, they thin threw them-felves into the flames, faying, t£ Why Ihould“we live any longer? Now there was no“ Temple.** After the Holy of Holies wasburnt, Titus entered it, and faw the glory ofit and faid, “ I well perceive, that this is no“ other than the HOUSE of GOD, and the“ dwelling place of the KING of Heaven:“ The God of Heaven who is God of this“ Houfe, take vengeance on the feditious,“ whofe heinous de<-ds have brought this e-“ vil upon themfelves, and this holy place.’*On the 7th of September, Titus com¬manded all the lower city to be fet on fire,and afiaulted the upper city, breaking overtheir fences, and deflroying all before himwith fire and fword; then he commanded thecity and temple to be razed to the founda¬tion, and the ground to be forthwith plow¬ed And Jehohanan and Simon were lentprifoners to Rome, with feven hundred of~ the Jews: The Book of the Law, and thePurple Veil of the Sanctuary were taken intriumph to Rome. About that time neitherfun nor moon appeared for fifteen days asChrift foretold, Matth. xxiv. 15.St. Jerom writes, that in his time, on thatday of the year wherein Jerufalem was takenbyi‘6 Jerufalem's Captivities Lamented.by the Romans, you might have feen agedmen and women, and feveral other wretch¬ed people, who, with blubbered .cheeks anddiflievelled hair, went howling and lament¬ing for the ruin of the Temple and San&u-ary, wearing, and bearing-in their habits andbodies, the fad chara&er of divine venge¬ance, of whom the foldiers exacted a feefor liberty of weeping; and they who for¬merly fold the blood of Jefus, were now for¬ced to buy their own tears, without beingpitied.The Roman foldiers, being now quite fpentwith doing execution, and having a greatdeal mere of their work yet to do, Titus or¬dered his men to hold their hands, favingonly to thofe 'whom they found armed, or ina pofture of reiiftance, and to give quarterto all the reft. But the Soldiers went beyondtheir commifiion, and put the aged and fick-ly to the fword, promifcuoufly with theircompanions ; and for thofe that were ftrongand ferviceable, they ftmt them up in thetemple, in the women's quarter. Ctelar ap¬pointed Fronto, one of his friends and free¬men to inform him of the people, and todo by them as they deferved. As for theruffians, and the feditious, that impeachedone another, he had them all put to death ;but for men of comely and graceful perfons,and in the prime of their youth, he referv-ed them for the triumph j fending away allaboveJerufakm*s Captivities Lamented. 17;*bove fevehteen years of age of the remainder| of them in chains into Egypt, to be employedIin fervile offices and drudgery: befides thofethat were diftributed up and down the pro¬vinces for the ufe qf the theatres in the qualityof fwords-men or gladiators j and all underI feventeen he expofed to faie.In the mean time, while the prifonersw-ere under Fronto’s charge, there were e-leven thoufand of them ftarved to death, be¬twixt the churlifhnefs of the keepers, thatwrould give them no meat, and the fqueam-iihnefs of their ftomachs that would fwallownone. But in truth the mouths were toomany for the provifions.The number of prifoners in this war wasninety feven thoufand. The number of thedead was eleven hundred thoufand; thegreater part of them Jews by nation, thoughI not natives of Judea ; For it was only a ge¬neral meeting of them at Jerufalem, gather¬ed together from all quarters to celebratethe feaft of the paffover; who w'ere then,furprifed into a war. There was fuch a pro¬digious multitude, and they fo ftraitened forlodgings, that the croud firft brought theplague into the town, and then quickly madeway for a famine. The city not being capa¬ble of entertaining that vaft body of people,if the calculation of Ceflius may at leall pafsj for any thing : As follows,Ner©18 Jerufalem’s Captivities Lamented,Nero had fo great a contempt for theJews, that Ceitius made it his fuit to the highpriefts to bethink themfelves of fome way ofnumbering their people j and this he didout of a defire to give Nero to underftand,that the Jewifh nation was not fo defpicabUas he imagined $ fo that they took their timeto enter upon the computation, at the cele¬bration of their pafchal feaft j When offer¬ing up facrifice to be eaten afterwards, inthe ninth hour of the day to the eleventh;and the facrifice to be eaten afterwards, intheir families, by ten at leaft, and fometimestwenty to a lamb; they reckoned upon twohundred and fixty-fix thoufand, five hun¬dred oblations; which at the rate of ten to aIamb, amounted to two millions, fix hundredand fixty-five thoufand perfons, all pure andfound. For neither lepers, fcorbutf*;, mentroubled with gonnorhceas, women in theirmonthly ficknefs, or propie labouring underany malignant diftempers, were admitted toany part, in this folemnity: No more wereany Grangers, but what came thither for re¬ligion. So that this mighty concourfe ofpeople from abroad before the fiege, wasafterwards by the righteous Providence ofGod, cooped up in that city, as in a prifon :And the number of the ilain in that fiege,was the heavieft judgement of that kind thatever was heard of. Some were killed open¬ly, others kept in cuftody by the Romans,whojerttfalem's Captivities Lamented. 19who fearched the very fepulchres and vaults• for them, and put all they found alive to thefword. There were upwards of two thou-fand that had either laid violent hands onthemfelves, or killed one another by confent;befides thofe that perilhed by the famine.The putrid corruption of dead bodies lentout a vapour to poifon as many as camewithin the reach of it. Some were not ableto endure it, and fo went out of the way;, others had their hearts fo fet upon booty,that they rifled the very carcafes, and tram¬pled upon the dead bodies as they lay foak-ing in their corruption: but avarice fticks atnothing. They brought out feveral prifonersalfo that the two tyrants had laid in chainsthere; for they kept up their cruelty to thelaft: but God’s juftice overtook them bothin the end; for John and his brethren, inthe vaults were now driven by the difirefs1 of an unfupportable hunger, to beg thatmercy of the Romans, which they had fooften defpifed: And Simon, after a longftruggle with an infupportable necefiity, de¬livered up himfelf. The latter being referv-ed for the triumph, and the former made pri-foner for life.

Bythefe means, the Romans became mafters ofthree impregnable forts by fortune, that couldnever have been taken any other way: Forthe three famous towers before mentionedwere proof againft all battery. -Upon Simon and John’s quitting thefetowers; or rather, upon their being drivenout of them, by the impulfe of judicial infa¬tuation, they haftened away to the vale ofSiloa, where they took breath a while, andafter fome recollecfion, and refrefhment, theygave an aifualt to the new wall there: Butfo faint and weak, that the guard beat themoff; for between fatigue, defpondency, dread,and mifery, their llrength failed them, andthey were then fcattered feveral ways in finksand gutters.The foldiers were now broken loofe, allover the town, up and down in the ftreets,with their fwords drawn; killing all that fellan their way without diflindion ; and burn¬ing entire houfes, and whatever was in them,in one common flame. In feverai placeswhere they entered to fearch for pillage, theyfound whole families dead, and h#ules cram¬med with hunger-ftarved carcafes: So thatupon the horror of fo hideous a fpe&acle.Jerufalem's Captivities Lamented. 21they came out again empty-handed: but thecompaflion they had for the dead, made themnot one jot tenderer to the living; for they| ftabbed every man they met, till the narrowpaffages and alleys were choaked up withcarcafes ; fo that the channels of the city ranblood as if it had been to quench the fire.In the evening they gave over killing, and atnight they fell afrefli to burning.The eighth of the month Gorpieus putan end to the conflagration of Jerufalem,(A. D. 70.) and if all the bleffings it everenjoyed, from the foundation of it, had beenbut comparable in proportion to the calami¬ties it fuffered in this fiege, that city hadbeen undoubtedly the envy of the world.But the greateft plague of all came out ofits own bowels ; in that infernal race of vi¬pers that it brought forth to eat out thebelly of the mother.While Titus was now taking a view of theruins of this glorious city: the works, thefortifications, and efpecially the turrets, whichthe tyrants had fo fottiftily abandoned: WhileCasfar, I fay, was entertaining himfelf in thecontemplations of the height, dimenfions, andfituations of thefe towers; the defign, work-manlhip, and cur-iofity of the fabric, withthe wonderful contrivance of the whole: Helet fall this expreflion, “ Well, fays he^ If“ God had not fought for us, and wfith us,‘‘ we could never have been mailers of thefe#£ forts.I . ~22 Jerufalem’s Captivities Lamented.“ forts.

Nor is itpoflibie, in the nature of things, that in anyother nation fuch vaft numbers (hould begotten, together, and perifli in the fiege ofany'JerufalenCs Captivities Lamented. 33any one city whatfocver, as now happened inJerufalem.Thus Jerufalem taken and utterly de*ftroyed, in the fecond year of Vefpafian,and on the eighth day of the month Gorpi-eus; having been five times taken before,i. e. by Azchasus king of Egypt: AntiochusEpiphanes, king of Syria ; Pompey and He¬rod, with Sofius: who did all preferve thecity after it was taken.

I am opprefs’djalas! alas! my grief’s renew’d.My very heart within my breaft,alas! will break for love of you.With ambrofialfpeeches & modeft fmile,Hie anfwered, you are but poor;My parent’s wrath I’m fure to gain,if I your perfon Ihould adore.Don’t be danton’d in the leaft love,frowns from your parents never fear,For I will work both day and night,all for to comfort you my dear.She faid your trade is very poor,for to maintain a family,But fince your heart’s in Cupid’s bands,I will confent and marry thee.4-This meeting being in a grove,it happ’ned in an ev’ning clear,Her aged father walking nigh,thele words he chanc’d to overhear.Then he call’d on this beautiful maid,likewife enraged moft paflionately.You barb’rous maid unto her he faid,will you difgrace my family ?0 father dear, then flie reply’d,don’t be hard hearted to my love,For had I all the Indian gold,there’s none but he that I could love.'

Fa, See.Sir, you appear a cunning man,but this fine plot you’ll fail in,For there is neither pat nor pan,of mine you’ll drive a nail in.Then bind your budget on your back,and nails up in your.apron;For I’ve a tinker under tack,that us’d to clout my caldron.

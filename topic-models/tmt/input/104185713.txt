TH£PLEASING ARTOKmoney-catchingAND THBWAY TO THRIVE,BYTURNING A PENNY TO ADVANTAGE :WITH A NEW METHOD OKREGULATING DAILY EXPENSESGLASGOW;PRINTED FOR THE BOOKSELLERSUBR4>^ OF SCOTLAND ^ND HTHISPLEASING ARTOffMONEY-CATCHING.When commerce and traffic was first begun inthe world, and men came to trade one with an¬other, there was no use for money, nor need ofit; for men bartered their goods in exchange witheach other; and as in the infancy of the world,some were tillers of the ground and others wTerekeepers of sheep; the one gave the other corn,and took of their sheep in exchange for it. Andthis sort of trading is now generally in use in ourforeign plantations, to supply the want of mon¬ey. But in process of time, as trading increased,so did luxury begin to abound ; and as luxury a-bounded, so men’s wants grew greater, whichbegat a necessity of some other way of commerce,and this was money; which is of such antiquity,that Josephus tells us, that Cain, (the son ofAdam, and the first born of men) was very greedyin gathering money together, though of whatmetal that money was made, and whether it wascoined or not he is silent.Herodotus writeth that the first *hat ooineddiver and gold, to buy and sell with, were theLydians. For silver and gold being the mostprecious of metals, were so much valued, thatwhatever any man wanted, might be purchasedfor it.Homer indeed tells us that before the siege ofTroy, men used to change or barter one commo¬dity for another. But it is undeniable that mon¬ey was in use long before that time; for whenAbraham purchased the field of Machpelah, andthe field in which it was, for a burying place forhis family, he gave four hundred shekels of sil¬ver for it: which the secret texts tells us wascurrent money with the merchant; and that wasabout the year of the world 2088, which wasnear 700 years before the destruction of Troy.But though the money was current with the mer¬chant, yet I question whether it was coined ornot; for it rather appears, that it received its valuefrom its weight than from any stamp, that wasupon it: the weight of an shekel being a quar¬ter of an ounce, and the true value of that 15pence of our money. Abraham paid £25 Eng¬lish money, for that burying place.We read likewise of pieces of silver, or silver-lings, before this, which was current money a-mong the nation at that day ; for Abimelech, kingof Gerar, having taking Abraham’s wife from him.5upon a fliipposidon t,hat she was his sister whe-ahe came to understand the truth of the matter,not only restored his wife to him again, but alsogave him a thousand pieces of silver or silverlings;the value of which thousand pieces (each piecebeing worth 2s 6d) came to £125-10s. which atthat day was a noble present for a king to give.But besides shekels and silverlings, there weretalents also, the weiglit of which was 75 ounces.A talent of silver contained the value of £ 18 7.10 4.Of each of these coins there is frequent mentionin the Holy Scriptures of the Old Testament.In the New Testament, Our Saviour command¬ed Peter to take up the fish that first came tohand, and when he had opened its mouth heshould find therein a piece of money, which hewas to take and give the tax-gatheiers for hisMaster and himself: which piece of money wascalled a Stator, which consisted of half an ouscaof silver, the value of which was 2 shillings.And when the Jews came to ensnare our Saviour,about the lawfulness of paying tribute to Caesar,he desired them to shew the tribute-money, andthey shewed him a penny, of value 7d-halfpenny ;and that this money was coined and stamped,appears by our Saviour’s asking them, whose im¬age and superscription was upon it ? to whichthey answered, Caesar.aBut I netni not quote Scripture to jMortj rhaithe Jews aud Romans used to coin money, theimago and superscription giving a value to it, andpromoting the currency of it; for silver was coineuin Rome, in the year of the world 3672, which)was about 300 years before the Christian sera. IHistory tells us that silver was first of all coin¬ed in the Isle Engina and that in Rome it wailstamped with the impression of a chariot and howses.. And Janus caused brass to be coined witha face on the one side, and a ship on the other,;in memory of Saturn us, who arrived there in tuship. Servius Tullius, a king of the Romans,first coined brass with the image of a sheep andan ox. And in some places leather cut into pie¬ces has had the stamp of authority put upon it,and so it was made to pass for money. And inNew England, the Indians have money whichthey call Wampompege, which is of two sorts,!one white, which they make of the stem or stock]of the periwinkle, which they call Meteauboekt,when all the shell is broken off; and of this sort!six of their small beads, (which they make w ithholes to string the bracelets) are current with thejEnglish for a penny. The other sort is blaekiinclining to blue, which is made of the shell of afish, which they call Pequanhock; and of thissort three make an English penny. They who7live upon the sea-side generally maite of it, audas many make as will, none being denied the li¬berty of making it. This coin of money the In¬dians set such a value upon, that they bring downall sorts of furs which they take in the country,and sell to the Indians and English too, for thisIndian money; and the currency of it amongthem, makes them look on it as a good equival¬ent for what commodites they have to sell.Both the English, Dutch, and French tradeingto the Indians with it, above six hundred milesnorth and south from England; which is suffi¬cient to shew-, that the use of money is very an¬cient, and is made use of by all nations in trade¬ing with each other; and was first invented asa medium in trade, and an equivalent to all sortsof commodities.The Misery of those that want Money and arein Debt.There is no wise man that will covet moneyfor itself, but for the use that is to be made ofit; for money itself cannot satisfy; and so we aretold by the wisest of men, Eccles. v. 10. He thatjoveth silver shall not be satisfied with silver;nor he that loveth abundance with increase.”—■In a time of famine, or in a besieged city, a manmay have money enough by him, and yet maywant a piece of bread. Money therefore is prizednot for itself but for its use; because, as Solo¬mon also says, “ Money answers all things.’And seeing without money a man can have no¬thing, they must be very miserable that are with¬out it.Charity, in this last and iron age of the world,is grown so cold, that there is scarce any thingto be got upon that account. If you are cold,charity will not warm you; neither, if you arehungry will it fill your belly ; but if you havemoney, you may do both.If you have money, you may become one ofthe Livery-men of London, an Assistant, a War¬den, or a Master of a Company: but if you wantmoney, you will never arrive to the honour of abeadle; for even for such an inferior employmentyou must make friends, and that cannot be donewithout bribes, nor can you bribe without money.If vou have money, you may be an honest man,and a good man ; but if you want money, youmust be a knave by consequence.Enquire of a rich man among his neighbourswhat he is, meaning only whether he be a sub¬stantial man, and one that is responsible; and,they will presently tell you, “ he’s a very goodman I’ll assure youthough ot tims,0with respect to his morals, he is as profligate afellow as any in the whole parish, and one thatlives by oppressing his neighbours, and doing allmanner of injustice; bis money making amendsfor all his enormities.I knew a certain tradesman in London, thathad an uncle, a rich covetous fellow, that wasworth many a thousand ; this poor man addressedhimself to his uncle, to give him a £100 to sethim up ; but he knew the worth of money betterthan to part with it, before death forced it fromhim, and told him plainly, he would give him no¬thing while he lived, but it might be he wouldleave him something when he died, especially ifhe found him industrious, and that he put him¬self in a way to live. The poor man had but lit¬tle money, and less credit, and how to put him¬self in a way to live he knew not; his trade beingnone of the best for journeymen. However pick¬ing up a little credit at one place, and a little atanother, he addressed himself to the company hewas free of and would fain have borrowed £50of them; but truly they would not lend it him,but upon such security as he could not procure;in this extremity having put himself into a shop,he goes again to his uncle, to desire him to lendhim a little money, telling him he had set up intrade, and was got into a shop, but wanted mon-10ey to carry on his business, and desired him tolend him a little. His uncle finding he was get¬ting into a way, out of his generosity lends him£20 , but makes him give him a bond to pay himin a year’s time. The poor man had almost aswell been without his money, as to have been un¬der such an obligation; but he was resolved tokeep touch with him, though he lived so poorlyall the while that he was the scorn of all hisneighbours and fellow tradesmen, who looked up¬on him as a poor and consequently a pitiful follow:but for all that he paid his uncle the £20 withinthe time limited; which his uncle took so well,that he told him, since he took such care tokeep his word, he would remember him anothertime. And so he did; for having neither wifenor child, when he died, he divided his estate a-mongst his relations, and left this poor kinsmanof his, thirty thousand pounds in ready money,and £1500 per annum. And now this poor man,whose poverty made him the scorn of his neigh¬bours and acquaintances before, became a verygood man all on a sudden, insomuch that thecitv took notice of him, and chose him sheriff thevery next year; and the company that before re¬fused to lend him £50, now chose him theirmaster, and were all his humble servants; and hewas applauded and cried up by every one. Hero11was now a mighty change, and yet the man wasthe same still; it was money only made thedifference. Judge therefore whether want ofmoney be not an extraordinary misery, and agreat unhappiness.'i his puts me in mind of a story, I have heardrelated of Jocelin Percy, Esqr., brother to theEarl of Northumberland, who going by a but¬cher’s shop, near Cow-Cross affronted his dog,who thereupon fell a-barking at him, and theEsquire drew his sword and run him through.The butcher, who was troubled for the loss ofhis dog, charged a constable with the Esquire,who carried him before a Justice that knew himhot; the Justice asked him why he killed thebutcher’s dog ? The Esquire answered him verycarelessly, because the dog ran at him. Ran atyou! says Mr. Justice. How did he rup at you ?To which Percy ( being a comical sort of a man )replied. He ran at me thus, Bough 1 wmugh!wough! and therewith taking a little run at theJustice, threw him and his chair down together!Which Mr. Justice looked upon as such affrontto his worship, that nothing would atone for, butcommitting him to Newgate, aggravating the■ crime of killing the butcher’s dog, telling him,his dog was his servant, and that for ought heknew, himself cr some of hi? gang, designed to12mb bis ship; bat he would make an example ofhim. Percy seemed very little concerned atwhat the Justice said, which provoked him themore; and therefore he called the clerk to makehis mittimus, who asking him what his namewas, he said Jocelin. What besides Jocelin ?said the Clerk, Percy, said he. Of what place ?replied the Clerk. Of Northumberland-house,near to Charing-Cross, said he. The Justice |hearing this and knowing there was a very com-ical gentleman of that name, who was brother tothe Earl of Northumberland, then a great favour¬ite with his Majesty, changed his tone at once,and asked him if he was brother to the Earl ? Onbeing answered in the affirmative, he addressedhimself to the butcher in an angry tone, tellinghim that he would examine into the affair, andthat he \yould learn him better than let his dogloose to molest gentlemen as they walked thestreet, and that he would have him bound overto the peace at the Quarter-Sessions for his future jbehaviour. Which he would have done, and per- 1haps more, had not Percy interfered in his behalf.At this alteration the poor butcher was terrified, jThe Justice then addressed himself to the Es¬quire, and begged his pardon for using him insuch a manner, imputing it to his not knowinghi* quality. The Esquire, with a smile, repliedISthat he must also beg his pardon for throwinghim and his chair over. The Justice answered,there was no offence.Thus we may see the misery of wanting mon¬ey. The butcher could certainly have punishedPercy for killing his dog in such an unprovokedmanner, and would have obtained it, had not theJustice discovered Percy’s family, and let Jus¬tice wink rather than offend the brother of a fav¬ourite of his Majesty’s. The poor butcher mustnot only content himself with the loss of his dog,but be glad he escaped so well. It is just so,generally speaking, in every state of life; if aman be ever so virtuous and of the best princi¬ples, if he wants that principle, money, he wantsevery thing, and is looked upon as a mean piti¬ful fellow : on the contrary, if a man be possessedof that,*he has every thing, though otherwise o.the most consummate ignorance, debauched life,and insignificant conversation.I confess, if we look backward into the betterand wiser ages of the world, virtue, thoughcloathed in rags, was more esteemed than thetrappings of the gold ass; it is in these last andworst of days that vice has got such an ascen¬dant in the world, as to make men think all thatare poor are miserable; for in the primitivetimes, poverty was the badge of religion and14piety j and well it might, for not many great,nor many noble were called; and the study ofwisdom^ and contempt of the world was then inesteem among the wisest philosophers in theearliest ages. But as Ovid, saysThe times are chang’d, and even weSeem changed with times to be.So that in those times, considering the miseryof wanting money is so great, we may say withthe wise man, “ My son, it is better to die thanto be poor which saying was perhaps the oc¬casion of an old miser’s mistake, who bid his sonobserve what Solomon said, “ Always keep apenny in your pocket.” But his son answeredagain, he did not remember that Solomon saidany such thing. The miser replied, then Solo¬mon was not so wise as I took him to be.Indeed money’s now become the worldly man’sgod, and the card which the devil turns uptrumph to win the game; for it gives birth,breeding, beauty, honour, and credit; and makesthe possessors think themselves wise, thoughtheir very thinking'so, declaies them fools. Butbecause money answers all things, and is in suchvogue with the world, therefore many are sowilling to purchase it though with the loss ofsoul and body.But the want of money does not only cause/15men to be condemned and ridiculed, but it alsoputs men upon taking wicked and unlawfulcourses to obtain it: which made one say.O wretched poverty! a tool thou’rt made,- To every evil act and wicked trade.For it wresteth and maketh crooked the best na¬tures ; which are forced by their necessities, todo those things which they blush to think ofwhile they are doing them ; such as borrowing,and not being able to pay, to speak untruths tocover and disguise their poverty; to deceive andsometimes to cheat their nearest relations; andall because, when they are in want, they areScorned, and despised, and perhaps disowned bythem., But before I leave this subject, of shewing themisery of wanting money, it is necessary I shouldsay something of the misery of borrowing money,or running in debt, which is a consequent ofwanting money ; for he that does not want, hasno occasion to borrow, and is in that respecthappy; for being out of debt he is out of danger,and therefore needs not seek for by-ways to avoidhis creditors, but can walk in the open streetswithout fear, and whet his knife even at the gatesof the prison.But on the contrary, he that borrows money,has made himself such a slave to his creditors,16that he dare# hardly say his head is his own, andis afraid that every one he meet is a serjeant ora bailiff, that intends to captivate his outwardtabernacle; like the man that in the night-time,having his coat catched by a nail, and so stop¬ped, he presently cried out, “ At whose suit ?Supposing it was a seijeant that had arrested him.The causes of Men wanting Money.Since money is a thing so necessary and souseful, and the want of a competency of it, makesa man so very miseiable, rendering him liable toall the scorn and contempt that an ill-naturedworld can throw upon him; it seems strange somany should want it, especially those that knowthe worth of it. And therefore it may be worthour enquiring into the causes from whence thiswant proceeds: I mean the common and ordin¬ary causes; for there are some causes that areextraordinary, such as all our wit and prudencecan neither foresee nor avoid. Such was thatextraordinary and surprising storm in November1703, whereby many thousands were undone, asto their estates, besides the many lives that werelost; and such also was the dreadful fire in Lon-17jlon, whereby some that had great estates theone week, had scarce bread to eat the next: andin the time of war many are unavoidably losers.But these must not be reckoned the commonand ordinary ways that make and keep men poor.We know indeed, that by the divine providence,in the body of a common-wealth there must beboth poor and rich, even as an human body can¬not subsist without hands and feet to labour, andwalk about to provide for the other members; soj the rich being the belly, which devour all, yet doj no part of the work; but the cause of every man’spoverty is not one and the same; some are poorby condition and content with their calling, andj neither seek nor can work themselves into bettercondition; yet God raised up, as by a miracle,i the children and posterity of these, oftentimes,to possess the most eminent places either inchurch or common-wealth, as to become Arch-bishops, Bishops, Judges, Commanders-generalin the field, Secretaries of State, Statesmen, andtthe like; so that it proveth not always true whichthe poet says,If poor thou art, then poor thou shalt remain;Rich men alone do now rich gifts obtainOf this condition are the greatest number in everykingdom; others there are, who have possessed! great estates, but these estates have not thrivenISor continued, being gotten by oppression, deceit,usury, and the like, which commonly lasteth notto the third generation, according to the poet,It seldom is the grandchild’s lot,To be the heir of goods not justly got.Others come to want and misery, by spendingtheir fair estates in ways of vicious living, as ondrink and women; for Bacchus and Venus are in-seperable companions; and he that is familiarwith the one, is never a stranger to the other.In same way, manner, and end,Both wine and women do offend.Some again live in perpetual want, being natu¬rally wholly given to idleness. These are thedrones of a common-wealth, who deserve not tolive. “ lie that laboureth not, should not eat.;Labour night and day, rather than be burthen-!some,” saith the Apostle Paul: both country and^city swarm with this kind of people; “ The dilWjgent hand,” saith Solomon, “ shall make rich;but the sluggard shall have a scarcity of bread.”I remember when I was in the Low Countries,there were three soldiers, a Dutch-man, a Seotj >and an Englishman, who, for their misdemeanors,!were condemned to be hanged; yet their liveswere begged by three several men, one a brick-,layer, that he might help him to make bricks, andcarry them to the walls; the other was a brewer.9of Delft, who begged Ids man to fetch water, anddo other work in the brew-house! and the thirdby a gardener, to help him to work in and dressa hop garden. The first two accepted their offersthankfully; but the last, the Englishman, toldhismaster in plain terms, his friends had never broughthim up to gather hops : and therefore desired rath¬er to be hanged.Others have had great estates left unto themby their friends, and who never knew the painand care of getting them, have as one said truly,galloped through them in a very short time;these are such as Solomon speaketh of “ who hav¬ing riches have no hearts, or rather the wit, touse them.” These men are most aptly comparedto the willow-tree, because the palms of the wil¬low-tree are no sooner ripe, but blown away withthe wind.I remember to have heard of a wealthy citizenof London, in Queen Elizabeth’s time, who lefthis son a great sum of money, who imagined heshoulff never be able to spend it; would usuallymake ducks and drakes in the Thames with shil¬lings, as boys were wont to do with tile sheardsand oyster shells; and at the end came to suchextreme want, that he was under the necessityof borrowing sixpence, having many times moreshoes than feet, and sometimes more feet thanshoes, as the beggar said in the comedy.Many also there are, who having heen born toa good estate, have quite undone themselves bymarriage, and that after a twofold manner; first,by matching themselves without advice of parentsor friends, in heat of youth, unto proud, foolish,and light women, that one would better live onsmall allowance at a distance, than have a fullmeal at home, where he is always troubled withher never ceasing tongue. And this is the reasonso many husbands travel beyond seas; or at homego from town to town, or from tavern to tavern,to look for company ! and in a word, to spend anything, to live any where, save at home, in theirown houses, where they are sure to hear nothingbut the brawlings of a scolding woman.DIRECTIONSHow persons may supply themselves with Moneyat all times.NOW, if you would ask me what course youshould take, or what you should do that wantethmoney ; let him first bethink himself to what pro¬fession or trade he hath been formerly broughtup to. If of the inferior or middle sort of trades21men or artificers, (for those are chiefly concernedin this unhappiness) let such.First, be very diligent and industrious in theirrepective trades and callings, and not be slothfulin business.Secondly, Let him take heed of idleness, andall vain and idle companions, that loiter up anddown, and squander away their time as if it wereof no value, though it is the most precious thing|ftn the world, there being nothing in the worldijthat is a more certain indication of ruin and de-tjs tract ion, than the wasting and misimproving ofour time. And yet this is done by those thatwould take it ill to be charged therewith: as fornstance, how many are there that spend a greatleal of their time in Coffee-houses and Weekly-Clubs ! where, tho’ but little money is pretended;o be spent, yet a great deal of precious time issquandered away and lost! which many that fre-juent these places never think of, but measureheir expenses only by what goes out of their! jockets, not considering what they might havegained in the time by their labour, and what theynight have saved by keeping at their shops.Let us therefore reckon, when a tradesman[•oes to the Coffee-house or Ale-house to take aaorning draught, (let it be of what liquor hevilla,) while he is spending his twopence, amok-22ing and talking, he losses at least an hour of hMtime; and in the evening he goes to his two-pen-lny club, and there tarries from six till ten!Now, it must be a very poor trade, if in thattime he could not have earned a shilling. Ancif he keeps servants, the want of his presence alhome may have occasioned his losing as much ashe could have gained himself; so that his spend¬ing a groat morning and night, (which is two¬pence each time) cannot be accounted less thaiithe loss of 2s 8d a-day, which comes to 14s a-week, and £36 : 1 Os a-year, which sum if saved;until his eldest son arrived at 21 years of age;and so fit for marriage, and to set up in trade,would have amounted to £750 ; 10s. They whcwould live so as not to want money, must avoieall such idle and needless expenses, and unnece^sary loss of time.But if the person complaining of the want omoney, has been brought up to no trade, then lehim consider to what kind of life his genius o:natural disposition does most of all incline himIf he cannot find employment in his own country to suit his genius, (which can scarcely he supposed in a country such as Great Britain, whenarts and science are carried to the greatest perfection, and where a person of any genius, or alittle genius, may find employment) let him seel23{ his fortune abroad. Ha may at once satisfy his■curiosity, supply his necessity, and serve hiscountry, by going into the army or navy, andthereby have an opportunity of doing brave ac¬tions in the service of his country abroad, andthere he may come to advantage both his fortuneI and family -If he inclines not the employment; of the army or navy, he may find something tosuit him in our Plantations in the East and West, Indies or in America, in all which places manya man hath done well, who could do nothing ati home. Thus you shall find great contentmentI to your conscience to be in action, which Godi commands us all to be.j The times in no age was so hard as to deny' industry and ingenuity a livelihood: and, in ai word, rather to be in misery for want of money,1st a man undertake any vocation and labour, andNever think the labour coarseThat puts a penny in the purse.( The want of money is a great torment, and^ often puts men on unlawful shifts to procure it;therefore let every one who has got money, becareful to know its worth: for since we are bornwe must live, and it is hard to live upon a smallshare of it. And to conclude this chapter, let usbe always careful to get, and cautious in spend¬ing money ; and when you have it, know how tok?ep and how to use it, when there is occasion;for money in your pocket is the best companion.As one observed, “ be a good husband, and thouwilt soon get a penny to spend, a penny to lend,and a penny for thy friend.” For I would havenone to be such misers as to gain money only tokeep, and not make use of it; for to such, moneyis the greatest curse, of which the world has been•irnished with many instances.Gain a penny, spend a penny,(Says the frugal man;)But if you spend before you gairvYou’ll ne’er be merry then.

If the Life Line runsfair and uninterrupted, the person will enjoy goodhealth j and according to its length towards the11outside of the fore finger, you may judge if theperson will live long, as the longer the Line thelonger the Life.If the Line of Death is short, and runs even,without being broken or divided, it she^vs that theperson will enjoy a good length of days, and not besubject to many maladies; but if it is infe7rupted,it evidently shews that the person’s life will be en¬dangered by illness, but by the care of Providencewill recover.Wieen the Table Line is broad, strong, and wellmarked, it shews the person to be of a sound con¬stitution, and a peaceable contented mind : if it isbroken, it shews for every break a violent interrup*tion to happiness ; if these breaks happen towardsthe part next the wrist, he will be crossed in love,and either be disappointed in the person he has fixedhis affections on, or be saddled with a person of adisobliging temper, and a most audacious and abu¬sive tongue.The Girdle of Venus, when it goes on fair andwell marked, shews that the person will be prosper¬ous in love, fair in his dealings with the fair sex,and be smcerely-belove'd ; he will obtain a partnerfor life of a fortune equal to b's own, sweet temper¬ed, faithful, and affectionate; but if it is interrupted■ at its beginning near the little finger, he will meetwith early disappointments in .love ; if towards themiddle of the line, he will rum his health, and in¬jure his fortune with lewd prostitutes ; if near theend, he will be foolishly amorous in his old age,still expecting to gain the heart of a woman, butnever will obtain it.The Line of Fortune, by its approach to tireGirdle of Venus, shews that there is a strong kin¬dred between them, and their distance at their twoextremities clearly point out that love is inconsistentwith childhood, and old age; yet in those wherethe cross line approach from the one to the other12near the ends, prove that the persons were, or will?be susceptible of love in childhood,'or old age.If the hollow palm of the har,d: which some callthe flam of Mars, is full of cross lines running into'each other, the person will be of a humorsome, un¬even, and testy temper, jealous and hasty, quarrel¬some and fighting, and endeavouring to set othersby the ears; he will meet with very frequent, mis¬fortunes, and bear them very uneasily ; whereas, ifthe hollow or palm of the hand has none but theunavoidable lines, that is to say, those tha* mustunavoidably pass through it, L? wdi be of a sweetand amiable disposition, full of sensibility, grathude,and love, faithful, benevolent, and kind ; and thoughsubject to losses, crosses, and disappointments, willhear them with an even and agreeable temper; fromthis part chiefly, it is recommended to persons tochuse their companions for life, either for friendshipor marriage.The mount or ball of the thumb, bears a parti¬cular analogy to the events of a person’s life, with irespect to disputes, quarrels and lawsuits; if thismount has many long strait lines reaching fromthe thumb to the Line of Life, they show that theperson will have several personal encounters; eitherwith hands, clubs, pistols ©r swords; but if the linesate curved and crooked, they will indicate lawsuits,and according to the degree of crookedness, theywill be long or short but if tnese lines end ia astraight direction towards the line of life, they will^nd*prosperously, whether encounter or lawt.suits ^if otherwise, they will be attended with an un¬favourable issue; the nearer to the line of life theselines begin, the later in a person’s life the quarrelsor latv-suits will take place; and the nearer to rbeline of life they end, the later in life they will ter¬minate.ISTO TELL FORTUNES BY THE GROUNDSOF A.

If the ring appears atIhe bottom of the cup, it forebodes an eatire sepa¬ration from the beloved object.Tlx Leaf of Clover,Is as well here as in common life, a lucky sign,ts different po<.iuon in the cup alone makes the dif-!#rence; because if it is on the top, it shews thatI14the good fortune is not far distant; but it is subjeceto delay, if it is in the middle, or at the bottom!Should clouds surround it, it shews that many di.siagreeable* will attend the good fortune; in thilclear., prognostiontes serene and undisturbed happ ;ness, as bright as the party wishes.The Anchor>The emblem of hope and commerce, implies sucicessful business carried on by water and by land, ijon the bottom of the cup ; at the top, and in thiclear part, it shews constant love, and an unshakenfidelity.

On th !top, or in the middle of the cup, it promises to th<consulting party the triumph which he desires ovejhis enemjj: but he will not obtain it so easily if th«serpent be in the thick or cloudy thick. By theletter which frequently appears near the emblemsthe enemy may easily be guessed, it makes the ini-itial of hts name.The Letter.By letters, we communicate to our friends either!pleasant or unpleasant news, and such is the casehere : if this emblem is in the clear part it denotesthe speedy arrival of welcome news; surrounded;with dots, it announces the arrival of a considerableteinittance in money; but heriimed in by cloudsit is quite the contrary, and forebodes some melan¬choly or bad tidings, a loss, or some other sinisteraccident,The CoJJin,The emblem of death, prognosticates the samething here. or. at least a long and tedious illness,if it be in the thick or turbid.^ In the clear, it de¬notes long life.

Several starslenote so many good and happy children ; but sur-■ounded with dashes, shews that your children will:ause you grief and vexation in your old age, and:hat you ought to prevent it by giving them a goodsducation in time.The Dog,Being at all times the emblem of fidelity or envy,:as also a two-fold meaning here. At the top, inthe clear, it signifies true and faithful friends; butif his image be surrounded with clouds or dashes,it shews that those whom you take for your friendsare n*»t to be depended on ; but if the dog be at thebottom of the cuo, you have to dread the effects ofextreme envy or jealousv.The Lily.* If this emblem be at the top, or in the middle ofthe cup, it signifies that the consulting party eitherIras or will have a virtuous spouse; if it be at thebottom, it denotes quite the reverse. In the clear,ithe lily further betokens long and happy life; ifIclouded, or in the thick, it portends trouble andivexation, especially on the part of one’s relation.The Cross,Be it one or more, it generally predicts adversities,ills position varies, and so do the circumstances. Ifit be at the top, and in the clear, it shews that the[misfortunes of the party will soon be at an end, or;that he will easily get over them $ but if it appearsi in the middle, or at the bottom in the thick-, the16pirty must expect many severe trials: if it apear with dots, either in the clear or in flie thic iit promises a speedy change of one’s sorrow., The Clouds.Tf they be more light than dark, yon may erpeiba good result from your hopes; but if they a:black, you may give it up. Surrounded with dotthey imply success in trade, and' in all your undetakings ; but the brighter they are, the greater wibe your happiness.The Sun,An emblem of the greatest luck and happinestif in toe clear; but in the thick it bodes a grerdeal of sadness; snrrounded by dots or dashes d«notes that an alteration will easily take place.The Moon.If it appears in the clear, it denotes high honours!ia the dark, or thick part, it implies sadness, whicwill, however, pass without great prejudice. Buif it be at the bottom of the cup, tlje consulcinjparty will be very fortunate both by water and laneMountain.If it represents only one mountain, it indicatethe favour of people of high rank, but several rthem, especially in the thick, are signs of powerfcenenues; in the clear, they signify the contrary, Cfriends in high life, who are endeavouring to premote the consulting party.The Tree.One tree only, be it in the clear or thick partpoints out lasting good health ; several trees denotthat your wish will be accomplished.The Child.In the clear part, it bespeaks innocent intercoursbetween the coasultor and another,person; ia ththick part, excesses in love matters, attended witgreat espences: at the bottom of the cup it denotethe consequences ci" lubidinous amours, and a ve:destructive end.17[j The true rr,tlhod of telling yr.ur Fcitur.e, byCARDS.I TAKE a Pbck of Cards, and pick Six out ofkch sort, viz. the 8, 9, 10, Knave, King & Queen,ese being the most Prophetic Cards in the Pack,et the Person whose Fortune is to be learned beir.dfolded.

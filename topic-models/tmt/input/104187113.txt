IN ME.0, when I was a younker,A maid would marry me,And often-times I drunk her,In toasts of three times three.6She said, were I extravagant,She never could agree ;Do you take me for a vagabond ?You’ll find no change in me.You’ll find no change in me.So quickly we got married.As many mad folks do ;And the priest swore we were only one,Though I swore we were two.He talk’d about living happily,And then he ask’d his fee ;Kind man, said I, be not absurd.You’ll find no change in me ;You’ll find no change in me.A month had scarcely wander’d pgst,When my poor Sue did die.And no one ever wept so fast,Or sadly as did I.The Undertaker did the rest,With him I did agree ;And he and all have" since confess’d,They found no change in me ;They found no change in me.THE CHARMING WIDOW.I’m a charming widow now.In age just twenty-two.And being rid of my former vow,New lovers come here to woo.'7There’s many a one with flattering tongue.Of high and of low degree ;But he that is both merry and youngIs the brisk young man for me.There’s, &c.Last time I wed a husband old,About fourscore or more ;But then his purse was lin’d with gold.Which woman-kind adore.He’s dead and gone to his narrow home,So then let him quiet be ;And now my heart is free to roam,So a brisk young man for me.There’s, &c.I’VE DREAMT THAT THOU ART FADING.I’ve dreamt that thou art fading.If thou’rt fading, love, for me—0 resume thy early beauty,For I am not false to thee.The feelings that pervade thee.May have touch’d this heart as sore ;Yet thy charms have ever bade meBehold thee, and adore.I’ve mov’d among the manyWho were beautiful and gay,And since last mine eyes beheld thee,I have wander’d far away.8Yet among each jojous circle,O my heart return’d to thee All was cheerless, all was sunless,For thou went not there with me.LOVE, AND OUR OCEAN HOME.Our home is amid the sea,Where the billows roll proudly and dark :Our course and our thoughts are free, are freeAs the breezes that waft our bark ;And while, with the best of the brave.On our pathless domain we roam.The song that swells far on the wave.Is “ Love, and our ocean home.” ‘'Tis night in our sea-girt isle.And gaily the goblet goes round.But soon merry morn shall smile, shall smile,And away to battle we bound.And when from the deeds of our fameWe dance o’er the crested foam,Our fondest song, and our proudest theme,Is “ Love, and our ocean home.’’

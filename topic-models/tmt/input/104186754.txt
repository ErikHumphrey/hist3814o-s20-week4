Young Lochinvar,To which are added,The Rose of Dunmore,Scottish Whisky,Blythe was She but and ben,Sleepin Maggy,Shepherds, I have lost my lore*STIRLING :Printed Jor the Booksellers,.O! Young Lochip.var has come out of the west,Through all the wide border his steed was the best;And save his good broad sword, he weapons had none,He rode all unarm’d, and he rode all alone.So faithful in love, and so dauntless in war,There never was knight like the young Lochinvar.He staid not for brake, and he stopp’d not for stone.He swam the Eske river where ford there was none;But, ere he alighted at Netherby gate,The bride had eoncented, the gallant came late ;For a laggard in love, and a dastard in war,Was to wed the fair Helen of brave Lochinvar.So boldly he enter’d the Netherby Hall,Among bridesmen, and kinsmen, and brothers and all;Then spake the bride’s father, his hand on his sword,(For the poor craven, bridegroom said never a word,)“ O come ye in peace here, or come ye in war.Or to dance at our bridal, young lord Lochinvar?”“ I long njoo'd your danghfer, my spit you denied j—>Love swells like the Solway, but ebbs at its title-—Aad now I am come with this lost love of mine,To lead but one measure drink one cup of wine.There are maidens in Scotland more lovely by far—That Would gladly be bride to the young Lctbinvar.’’3The bride kiss’d the gobiel; the knight took it up,He quaff d off the wine, nod he threw down the cup.She look'd down to blush, and she look d up to eigb,With » smile on her lips, and a tear in her eye.He took her soft band, e er her mother could bar,“ Now tread we a measure!” said young Locbinvar.So stalely his form, and so lovely her face,That never a hall such a galiiard did grace ;While her mother did fret, and her father did fume,And the bridegroom stood dangling his bonnet andplume;And thefbride»raaidens whisper'd ’twere better by farTo have match’d our fair cousin with young Lochinvar.One touch to her hand, and one word in h^r ear,When they .reach d the hall-door, and the charger stoodnear;I She is won ! vve are gone, over bank, bush, and scaur ;They’ll have fleetsteeds that follow, quoth youngLocb-invar,3 There was mounting ’mong Orames of the Nether'yclan ;I Forsters, Fenwicks, and Mnsgraves, they rode andthey ran ;t There was I’acing and chacing, on Csrmobie ieejBut the lost bride of Netherby ne’er r.id they see.So daring in love, aud so dauntless in war,Have ye e'er heard ef gallant like young Lochinva/.4-THfe ROSE OF f)UNMORE.As I went a walking out early.Bright Phebus most sweetly did shine,And the nightingale warbled melodious.As the lusin that falls from the glen.It’s down thro’ a grove where I walked,A while to condole in a shade,On my destiny for to ponder,It’s there I beheld a sweet maid.I cast forth my eyes for to view her,And thus unto her I did say,You fair has my heart ensnared.How far thro* the grove dost thou stray ?She answered, sir, I will tell you,The truth unto you 1'lf explore,Of a matter that lately befell me,My dwelling lies near Duamore.Once I did lote a brave hero,Till my tender heart he did gain,No mortal I ever lov'd dearer,But now he is ploughing the main,All under brave Neilson for battle,And our English Navy so brave,Where cannons and guns loudly rattle,Against the proud French on the main.He says, now my fair, so ensnaring,Perhaps j-jur true-love he is slain,As many a man fell a victim,And fell by the French on the main ;So it might happen with your love,As it hath done with many before,5I pray come with me to Rathfriland,And bid a farewell to Dunmore,How could I he thus so inconstant,And promised so much to he true.To leave my old sweetheart lamenting.And venture all fortune with you ;The peopje would call me hard hearted,For fidelity to him I’ve swore,That our loves should never be parted,But wait for the youth in Dunmore.Since it is so now decreed,That I now a victim must fall,I cannot refrain bow but mourn,Tho I am no better at all.I still live .n expectation,Of that charming youth I adore,I hope to my great consolation,To meet him with joy in Dunmore.Cheeks like the fair beauties blown,Your summer will s*.on be o'er,October winds will be blown,And blast the sweet rose of Dunmoie.I found thut her heart was failing,As many had done before,I hoist up my sails for Ratbfriland,And gained tire sweet rose of Dunmore. «SCOTTISH

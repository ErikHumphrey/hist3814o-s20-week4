O, we were sly and sleekit!But ne’er say a herring is dry until it be reestit andsmeekit.YVe treated young Mr M-Gock,We plied him wi’ tea and wi’ toddy ;And we praised every word that he spoke,! Till we put him maist out o’ the body.O, we were sly, sly! &c.Frae the kirk we were never awa’.Except when frae hame he was helpingAnd then May, and often us a’,Gaed far and near after him skelping.0, we were sly, sly! &c.I YVe said aye, which our neighbours thought droll,That to hear him gang through wi’ a sermon,Was, (though a wee dry on the whole,)As refreshing’s the dew on Mount Hermon.O, we were sly, sly! &c.!But to come to the heart o’ the nit—The dainty bit plan that we plotted'Was to get a subscription afit.And a watch to the minister voted.0, we were sly, sly! &c.!The young women folk o’ the kirk,By turns lent a hand in collecting ;But May took the feck o’ the wark.And the trouble the rest o’ directing.O, we were sly, sly! &c.! A gran’ watch was gotten bely ve,And May wi’ sma’ prigging, consentit! To be ane o’ a party o’ fiveTo gang to the Manse and present it.i 0, we were sly, sly! &c.0We a’ gied a word o’ adviceTo May in a deep consultation,To Lae something to say unca nice,And to speak for the hale deputation.0, we were sly, sly! &c.Taking present and speech baith in hand,May delivered a bonny palaverTo let Mr M'Gock understandHow zealous she was in his favour.0, we were sly, sly! &c.She said that the gift was to prove.That his female friends valued him highly,But it couldna express a’ their love ;And she glintit her e’e at him slyly.0, we were sly, sly ! &c.He put the gold watch in his fab,And proudly he said he wad wear it;And, after some flattering gab,Tauld May he was gaun to be marryit.0, we were sly, sly! 0, were sly and slcekit!But Mr M'Gock was nao gowk, wi’ our dainty bit pie-to be cloekit.May came hame wi’ her heart at her mouth.And became, frae that hour, a Dissenter,And now she’s renewing her youthWi’ some hopes o’ the burgher Precentor.0, but she’s sly, sly! O, but she’s sly and sleekit!And cleverly opens ae door as soon as anither is steeki7THE BACHELOR.My master was an auld Batch,Baith crabbed and uncivil:Than kiss a lass, (except when fou’)He'd sooner kiss the d 1.An’ he had gowd and sil’er baith,As meikle’s fill a barrel;A gaudy house, an’ grand estate,Might serve a duke or earl.But woman’s ways he coudua thole—The cause o’ a disasters ;He’d sneer, an’ jeer, an’ curse the sexAnd ca’ them downright wasters.But then, again, when he was fu’.His love was overbearing ;He’d kiss an’ slake about my mou’,Nae wife nor sil’er fearing.As I was growing auld mysel’,And lovers growing scanty,I thought upon my master’s house,His gear an’ sil’er plenty.ISo I got witnesses ae night,When he was reeling rarely,To hear his tender promises.An’ see us bedded fairly.He sought me to his chamber ha’,And troth, I didna swither ;But gave a sweet complying smile,An’ aff to bed thegither.But oh! that morn when he awoke !Ere he could weel consider,8He drew his arms frae ’bout my neck,As if he’d touch’d an adder!“ Weel, Bet!” says he, what brings you hereMy troth, but you re a trimmer!Gae, rise, an’ mend the kitchen fire.You lewd lascivious limmer !”“ Na, na, gudeman! do that yourscl’—I’ll rise when I am ready;I was your servant yesterday,But now I am your lady!”But wha could paint his waspish face,As I the facts were telling!His miser-moans, his sil’er-shrieks,Were like a cuddy’s yelling!Wi’ rage, he fell upon the floor,And gi’ed a roar like thun’er ;But matrimony’s chains are strong—There’s few they’ll not keep un’er.Now since his single woes are past,■ An’ he has got a baby,His looks hae quite anither cast,His dress is never shabby.An’ aye he blesses Bet his wife,The night she nail’d him till her,An’ wadna be a Batch againFor a' his lan’ an’ sil’er.

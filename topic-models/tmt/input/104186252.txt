I have three chiictren to feed,Which is not enough to find them in bread.She up with the piss-pot and threw’t at his head,Saying, O that 1 ne’er had been married.She sat herse’f down for to rest her a while.And thus she began :o prattle,A lecmre she gave him again I declare.Which made his poor head for to rattle.Begone to your whores, 1 solemnly swear,It you stay any longer I’ll cut off your e-trs,And I’ll certamiv spoil all the rest of your wares.Saying, O that 1 ne'er had been.manied.7You impudent jade to rail against whores,Pray where is your gallant the taylor ?By him you had a bastard you know,The mean-time that I was a sailorYou rifled my riches, you plunder’d my store,I father’d your bastard when I came on shore.You audacious jade, to rail against whores,Saying, O that 1 ne’er had been married.The reason of this the woman did say,All reason that 1 had this failing,He only supplied your place when away,The mean-time when you was a*saiiing.For seven long years that you was from home,. Why should I ly sighing and tumbling alone,While you got a Moll in each port you did come,Saying, O that I ne’er had been married.Before that you rogue, you disgraced me so,I passed for an honest woman *,But now you have let the neighbours to know,That 1 to the 1’aylor was common.For disgracing me so, you’re the son of a whore,She off with her cap, and at him once more,Then presently they did roll on the floor,Saying, O that I ne’er had been married.The children did squall, the dishes did fly,The pipkins did rattle like thunder,By this time the neighbours broke open the door,And strove for to part them asunder;But she like a scold did make this reply,Go hang you, you rogue. I’ll fight till I die.Site up with her hand and gave him a black eye,Saying, Blast you; you rogue, I’ll he master.8THE WANDERING SAILOR.THE vc-anci'ring sailor ploughs the main,A competence in life to gain,Undaunted braves the stormy seas,. To lird, at least, content and ease ;In hopes, when toil and danger’s o’er,To anchor on his native shore.n.When winds blow h^rd, and mountains roll,And thunders shake from pole to pole;Tho’ oreadful waves surrounding foam,Still flatt’ring fancy wafts him home;In hopes, when toil and danger’s o’er.To anchor on his native shore.III.When round the bowl the jovial crewThe early scenes of youth renew,Tho’ each his fav’rice fair will boast,This is the universal toast—May we, when toil and danger’s o’er,Cast anchor on our native shore.FINIS

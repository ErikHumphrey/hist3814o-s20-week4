bennison,Only by fraud thy father frae;Gave thou not him for venison,11A kid, instead of baked rae,Jacob himself was tickled so,He went to Lot where he was lying,And to the gate he pray’d him to go,I To staunch the carling of her crying.Lot says fair dame, make less ado,And come again another day.Old harlot carle and drunkard too,Thou with thine own two daughters lay,i Of thine untimely seed I say,j Proceeded never good but ill.Poor Lot, for shame then stole away,). And left the wife to knock her fill.Meek Moses then went down at last,| To pacify the carling then;I Now, dame, said he, knock not so fast,I', Your knocking will nor let you ben.Good Sir, said she I

remember,Who made the people plagues to see,This is of you recorded ever;Your priesthood now is nothing worth,Christ is my only priest and he,My Lord who will not keep me forth, -So I’ll get in, in spite of theeUp started Samson at the length,Unto the gate apace came he,To drive away the wife with’s strength.But all in vain it would not be.Samson, says she, the world mav see,Thou wast a Judge who proved unjust,Those gracious gifts which God gave thee,Thou lost them by licentious lust.From Dalila thy wicked wife,The secrets chief couldst nor refrain,She daily sought to take thy life,Thou lost thy locks and then was slain,Tho’ thou wast strong it was in vain,Flaunting with harlots here and there.'Then Sams back again.13i\nd with the wife would mell nae mair.Then said king' David, knock no more.A c are all troubled with your cry.David, quoth she, how cain’st thou there,riiou might’st hide out as well as 1 :Thy deeds no ways thou can’st deny,jls not thy sin far worse than mine,(Who with Uriah’s wife did lie,Ami caused him to he murdered syne?Then Jonas said, fair dame content you,If you intend to come to grace,You must dree pennance and repent you,•Ere you can come within this place.Jonas, quoth she, how stands the case?fHow came you here to he with Christ ?i How dare you look him in the lace ?''Considering how you broke your tryst?So Jonas then he was ashamed,Because he was not flyting free,Of all his faults she had him blamed,He left the wife and let her he.Saint Thomas then, I counsel theeGo speak unto yon wicked wife,She shames us all and as for me,Her like I never heard in lifeThomas, then said, you make such strife.When you are out, and meikle din,If ye were here 1 11 lay my life,14No peace the saints will get within,It is your trade for to be flyting,Still in a fever as one raves,No marvel though you wives be biting,Your tongues are made of aspen leaves.Thomas, quoth she, let be your taunts,You play the pick-thank I perceive,Tho’ you be brother’d ’mong the saints,An unbelieving heart you haveThou brought’st the Lord unto the grave,But would’st no more with him remain,And wast the last of all the laveThat did believe he rose again.There might no doctrine do thee good,No miracles make thee confide,Till thou beheld Christ’s wounds and blood.And putt’st thy hands into his side;Didst thou not daily with him bide,And see the wonders which he wrought?But blest are they who do confide,And do believe, yet saw him not;Thomas, she says, will ye but spcer,If that my sister Magdelene,Will come to me, if she be here ;For comforts sure you give me nane.lie was so blythe and turned back,And thanked God that she was gane;He had no will to hear her crack,15But told it Mary Magdalene.When that she heard her sister’s monks,She went unto the gate with speed :And asked her who’s there that knocks ;'Tis I the wife of Beith indeed.She said, good mistress, you must standTill you be tried by tribulation.Sister, quoth she, give me your handAre we not both of one vocation ;It is not through your occupation,That you are placed so divine,My faith is fixed on Christ’s passion,My soul shall be as safe as thine.Then Mary went away in haste,The carling made her so ashamed,She had no will of such a guest,To lose her pains and be so blamed.Now good Saint Paul, said Magdalene,For that you are a learned man,Go and convince this woman then,For I have done all that I can;Sure if she were in hell, I doubtThey would not keep her long there.But to the gate would put her out,And send her back to be elsewhere.Then went the good apostle Paul,To put the wife in better tune,Wash off that filth that files thy soul.10Then shall henven’s gates he opened soon.liememher, Paul, what thou hast done,For all the epistles thou didst compile,Though now thou sittest up above,Thou persecuted’st Christ a while.Woman, he said, thou art not right,That which 1 did, I did not know;But thou didst sin with all thy might,Although the preachers did thee showSaint Paul, she said, it is not so1 did not know so well as ye,But I will to my Saviour go,Who will his favour shew to meYou think you are of flyting free,Because you was rapt up above,But yet. it was Christ’s grace to thee.And matchlessness of his dear love.Then Paul, says she, let Peter come,If he be lying let biin rise,l o him I will confess my sin,And let him quickly bring the keys,Too long I stand, he’ll let me in,For why I cannot longer tarry,Then shall ye all be quit of din,For I must speak with good saint Mary,Peter, said she, let Christ arise,And grant me mercy in my need ;For why 1 ne’er deny'd him thrice,s thou tli vst'lf hast done indeedThou carling1 hold, what’s that to thee?got remission tor my sin ;t cost many sad tears to me,efore I entered here within.It will not be thy meiklc dinjWill cause heaven’s gates opened be,Ifl'hou must be purified of sin,nd of all sins must be made free.Saint Peter then, no thanks to you,'hat so you were rid of your fears,It was Christ’s gracious look, 1 trow,That made you weep those bitter tears.1 he door of mercy is not closed,I may get grace as well as ye,It is not so as ye supposed,1 will be in in spite of thee.But wicked wife, it is too late,Thou should’st have mourn’d on earth,|S Hepentancc now is out of date :lit should have been before thy death,Thou mightest then have turned wrathTo mercy then, and mercy great,But now the Lord is very loth,And all thy cries not worth a jot.Ah! Peter, then, what shall I do ?lit- will not hear me as I hear,Shall 1 despair of mercy too?10No, no, I’ll trust in mercy dear ;And if I perish, here I’ll stayAnd never go from heaven brightI’ll ever hop and always pray,Until I get my Saviour’s sight.I think indeed you are not right,if you had faith you could win in ;Importune "then with all your might.Faith is the feet wherewith ye come •It is the hands will hold him fast,But weak faith may not presume ;’Twill let you sink, and be aghastStrongly believe, or you’re undoneBut, good saint Peter, let me be,Had you such faith, did it abound ?When you did walk upon the sea,Was you not like for to be drown’d,Had not our Saviour helped thee,Who came and took thee by the hand.So can my Lord do unto me,And bring me to the promised land.Is my faith weak? yet he is stillThe same and ever shall remain ;His mercies last, and his good will,To bring me to his flock again;He will me help and me relieve,And will increase my faith also,Of weakly I can but believe,19r from this place I’ll never go'But Peter said, how can that be,Iiw durst thou look him in the face,ch horrid sinners like to thee,in have no courage to get grace;re none comes in but they that’s stout,d suffered have for the good cause ;.te unto thee are keeped out,r thou hast broke all Moses’ laws.Peter, she said, I do appeal,)m Moses, and from thee also,th him and you I’ll not prevail,it to my Saviour I will go;eed of old you were right stout;xen yon did cut off Malehus’ ear;t after that you went about;d a poor maid then did you fear,tierefore, saint Peter, do forbear,comforter indeed you’re not ,*t me alone, I do not fear,ke home the whistle of your groat:,s it your own, or Paul’s good sword,en that your courage was so keen,m were right stout upon my word,ren would you fain at fishing been;r at the crowing of the cock,du did deny your master thrice,r all your stoutness turned a block,Yet at the last the Lord arose.Environed with angels bright,And to the wife in haste he goes,Desired her soon pass out of sight.Now flyte no more if ye be wise.O Lord, quoth she, cause do me right,Out not according to my sin;Have you not promised day and night,t.When sinners knock to let them in.He said thou wrests the scriptures wrongThe night is come thou spent the day,In whoredom thou hast lived long,And to repent thou didst delay ;Still my commandments thou abus’dst,And vice committedst busily,Since now my mercy thou refus’dst,Go down to hell eternally.0 Lord, my soul doth testify,That I have spent my life in vain;Ah !

A few years ago acopy of his poem, called “ The Cotton Mill,” was given toMr Buchanan, of Catrine, who sent the author a presentof a sovereign. This gift seems to have arrived very op¬portunely, if we may judge from the lines it occasioned.Addressing the sovereign, the Poet says—“ Hail ! joy-restorer, of Peruvian ore !Thee, might the victims of distress adore,Not Sol, when rising to a restless swain.Nor stars to sailors on the mighty main.Are “half so welcome as thy sight to me,What have I suffered for the want of thee ?For want of thee my clothes have worn in holes.For want of thee my shoes have wanted soles;For want of thee ( whi le beasts and fowls were fed ),I’ve dropp’d and fainted for the loss of bread;]j§ For want of thee the haughty sons of prideHave turn’d their worthless empty heads aside ;For want of thee I’ve oft endur’d the scornOf nymphs, and frowns of dire oppressors borne;For want of thee I’ve roam’d the country through,And more of sorrow than contentment knew ;For want of thee my jokes have giv’n offence.For want of thee I’ve wanted common sense ;For want of thee when wint’ry terrors spread,I’ve wanted shelter for my aching head ;For want of thee pretended friends have thrownThe mask aside, and what they were, haveshown-iFor want of thee in company have I stood,Mute as a statue, or a post of wood ;When others spoke, or sung with mirth and glee,BjR I’ve wanted utterance for the want of thee.”lEiisaiisais^^w.

SaltmarfrgLTWEEDSIDEiW hat beauties does Flora disclose?How-sweet are her smiles upon Tweed?Vet Mary’s still sweeter than those;Both nature and fancy exceed,No daisy., nor sweet blushing rose,Not all the gay flow’rs of the field,Not Tweed, gliding gently through those,Such beacty and pleasure does yield.The warblers are heard in the grove,The linnet, the lark, and the thrush,The blackbird, and sweet cooing dove,With music enchant ev’ry bush.Come, let us go forth to the mead.Let us see how the primroses spring;We'll lodge in some village on Tweed,And love while the feather’d folks sing.How does my love pass the long day?Does Mary not tend a few sheeprDo they never carelessly stray.While happily she lies asleep ?Tweed's murmurs should lull her to rest,Kind nature indulging my bltss.To ease the soft pains of my breast,I’d steal an ambrosial kiss.3’Tis she does the virgins excel;No beauty with her i#$y compare;Love’s graces around he;’do dwell;She’s fairest where thousands are fairJSay, charmer, where do thy flocks strayOh ! tell me at noon where they feed ?Shall I seek them on sweet winding Tay,Or the pleasanter banks of the Tweed ?HALLOW FAIR.Tune—Fy l-et us a’ to the Bridal.1 here’s fouth of braw Jockes and Jennie^Comes weel buskit into the fair,With ribbons on their cockernonies,And foutn of fine flour in their hair.Maggie she was sae weel busked,That Willie was tied to his bride;The pony was ne’er better whiskedWith a cudgel that hung frae his side,Ma ggie was wondrous jealous,To see Willie busked sae braw;And Sawney he sat in the ale-house,And hard at the iiqour did ca’,There was Georgie that vveel lo’ed his lassie,He took the pint stoop in his arms,And hugged it, and said, Troth they're saucyThat lo’es na a gude father’s bairn.4Fhere was WaUie, the muirland laddie.Was nfounted -:pon a ^icy cowte,With sword by his side, like a caddie.To drive in the sheep and the nowte.His doublet sae weel it did fit him,It scarcely came down to mid-thigh.With hair pouthered, hat, and a feather,And bousing at courpon and tee.But Bruckie played boo to Bawsie,And aff scoured the cowte like the win';Poor Wattie he fell on the causey,And brised a’ the banes in his skin.Ilis pistols fell out of the hulsters,And were a’ bedaubed toith dirt:The folk they came round him in clusters,Some leugh, and cried, Lad, was ye hurtThe cowte wad let naebody steer him,He was aye sae wanton and skcigh;The packmens stands he overturned them,And gart a’ the fair stand abeigh.With sneering behind and before him;For sic is the mettle of brutes;Poor Wattic, and wae’s me for him,Was fain to gang hame in his boots,Now it was late in the ev’ning,And bwghting time was drawing near;5■4The lasses had stenched their grecrdugoWith fouth of braw apples and beer.There was Lillie, and Tibbie, and Sibbie,And Ccicy on the spindle could spin,Stood gicwring at signs and glass winnocio,But dei!

were I bnt some shepherd swain,To feed my flock beside thee:At bughting-iime to leave the plain,In milking to abide thee;I'd think myself a happier man,With Kate, my club, and dogie,7Tlvaa he that hugs his thousands ten,Had I but Kath’rine Ogie.Then I’d despise th’ imperial throne,And statesmen’s dang’rous stations,I’d be no king, I’d wear no crown.I’d smile at conmi’ring nations.Might I caress, and still possessThis lass of whom I’m vogie;For they are toys, and still look less,Compared with Kath’rine Ogie.1 fear the gods have not decreedFor me so fine a creature.Whose beauty rare makes her exceedAll other works in nature.fHouds of de-pair surround my love,That are both dark and foggie;Pity my case, ye powers above!Else I die for Kath’rine Ogie.THE LASS OF ARANTEENIE.Forlorn amang the Highland hills.’Midst Nature’s wildest grmdeur.By rocky dens, an’ woody gien>,With weary steps I wander,The langsome way, the darksome day,The mountain mist sac rain**8Are nought to me when ganu to thee,.Sweet las? o’ Aranteenie.Von mossy rosebud down the howe,Just op’rung fresh an’ bonny,It blinks beneath the hazle bough,An’s scarcely,seen by otty:.Sse sweet amidst her native hills.Obscurely blooms my Jenny,Mair fair ar,’ gay than rosy May,The flow’r o’ Aranteenie,Now from the mountain’s lofty brow,I view the distant ocean,There Av’rice guides the bounding prowAmbition courts promotion;Let Fortune pour her golden store,Her laureifd favours many,liive me but this, my soul’s first wisk,The lass o’ Aranleeoie.FINIS.

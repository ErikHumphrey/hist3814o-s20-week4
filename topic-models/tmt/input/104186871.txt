She vow’d to him her virgin heart,And own'd an equal flame-Her Father Buchan's cruel lord,Their passion disaprov’d:He bale her wed Sir John the Graese,And leave the youth she lov’d—One night they met as they were wont,Deep in a shady wood ;Where on the bank, beside the burn,A blooming saugh tree stood.Conceal'd among the underwood,The crafty Donald lay,The brother of Sir John the Graeme,To watch what they might say.When thus the maid began : My Sire,Our passion disapprovesHe bids me wed Sir John the Graeme,So here mu t end our lovee.My father'e will must be obeyed.Nought boots ms to withstand,-Some fairsr maid in beauty's bloom,Shall bless thee with her hand.Soon will Matilda be forgot,Aad from thy mind effac'd;But may that happiness be tAine,Which I can never taste 1What do 1 hear ?

began the Graeme,Or ha* the felon fled ?This hand shall lay th* wretch on earth*By whom my brother bled.And now the valiant Knight awake,The virg:n shrieking heard,Straight up he rose and drew his sword,When the tierce band appear’d.Your sword last night my brother s'ew,But deeds approve the man,Set by your men, and hand by hand.We’ll try what valour can.Your words sre brave the dhief return’d,But deeds approve the mas,-Set by your men, and hand by hand,We ll try what valour can.With dauntless step be foreward strode,And dar’d him to the fight,The Graeme jave back and fear'd his arm,For well he knew iiu might.Four of his men the bravest four,Sunk down beneath his sword ;But still he scorned the poor revenge,And sought their haughty lord.Behind h'm bisely came the Graeme,And p;erc'u him in the side;Out spouting came the purple stream.And all his tartans dyed.But yet his hand d opp’d not the sword,Nor sunk he to the ground,8Till thro' his enemies' heart the steel,.Had forced a mortal wound.Graeme, like a tree by wind o'erthrown,Fell b*eathless on the clay;And down beside him sunk the EoseiAnd faint and dying lay. , *1Matilda saw and fast she ran,0 spare hi* life, she cried.Lord Buchan's daughter begs his life,Let her not be deny'd.Hel5 well-known voice the hero heard,He rais'd his death clos'd eyes,He fix'd them on the weeping maid,And weakly thus replies.In vain Matilda begs a life,By death's arresr deny'd ;My race is run——adieu my love,’Then clos'd his eyes and dy’d.The sword yet warm, f*om his left side,With fraatic hand she drew,I come, Sir James tire Rose she cry’d,1 come to follow you.The hilt she lean'd against the ground,And bar’d her snowy b' east;Then fell upon her lover’s face,And suck to eniless rest.FiNlv.

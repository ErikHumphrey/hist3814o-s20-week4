TWOFAVOURITE BALLADSTHE BABES IN THE WOOD.LORD GREGORY.GLASGOW:PRINTED FOR THE BOOKSELLERS.7^ OF SCOTLAND rTHE BABES IN THE WCK3D.Now ponder well, you parents dear.The words which I shall write ;A doleful story you shall hear.In time brought forth to light.A gentleman of good accountIn Norfolk liv’d of late,Whose wealth and riches did surmountMost men of his estate.Sore sick he was, and like to die ;No help that he could have ;His wife by him as sick did lie.And both possess’d one grave.No love between these two w7as lost.Each was to other kind ;In love they liv’d, in love they died,And left two babes behind.The one a fine and pretty boy.Not passing three years old ;The other, a girl more young than he,And made in beauty’s mould.The father left his little son,As plainly doth appear,When he to perfect age should come,Three hundred pounds a-year.ooAn<l to his little daughter JauoFive hundred pounds in gold,To be paid down on marriage-day,Which might not be controll’d.But should the children chance to dieEre they to age should conre,Their uncle should possess their wealth,For so the will did run.Now, brother, said the dying man,Look to my children dear ;Be good unto my boy and girl.No friends else I have here :To God and you I do commendMy children night and day ;But little while, be sure, we haveWithin this world to stay.You must be father and mother both,And uncle all in one ;God knows what will become of themWhen I am dead and gone!With that bespake their mother dearO brother kind, quoth she,You are the man must bring our babesTo wealth or misery.And if you keep them carefully,Then God will you reward ;If otherwise you seem to deal,God will your deeds regard.With lips as cold as any .stone,She kiss’d her children 'mall,4God bless you botli, my children clear ;With that the tears did fall.These speeches then their brother spokeTo this sick couple there:—The keeping of your children dear.Sweet sister, do not fear,God never prosper me nor mine.Nor aught else that I have,If 1 do wrong your children clearWhen your laid in the grave.Their parents being dead and gone.The children thence he takes.And brings them home unto his house.And much of them he makes.He had not kept these pretty babesA twelvemonth and a day,Hut for their wealth he did deviseTo make them both away.He bargain’d with two ruffians rude,Which were of furious mood,That they should take the children young,And slay them in a wood.He told his wife, and all he had,He did the children sendTo be brought up in fair London,With one that was his friend.Away then went these pretty babes,Rejoicing at that tide—5Rejoicing with a merry mindThey should on cock-horse ride.They prate and prattle pleasantly.As they rode on the way,To those that should there butchers be.And work there lives’ decay.So that the pretty speech they hadMade murderer’s hearts relent;And they that undertook the deedFull sore they did repent.Yet one of them, more hard of heart.Did vow to do his charge ;Because the wretch that hired himHad paid him very large.The other would not agree thereto,So here they fell at strife :With one another they did fightAbout the children’s life.And he that was of mildest moodDid slay the other there.Within an unfrequented wood.While babes did quake with fear.He took the children by the hand.When tears stood in their eye.And bade them come and go with him.And look they did not cry.And two long miles he led them on.While they for food complain ;Stay here, (quoth he) I’ll bring you breadWhen I do come again.GThese pretty babes, with band m band.Went wandering up and down,But never more they saw the manApproaching from the town.There pretty lips with blackberriesWere all besmear’d and dyed ;And when they saw the darksome night,They sate them down and cried.Thus wander’d these two pretty babesTill death did end their grief—In one anothers arms they died,As babes wanting relief.No burial these pretty babesOf any man receives,Till Robin-red-breast, painfully,Did cover them with leaves.And now the heavy wrath of GodUpon their uncle fellYea, fearful fiends did haunt his house,His conscience felt an hell:His barns were fired, his goods consum’d,His lands were barren made,His cattle died within the field,And nothing with him stay’d.And in the voyage to PortugalTwo of his sons did die ;And to conclude, himself was broughtTo extreme misery:He pawn’d and mortgag’d all his landEre seven years came about;7And now at length this wicked actDid by this means come out.The fellow that did take in handThese children for to kill,Was for a robbery judg’d to die,As was God's blessed will;Who did confess the very truth,The which is here express'd ;Their uncle died while he for debtIn prison long did rest.All you that be executors made.And overseers eke,Of children that be fatherless,^ And infants mild and meek ;Take you example bj this thing.And yield to each his right,Lest God, with such like misery.Your wicked minds requite.LORD GREGORY.0 mirk, mirk is this midnight hour,And loud the tempests roar ;A waefu’ wanderer seeks thy tower.Lord Gregory, ope thy door.An exile frae her father’s ha’.And a’ for loving thee ;At least some pity on me shaw,If love it may na be.8Lord Gregory, mind'st thou not the grove.By bonuie Irwine side,Where first I own’d that virgin-love,I lang, lang had denied ?blow aftcn didst thou pledge and vow.Thou wad for aye be mine !And my fond heart, itsel sae true.It ne’er mistrusted thine.Hard is thy heart, Lord Gregory,And flinty is thy breast:Thou dart of heaven that flashest by,O wilt thou give me rest.Ye mustering thunders from above.Your willing victim see!But spare, and pardon rny fause love.His wrangs to heaven and me.Fib’IS.• «<tu ■ ro n fnem..■/ > ft alixo itfi.; get. i-ioI'js buAno -V - 1* -il iA

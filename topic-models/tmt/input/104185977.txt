And her sire and her people are call’d to her bier.!! Glenara came first, with the mourners and shroud;jj Her kinsmen they follow’d, hut mourn’d not aloud;J Their plaids all their bosoms were folded around;1 They march’d all in silence—they look’d to the groundVI In silence they reach’d over mountain and moor,I To a heath, where the oak-tree grew lonely and hoar,‘Now here let us place the gray stone of her cairn—| Why speak ye no word?’ said Glenara the stem.And tell me, I charge you, ye clan of my spouseWhy fold ye your mantles, why cloud ye your brows?’So spake the rude chieftain : no answer is made,But each mantle unfolding, a dagger display’d.1 ‘ I dream’d of my lady, I dream’d of her shroud,’Cried a voice from the kinsmen, all wrathful andloud ;f And empty that shroud, and that coffin did seem:Glenara ! Glenara ! now read me my dream !’4Oh ! pale grew the cheek of that chieftain, I ween,\Y1 ien the shroud was unclosed, and no body was seen.Tlien a voice from the kinsmen spoke louder in scorn—‘1 was the youth that had lov’d the fair Ellen ofLorn.‘1 dream’d of my lady, I dream’d of her grief,I dream’d that her lord was a barbarous chief;On a rock of the ocean fair Ellen did seem:Glenara ! Glenara ! now read me my dream !’In dust low the traitor has knelt to the ground,And the desert reveal’d where his lady was found ;From the rock of the ocean that beauty is borne ;Now joy to the house of fair Ellen of Lorn !Campbell,BURIAL OF SIR JOHN MOORE.Not a drum was heard, not a funeral note,As his corse to the ramparts we hurried ;Not a soldier discharged his farewell shotO’er the grave where our hero was buried.We buried him darkly ; at dead of night,The sods with our bayonets turning,By the struggling moonbeams’ misty light,And the lantern dimly burningNo useless coffin enclosed his breast.Nor in sheet nor in shroud we wound him ;But he lay—like a warrior taking his rest—With his martial cloak around him !few and short were the prayers we said.And we spoke not a word of sorrow;Jut we steadfastly gazed on the face of the dead.And we bitterly thought of to-morrow—IIIe thought—as we hollowed his narrow bedAnd smoothed down his lonely pillow—low the foe and the stranger would tread o’er hishead,i And we far away on the billow!lightly they’ll talk of the spirit that’s gone,And o’er his cold ashes upbraid him;hit nothing he’ll reck, if they let him sleep onIn the grave where a Briton has laid him.lut half of our heavy task was done,When the clock toll’d the hour for retiring,Lnd we heard by the distant and random gun.That the foe was suddenly firing—Slowly and sadly we laid him down,'rom the field of his fame, fresh and gory !7e carved not a line, we raised not a stone.But we left him—alone with his glory !Wolfe.LORD ULLIN’S DAUGHTER.A chieftain, to the Highlands bound.Cries, * Boatman, do not tarry !And I’ll give thee a silver pound,To row us o’er the ferry.’—G* Now, who he ye would cross Lochgyle,This dark and stormy water?’—0, I’m the chief of Ulva’s isle.And tliis Lord Ullin’s daughter.* And fast before her father’s men.Three days we’ve fled together;For, should he find us in the glen.My blood would stain the heather,* His horsemen hard behind us ride,Should they our steps discover.Then who would cheer my bonny bride,When they have slain her lover ?'Outspoke the hardy Highland wight,‘ I’ll go, my chief—I’m ready :—It is not for your silver bright;But for your winsome lady:And, by my word! the bonny birdIn danger shall not tarry ;So, though the waves are raging white.I’ll row you o’er the ferry !’By this the storm grew loud apace.The water-wraith was shrieking.And in the scowl of heaven, each faceGrew dark as they were speaking.But still, as wilder blew the wind.And as the night grew drearer,Adown the glen rode armed men.Their trampling sounded nearer.—7* Oh ! haste thee, haste !’ the lady cries‘ Though tempests round us gather.I’ll meet the raging of the skies,But not an angry father.’The boat has left a stormy land,A stormy sea before her,—When, oh ! too strong for human hand,The tempest gather’d o’er her.And still they row’d amidst the roarOf waters fast prevailing :Lord Ullin reach’d that fatal shore,His wrath was changed to wailingFor sore dismay’d, through storm and shade.His child he did discover:One lovely arm she stretch’d for aid.And one was round her lover.‘ Come back ! come back !’ he cried in grief,‘ Across this stormy water:And I’ll forgive your Highland chief.My daughter !—oh ! my daughter !'Twas vain ! the loud waves lash’d the shore,Return or aid preventing:The waters wild went o’er his child--And he was left lamenting.BILLY DIP.hiLOE, a maid at fifty-five,Was at her toilette dressing ;Her waiting-maid, with iron hot.Each paper’d curl was pressing.8The looking-glass her eyes engross,While Retty humm’d a ditty ;She gazed so much upon her face.She really thought it pretty.Her painted cheeks and pencil brows.She could not but approve.Her thoughts on various subjects turn’d,At length they fix’d on love:“ And shall,” said she, “a virgin lifeAwait these pleasing charms ?And will no sighing blooming youthReceive me to his arms ?—Forbid it, Love !” She scarce had spoke.When Cupid laid a trap ;For, at the chamber door was heardA soft and gentle rap:Cried Betty, '‘‘who is at the door?”“Aye tell,” quoth Chloe, “true:”When straight a tender voice replied,“ Dear ma’am, I dye for you“ What’s that,” she said, “O, Betty, say !A man ! and die for me !And can I see the youth expire—Oh, no ! it must not be !Haste, Betty,—open quick the door:”’ Tis done; and, lo ! to view,A little man with bundle stood.In sleeves and apron blueYe Powers !” cried Chloe, “what is this?What vision do I see ?Is this the man, oh, mighty Love !—The man that dies for me?”“ Yes ma’am; your ladyship is right,”The figure straight replied ;“ And hard for me it would have beenIf I had never dved.9La ! ma’am, you must have heard of me,’Although I’m no highflyer ;I live just by at No. 1,I’m Billy Dip, the dyer.Twas I, ma’am, Betty there employedTo dye your lustering gown ;And I not only dye for youBut I dye for the whole town,”THE WELL OF ST. KEYNE.A well there is in the west country.And a clearer one never was seen ;There is not a wife in the west countryBut has heard of the well of St. Keyne.An oak and an elm-tree stand beside.And behind does an ash-tree grow.And a willow from the bank aboveDroops to the water below.A traveller came to the well of St. Keyne;Joyfully he drew nigh.For from cock-crow he had been travelling.And there was not a cloud in the sky.He drank of the water so cool and clear.For thirsty and hot was he.And he sat down upon the bankUnder the willow tree.There came a man from the neighbouring town. At the well to fill his pail;On the well-side he rested it.And he bade the stranger hail.iO"Now art tliou a bachelor, stranger5” auoth he," For an if thou hast a wife.The happiest draught thou hast drunk this dayThat ever thou didst in thy life." Or, has thy good woman, if one thou hast.Ever here in Cornwall been ?For an if she have. I’ll venture my lifeShe has drunk of the well of St. Keyne.”" I have left a good woman who never was here,”The stranger he made reply," But that my draught should be better for that,I pray you answer me why ?”" St. Keyne,” quoth the Cornishman, " many atimeDrank of this crystal well.And before the Angel summon’d her.She laid on the water a spell:—" If the husband—of this gifted wellShall drink before his wife,A happy man henceforth is he.For he shall be master for life."But if the wife should drink of it first,—Oh, pity the husband then !”The stranger stoop’d to the well of St. Keyne,And drank of the water again." You drank of the well I warrant betimes ?”He to the Cornishman said:But the Cornishman smiled as the stranger spake,And sheepishly shook his head.In‘ I hasten'd as soon as the wedding was don*And left my wife in the porch;dut in truth rhe'd been wiser than I,For she took a bottle to church.”HOHENLINDES.On Linden, when the sun was tow.All bloodless lay the untrodden snow.And dark as winter was the flow'Of Iser rolling rapidly.But Linden saw another sight,When the drum heat at dead of night,Commanding fires of death to lightThe darkness of her scenery !By torch and trumpet fast array’d.Each horseman drew his battle-blade.And furious every charger neigh’d.To join the dreadful revelry.Then shook the hills with thunder riven.Then rush’d the steed to battle driven.And louder than the bolts of Heaven,Far flash’d the red artillery.But redder yet that light shall glow,On Linden’s hills of stained snow ;And bloodier yet the torrent flowOf Iser rolling rappidly.Tis morn—but scarce yon level sunCan pierce the war-clouds rolling dun.Where furious Frank and fiery HunShout in their sulphurous canopy.12The comhat deepens—On, ye brave.Who rush to glory or the grave ;W ave, Munich, all thy banners waveAnd charge with all thy chivalry !Few, few shall part where many meetThe snow shall be their winding sheetAnd every turf beneath their feetShall be a soldier’s sepulchre.ODE TO ELOQUENCEHeard ye those loud contending waves,That shook Cecropia’s pillar’d state ?Saw ye the mighty from their gravesLook up, and tremble at her fate ?Who shall calm the angry storm ?Who the mighty task performAnd bid the raging tumult cease.See, the son of Hermes rise.With syren tongue, and speaking eyes,Hush the noise, and sooth to peace 1See the olive branches wavingO’er Illissus winding stream.Their lovely limbs the Naiads laving,The Muses smiling by, supreme !See the nymphs and swains advancing.To harmonious measures dancing:Grateful lo Pams riseTo thee, O Power ! who canst inspireSoothing words—or words of fire,And shookst thy plumes in Attic skies !Lo ! from the regions of the north.The reddening storm of battle pours,Rolls along the trembling earth.Fastens on the Olynthian towers.“ Where rests the sword ?—where sleep the brave ?Awake ! Cecropia’s ally saveFrom the fury of the blast:Burst the storm on Phocis’ walls !Rise ! or Greece for ever falls ;Up ! or Freedom breathes her last!”The jarring states, obsequious now.View the Patriot’s band on high ;Thunder gathering on his brow.Lightning flashing from his eye !Borne by the tide of words along.One mind, one voice, inspire the throng! —“ To arms ! to arms ! to arms !” they cry,“ Grasp the shield, and draw the sword,Lead us to Philippi’s lord.Let us conquer him, or die!”Ah, eloquence ! thou wast undone;Wast from thy native country drivenWhen Tyranny eclipsed the sun.And blotted out the stars of heaven !When liberty from Greece withdrew,And o’er the Adriatic flewTo where the Tiber pours his urn—»She struck the rude Tarpeian rock,Sparks were kindled by the stroke--Again thy fires began to burn !14Now shining forth, thou mad’st compliantThe conscript fathers to thy charms.Roused the world-hestriding giant.Sinking fast in Slavery’s arms !I see thee stand by freedom’s fane.Pouring the persuasive strain.Giving vast conceptions birth:Hark ! I hear thy thunders sound,Shake the Forum round and roundShake the pillars of the earth'First-born of Liberty divine !Put on Religion’s bright array :Speak ! and the starless grave shall shineThe portal of eternal day !Rise, kindling with the orient beam.Let Calvary’s hill inspire the theme.Unfold the ganuehts roll’d in blood!Oh, touch the soul—touch all her chordsWith all thy omnipotence of words,And point the way to heaven—to Godtell’s speech.Ye crags and peaks, I’m with you once again!I hold to you the hands you first beheld.To show they still are free. Methinks I hearA spirit in your echoes answer me.And bid your tenant welcome to his homeAgain !—O sacred forms, how proud you look !How high you lift your heads into the sky!How huge you are ! how mighty and how free !15i Ye are the things that tower, that shine—whosesmile'! Makes glad—whose frown is terrible—whose forme,Robed or unrobed, do all the impress wearOf awe divine. Ye guards of libertyI’m with you once again !—I call to youWith all my voice !—I hold my hands to youTo show they still are free. I rush to youAs though I could embrace you !Scaling yonder peak,I I saw an eagle wheeling near its browO’er the abyss :—his broad-expanded wingsLay calm and motionless upon the air.As if he floated there without their aid.By the sole act of his unlorded will.That buoy’d him proudly up. InstinctivelyJI bent my bow; yet kept he rounding stillr| His airy circle, as in the delightI’ Of measuring the ample range beneath,And round about absorb’d, he heeded notThe death that threaten’d him.—I could not shoot—’Twas liberty !—I turned my bow aside.And let him soar away !Heavens, with what pride I usedTo walk these hills and look up to my GodAnd bless him that it was so. It was free—From end to end, from cliff to lake ’twas free !Free as our torrents are that leap our rocks,And plough our valleys, without asking leave;Or as our peaks that wear their caps of snow,In very presence of the regal sun.How happy was it then ! I lovedIts very storms. Yes, Emma, I have satIn my boat at night, when, midway o’er the lake,1] The stars went out, and down the mountain gorge16Hie wind came roaring. I have sat and eyedThe thunder breaking from his cloud, and smiledTo see him shake his lightnings o’er my head.And think I had no master save his own.You know the jutting cliff round which a trackUp hither winds, whose base is hut the browTo such another one, with scanty roomFor two a-hreast to pass ? O’ertaken thereBy the mountain blast, I’ve laid me flat along.And while gust followed gust more furiously.As if to sweep me o’er the horrid brinkAnd I have thought of other lands, whose stormsAre summer flaws to those of mine, and justHave wished me there—the thought that mine wasfreeHas check’d that wish, and I have raised my head.And cried in thraldom to that furious wind.Blow on ! This is the land of liberty !THE STAR OF BETHLEHEM.When marshall’d on the mighty plain,The glittering host hestud the sky ;One star alone, of all the train.Can fix the sinner’s wandering eye.Hark ! hark ! to God the chorus breaks,From every host, from every gem ;But one alone the Saviour speaks,It is the star of Bethlehem.Once on the raging seas I rode.The storm was loud—the night was dark,The ocean yawn’d—and rudely blow’dThe wind that toss’d my foundering bark.17Deep horror then my vitals froze,Death-struck, I ceas’d the tide to stem}When suddenly a star arose,—It was the star of Bethlehem.It was my guide, my light, my all.It hade my dark forebodings cease ;And, through the storm and danger’s thrall.It led me to the port of peace.Now safely moor’d—my perils o’er,I’ll sing, first in night’s diademFor ever and for evermore,The Star !—The Star of Bethlehem !THE THREE BLACK CROWS.|Two honest tradesmen meeting in the Strand,ne took the other briskly by the hand—Hark ye,’ said he ‘ ’tis an odd story this!U‘ About the crows !’—‘ I don’t know Avhat it is,’jijReply’d his friend ; ‘ No ! I’m surpris’d at that.Where I come from it is the common chat;But you shall hear:—an odd affair indeed.And that it happen’d they are all agreed.Not to detain you from a thing so strange,A gentleman that lives not far from ’Change,‘ This week, in short, as all the Alley knows,Taking a puke has thrown up three black crows !* Impossible !’ ‘ Nay, but ’tis really true;I have it from good hands, and so may you.’r From whose, I pray ?’ so having nam’d the man,Straight, to enquire, his curious comrade ran.y Sir did you tell?’—relating the affair—J]‘ Yes Sir, 1 did, and if ’tis worth your care,18‘ Ask Mr Such-a-one, he told it me,‘ But hy the bye, ’twas two black crows, not three.Resolv’d to trace so wondrous an event.Quick to the third, the virtuoso went:—‘ Sir’—and so forth, ’Why yes, the thing is fact, j' Though in regard to number, not exact;‘ It was not two black crows, ’twas only one,‘ The truth of that you may depend upon :* The gentleman himself told me the case.’‘ Where may I find him ?’ ‘ Why in such a place.’1;Away goes he, and having found him out,‘ Sir, he so good as to resolve a doubt;’Then to his last informant he referr’d.And begg’d to know if true what he had heard— ;|‘ Did you Sir, throw up a black crow ?’ * Not I,’‘ Bless me, how people propagate a lie !‘ Black crows have been thrown up, three, two, and one,‘ And here I find all comes at last to none !‘ Did you say nothing of a crow at all ?’‘ Crow ! crow ! perhaps I might, now I recall‘ The matter o’er.’ ‘ And pray. Sir, what was’t ?’‘ Why, I was horrid sick, and at the last,‘ I did throw up, and told my neighbour so,* Something that was—as black Sir, as a crow !’THE ORPHAN BOY.Stay, Lady—stay, for mercy’s sake.And hear a helpless Orphan’s tale;Ah ! sure my looks must pity wake,’Tis want that makes my cheeks so pale.Yet I was once a mother’s pride.And my brave father’s hope and joy tBut in the Nile’s proud fight he di d.And I am now an Orphan Boy !IDT’oor foolish child—how pleas’d was \When news of Nelson’s victory came 3Along the cronded streets to fly.To see the lighted windows flame !To force me home my mother sought.She could not bear to see my joy:For with my father’s life ’twas bought.And made me a poor Orphan Boy !I he people’s shouts were long and loud.My mother shudd’ring, clos’d her ears ;Rejoice ! rejoice ! still cry'd the croud.My mother answer’d with her tears !Why are you crying thus, said I,While others laugh and shout with joyShe kiss’d me, and with such a sigh.She call’d me her poor Ornhan Boy !Wbat is an Orphan Boy? I cry’d.As in her face I. look’d and smil’d.My mother through her tears reply’d,‘ You’ll know to soon, ill-fated child.’And now they’ve toll’d my mother’s knell.And I’m no more a parent’s joy :Ah !

this to me :You’ll give me clothing, food, employ 5Look down, dear parents! look and seeYour happy—happy Orphan Boy !THE PIG IN A POCK.A farmer’s lease contain’d a flaw,To mend it he appeal’d to law,Dear-bought experience told him plainThat law without a fee was vain ;And that, to clear his counsel’s tone, hoMust bribe him with meat or money.One mom he calls his clown-in-chief,“ Here, take this pig to Lawyer Brief.”The clown (unlike his wife, they say,)Could both be silent and obey:The pig secured within a sack,At ease hang dangling from his back;Thus loaded, straight to town he went,With many an awkward compliment.A half-way house convenient stood.Where host was kind, and ale was good:In steps the clown, and calls to Cecil—“ A quart of stout, to whit my whistle !”Eased of his load he takes a chair.And quaffs oblivion to all care.Three artful wags accost the clown.And ask his errand up to town.With potent ale his heart grown warm,Which, drunk or sober, meant no harm:He told them plainly whence he came,—Mis master and the lawyer’s name ;I21And, ere the circling mug was drain’d,Show’d what the prostrate sack contain’d.Whilst two the witless clown amuse,With merry tales and mournful news,A third removes the sack unseen,And soon sets free the guest within;But lest the clown the trick should trace,A well fed cur supplies the place.The point clear’d up of what’s to pay,Our clown in peace pursued his way:Arrived, he makes his awkward how,With many a wherefore and as how.“ Heaven hliss your honour many a year !Look what a pig I’ve brought you here.”The sack untied without demur,Forwith out gently crept the cur.Both stood aghast with eager eyes.And both, no doubt, look'd wondrous wise—The clown, who saw the lawyer foam.Swore ’twas a pig when brought from home;And wond’ring at the queer disaster,In haste return’d to tell his master.Well pleased to see him take the bait,The wags his quick return await;What peals of noisy mirth prevail.To hear him tell the mystic tale !-—From them to Cecil he repairs,To her the strange event declares:Meantime the wags, to end the joke.Replace the pig within its pock.22The rustic soon resumes his load.And, whistling, plods along the road.The impatient farmer hails the clown,And asks, “What news from London town.The pig was liked ; they made you drink ?”“ Nay, master ! master ! what d’ye think ?The pig (or I am a stupid log,)Is changed into a puppy dog;”“A dog!”—‘‘Nay since my word you doubt jjSee here ; I’ll fairly turn him out.”No sooner was the sack untied.Than a loud grunt his word belied:“ Death !” cries the farmer, “tell me whence.Proceeds this daring insolence ?Make haste, you blunderer, take it back.Or from my service you shall pack !”The clown in patient soul and blood,A while in silent wonder stood;Then briefly cried, with phiz demure,—“ Yon lawyer is a witch, for sure !How hoarse his voice ! his face how grim !What’s pig with us is dog with him:—O master save me from derision.For as I live I’ve seen a vision !”ADDRESS TO THE OCEAN.There is a pleasure in the pathless woods,There is a rapture on the lonely shore.There is society, where none intrudes.By the deep Sea, and music in its roar:I love not Man the less, but Nature more,m23From these our interviews, in which I stealFrom all I may he, or have heen before.To mingle with the Universe, and feelWhat I can ne’er express, yet can not all conceal.Roll on, thou deep and dark blue ocean—roll!Ten thousand fleets sweep over thee in vain;Man marks the earth with ruin—his controlStops with the shoreupon the watery plainThe wrecks are all thy deed, nor doth remainA shaddow of man’s ravage, save his own.When, for a moment, like a drop of rain,Ke sinks into thy depths with bubbling groan,Without a grave, unknell’d, uncoffin’d, and unknownHis steps are not upon thy paths,—thy fieldsAre not a spoil for him,—thou dost ariseAnd shake him from ; the vile strength he wieldsFor earth’s destruction thou doest all despise.Spurning him from thy bosom to the skies,And send’st him shivering in thy playful spraAnd howling, to his Gods, where haply liesHis petty hope in some near port or bay.And dashest him again to earth:—there let him lay.The armaments which thunderstrike the wallsOf rock-built cities, bidding nations quake.And monarches tremble in their capitals.The oak leviathans, whose huge ribs makeTheir clay creator the vain title takeOf lord of thee, and arbiter of war;These are thy toys, and, as the snowy flake.They melt into thy yeast of waves, which maiMike the Armada’s pM*. or spoils of Trafalgar.24rFhy shores are empires, changed in all save thee—Assyria, Greece, Rome, Carthage, what arethey ?Thy waters wasted them while they were tree,And many a tyrant since; their shores obeyT he stranger, slave, or savage ; their decayHas dried up realms to deserts:—not so thou,Unchangeable save to thy wild waves’ play—Time writes no wrinkle on thine azure brow—Such as creation’s dawn beheld, thou rollest now.Thou glorious mirror, where the Almighty’s formGlasses itself in tempests; in all frime,Calm or convuls'd—in breeze, or gale, or storm.Icing the pole, or in the torrid climeDark-heaving;—boundless, endless, and sublime.The image of Eternity—the throneOf the Invisible ; even from out thy slimeThe monsters of the deep are made; each zoneObeys thee; thou goest forth, dread, fathomless, alone.And I have lov’d thee. Ocean ! and my joyOf youthful sports was on thy breast to beBorne, like thy bubbles, onward: from a boyI wanton’d with thy breakers—they to meWere a delight; and if the freshening seaMade them a terror—twas a pleasing fear.For I was as it were a child of thee.And trusted to thy billows far and nearAnd laid my hand upon thy mane—as 1 do here.

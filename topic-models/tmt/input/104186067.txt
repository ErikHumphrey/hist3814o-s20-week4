Conceal’d beneath a mangled heap,His hurried search had miss’d,All glowing from his rosy sleep.His cherub boy he kiss’d !Nor scratch had he, nor harm nor dread—But the same couch beneath,Lay a great wolf, all torn and dead—-Tremendous still in death !Ah ! what was then Llewellyn’s pain !For now the truth was clear;The gallant hound the wolf had slain.To save Llewellyn’s heir.Vain, vain was all Llewellyn’s woe:“ Best of thy kind, adieu !I The frantic deed which laid thee low.This heart shall ever me l”And now a gallant tomb they raise,With costly sculpture deck’d;And marbles, storied with his praise,Poor Gelert’s bones protect.Here never could the spearmen pass,Or forester, unmoved;Here oft the tear-bespringled grassLlewellyn’s sorrow proved.f rHAnd hear he hung his horn and spear;And, oft as evening fell.In Fancy’s piercing sounds would hearPoor Gelert’s dying yell!there’s scarlet tae ye noo !A Highlander entered a haberdasher’s shop iijDundee, some time ago, and asked for a piece cscarlet cloth to make him a waistcoat.

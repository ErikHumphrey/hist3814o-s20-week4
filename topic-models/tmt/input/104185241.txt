'PRINTED FOR THE BOOKSELLERS.1871.BLOODY DUNDEE.Tune—“Bonnie Dundee.’'A Monument dazzles in brass at Auld Deer,In the chapel where surplice and altar appear.To the tool of the tyrant—the foe of the free,To Claverhouse Graham—to the bloody Dundee.Oh, he was the Sportsman ! Dragoons were his dogs,That hunted our fathers o’er mountains and hogs,Till the bible and swords of Drumclog made him flee,When the speed of his charger saved bloody Dundee.But', burning with vengeance to Cov’nant and Whig,When aided by {reach’ry at Bothwell’s old Brig,He butchered the swordless, no quarter gave he—A wolf among sheep was the bloody Dundee.From the moss to his cottage he dragged godly Brown!And scarcely allowed him in prayer to kneel down;But growled with an oath that he preached on his knee,—So mad a blasphemer was bloody Dundee.He turned to his “ Satans,”—to fire gave command;But they drew not a trigger, they raised not a hand;For the prayer of the Martyr has blinded each e’e.And they heed not the voice of the b'oody Dundee.But Claver’se his pride and his passion restrained,While he drew h n th a pistol his butcheries had stained,And the brains of his victim soon spatter the lea,Then away with his “ lambs ” rode the bloody Dundee.Now close to tbeir mother her infants have crept,As she hound tip the fragments, then sat down and wept.Her wings o’er her brood in their terror spread she,But Binrory requited the bloody Dundee 1He tortured poor children until they revealedThe holes and the hags that their parents concealed•The weakness of woman enliven'd his gk ,So kind and gallant was the bloody Dundee!When James, as a Papist, forfaulted the throne,His subjects rejoiced that the Darkness had down;The gleam of the Orange illumined the seaAnd brought freedom in spite of the bloody Dundee.But Claver’se has summoned the clans from the hilis,That the Lowlands may swallow “ black Prelac}'s” pills;For claymores can teach, and the axe make you see.That justice and truth ride with bloody Dundee!Say, wild Killiecrankie, shall Scotland hear mass,And Protestants pine in Dunnottar and Bass ?No! William approaching makes bigotry dee,And tyranny fall with the bloody Dundee.Then Monuments garnish with thumbkin and chains.To the Man whom the blood of our Martyrs bestains;Till Buchan’s wide plains, from the hills to the sea,Shall shudder to mouband the bloody Dundee.<YOUR AIN FIRESIDE.Tone—“Kelvin Q-rove" \ ^Would you banish care and gloomFrae your ain dreside.Oh, let Temperance bud and bloemAt your ain fireside;Then your canty wifie’s smileWill the cares of life beguile,And allay the pains of toilAt your ain fireside.Oil, how sweet the artless joysAt your ain fireside, _While your gleesome girls and boy?Cheer your ain fireside;Or can blyther sight he seen,As they round your board convene,Fresh and fair as olives greenBy your ain fireside ?Would you force the bitter tearAt year ain fireside,Frae the heart yor vow’d to cheerAt your ain fireside ?Could you see the fading cheekStill her smother’d grief bespeak,And afar your pleasure seek,Frae your ain fireside 8Have you vow’d to train for heavenAt your ain fireside,Those sweet flow’ries kindly givenTo your ain fireside ?Could you see their bloom decline,While in cold and want they pine.Or run wild in heart and min’,, At your aiu fireside ?Would you dread the serpent’s fangAt your ain fireside ?Or the deadly adder’s stangAt your ain fireside ?Frae the drunkard’s drink abstain,And your sair-won penny hain;Then will peace and pleasure reignAt your ain fireside.ftJj YT: ' >*THE BLUE PEAT-REEIv.Tune—“4/i!o» Water’’Apain on the mountains, tho’ spechled wi' snaw,Mid the whir o’ the pertrick an’ ptarmigan's craw jThe mists o’ the morning alang their sides streik,An' mingle their locks wi’ the blue Peat-reck.The wind-flower is blushin’, the primrose blinks forth,As envious Winter maun creep farther north ;The rain frae the hills gies the burn a bit eik,An it soughs o’ the days o’ the auld Peat-reek,When life was a budlet, an’ a’thing was new,An’ daily our Glen brought its wonders to view;When thro’ the wee lozen the sunbeam wad keik,We gazed on the motes, as they reeled in the Reel:.Oh, blythe war the days when we hied to the moss';For, fast as our father the greeu peats wad toss,We rowed them awa' in the vvinraws to beik,That Winter might smile thro’ the warm Peat-reek.Then roun’ the kail-bicker we a’ wad convene,In the eyes of Affection, like olive-plants green;The chapter was read ere our eyelids wad steik,An’ we praised Him that fed us beside the Peat-reek.When youngsters shot up, an’ nac room could be fouu’The only resource was the gun or the ioun;Then blessing an’ farewell the tongue scarce could speak,An’ the last glimpse o’ hame was its blue Peat-reek.The whirl o’ the warkshop lang daivert tho head,An’ the roar o’ the causeway wad deave a ire to dead;The sulphur-coal smoke clouded day’s cauler skreik,An’ sair lung’d the heart for the blue Peat-reek./;' $When Britain commanded her troops to advance,On the mountains o’ Spain or the valleys o’ France,To quell the oppressor or succour the weak,The plaid o’ the foremost smel’d strong o’ Peat-reek.But sadly we wander o’er solitudes wide.Where Scotland ance nour'shed the sons o’ her pride;There roam flocks o’ bleaters an’ deer fat and sleek,But cauld’s the hearth-stane that sent up the Peat-reek,Oh, when will our Lairds clear the land o' their game,An’ a’ their deer-forests an’ sheep-walks reclaim,Nor force the young peasant his fortune to se k,Sae far frae his hame an’ its blue Peat-reek!fj;r • .

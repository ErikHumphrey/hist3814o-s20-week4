who did thee send ?I go to raise the brave clan Rose,Their master to defend.For he has slain fierce Donald Grseme,His blood is,on his sword,And far, far distant are his men,Nor can assist their lord.And has he slain my brother dear ?The furious chief rephes ;Dishonour blast my name but heBy me ere morning dies.Say page where is Sir James the Rose ?I will thee well reward—He sleeps into Lord Buchan’s park,Matilda is his guard.They spurred their steeds and furious flewLike lightening o’er the lea :They reached Lord Buchan’s lofty towers,By dawning of the day.Matilda stood without the gate.Upon a rising ground,And watched each object in the dawn,All ear to every sound.Where sleeps the Rose ? began the Greeme,Or has the felon fled ?This hand shalljlay the wretch on earth,By whom my brother bled.Last daj at noon, Matilda 'said.Sir James"tho Rose passed by,Well mounted on his'noblo steed,And onward fast did hie.By this time he’s at Edinburgh town,If horse and man hold good;—Tour page then lied who said he wasNow sleeping in the wood.She wrung her hands, and tore her hair.Brave Rose thou art betrayed,And ruined by those very meansFrom whence I hoped thine aid.And now the valiant knight awoke,The virgin shrieking heard;Straight up he rose and drew his sword,When the fierce band appeared.Your sword last night my brother slew,His blood yet dims its shine;And ere the sun shall gild the morn,Tour blood shall reek on mine.Tour words are brave, the chief returned,But deeds approve the man.Set by your men, and hand to handWe’ll try what valour can.WithAuiThe Graeme gave back, he feared hi alarm,For wall he knew his might.Four of his men, the bravest four,Sunk down beneath his sword;But still he scorned the poor revenge.And sought their haughty lord.dauntless step he forward strode,1 dared him to the fight;sReliiud Uun baselr a&me the Qrteuie,And pierced bim in the side;Out spouting came the purple stream,And all his tartans dyed.But yet his hand dropped not the sword,Nor sank he to the ground,Till through his enemy’s heart the steelHad forced a mortal wound.Grseme, like a tree by wind o’erthrown,Fell breathless on the clay;And down beside him sank the Bose,And faint and dying lay.Matilda saw and'fast she ran,0 spare his life, she cried;Lord Buchan’s daughter begs his life,Let her not be denied.Her well-known voice the hero heard.And raised his death closed eyes.He fixed them on the weeping maid,And weakly thus replies:In vain'Matilda begs a life,By death’s arrest denied;My race is run—adieu, my love ;Then closed his eyes and died.The sword yet warm from his left side,With frantic hand she drew jI come, Sir James the Hose, she cried,1 come to follow you.The hilt she leaned against the ground,And bared her snowy breast,Then fell upon her lover’s face,And sunk to endless rest.

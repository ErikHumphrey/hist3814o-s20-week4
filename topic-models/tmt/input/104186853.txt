, ALI BABA,OR THEA TALE.r.! r> \ f »STIRLING :PRINTED FOIl WILLIAM MAClilB,BookseUer.AT I BABA,OB THEFORTY THIEVES.liftTN a town of Persia there lived two b?■fillers, the sons of a poor man, the owas named Cassim, and the other Ali J3aCassim, the'eM^r, married a wife withconsiderable fortune, and. lived 3t his eain a handsome house, with plenty of S(vants ; but the ife of Aii Baba was s po (as himself; the^ dwelt in a mean cottagethe suburbs of the city, and ne maintain*his fami^' by cutting wood in a neighbou ticg forest.One day when Ali Baba was in the foresand pieparing to load his asses with tHwood he bad cut, he saw a troop of horsmen approaching toward him. He had c3:i:ten heard of robbers who infested that forest,11and, in a great fright, he hastily climbed a11large thick tree, which stood near he footifof a rock, and hid himself among the: branches.The horsemen soon galloped up to therocl£, where they all dismounted. Ali Baba1 counted forty of them, and he cd$ld not; doubt but they'’ were thieves, by their ill-looking countenances. They each took a: loaded portmanteau from his horsfe, and heI who seemed to be their captain, turning tothe rock, said Open, Sesame, and imme-j diately a door opened in the rock, and alllithe robbers passed in, when the door shutof itself. In a short; limb the door opened(again, and the forty robbers came out, fol-i lowed by their captain, who said, Shut Be¬rn same. The door instantly closed, anfl the«| troop, mounting their hofses, Mjpre present-. ly out of sight.Ah Baba remained in the tree a longfill time, and seeing that ;be robbers did notc return, he venture^ down, and approaching:close to the rock, said, Open, Sesame. Im¬mediately the door flevv open, and Ali Baban beheld a spacious cavern, ,'iery light, andi filled with ail sorts of provisions, merchan¬dise, rich stuffs and.heaps of gold and sil-•i ' coin, which these robbers had takenm merchants and travellers. Ali Baba(then went in search of his asses, and havingj brought them to the rock, took as many4.bass of srold coin as they could carry, anptiT thera on rnir backs, covering tbeiwith soin biose faggots of wood, and aftei ^w r 's | not forgetting to say, Shut, Sesame,1he drove the asses back to the city, anhaving unloaded them in the stable belonginr to his cottage, earned the bags info Mhouse, and spread the £old coin out upo J|the floor before his wife.Hjs wife, delighted with possessing &mfieri money, wanted to count it, but find1ing it would tMie up too much time, she waresolved to mea-ure it, and running to th :house of Ali Baba’s brother, she entreate*'them to lend her a small measure.Cassim’s wife wac very proud and envious : “ l wonder,” she said to herself“ what sort of grain such poor people caj f“^ve to measure, but 1 am determinedwill finrLarat what they are doing ” S> ibefore she gave the measure, she artfulh ’rubbed the bottom with some suet.Away ran Ali Baba’s wife, measured hemoney, and having helped her husband ti 1bury it in the yard, she carried back th imeasure to her brother-in law’s house, with f:out perceiving that a piece of gold was lefl fsticking to the bottom of it.“ Fine doings, indeed !” cried 'Cassim*wife to her husband, after examining thi (measure, “ your brother tliere, who prfl tt“ tends to be so very poor, is richer thai £0{Jr* you are, for he does not count his monev..^ but measu-es it.”Cassim hearing these words, and seeingIthe piece of gold, grew as envious as hiswife, and hastening to his brother, tnreaten-ed to inform the Cadi of his wealth, if hedid not confess to him how he came by it.tAli Baba, without hesitation, told him thenhistorv of the robbers, and the secret ofthe cave, and offered him half his treasure,ibut the envious Cassim disdained so poor aisum, resolving to have fifty times more than[that out of the robbers’ c^ve.Accordingly he rose early the next morn-.|ing, and set out with ten mules loaded withjgreat chests. He found the rock easilylenough by Ah Baba’s description, and hav-ting said, Open, Sesame, he gained admissionnnto the cave, where he found more trei-Isure than he even had expected to beholdi from his brother’s account of it. He im-| mediately began to gather bags of gold,pnd pieces of rich brocades, all which hepiled close to the door, but when he hadgot together as much, or even more thanhis ten mules could possibly carry, andwanted to get out to load them, the thoughtsof his wonderfnl riches had made him en¬tirely forget the word which caused thedoor to open, in vain he tried Bame, Fame,Lame, Tetame, and a thousand others, thedoor remained as immoveable as the rockitself, notwithstanding Cassim kicked amisciimed, till he was ready to drop with litigae and vexation. Presently he hearthe sound of horses’ feet, which he rightlconcluded to be the robber5, and he trembled lest he should now fall a victim to hthrist in riches.He resolved however to make some effoto escape ; and when hd heard Sesame pronounced, he saw the door open, he sprungout; but was instantly put .to death by thsword of the robbers.The thieves now held a council, but none of them could possibly guess by whameans Cassim had got into the cave. Thesaw the heaps of treasure he had piled ready to take away, but they did not miswhat Ali Baba had secured before Atlength they agreed to cm Cassim’s body into four quarters, and hang'.tne pieces within the cave, that it might terrify .any onfrom further attempts; and aUo detern inecnot to return themselves for some time tcthe cave, for fear of being watched and dis¬covered.When Cassim’s wife saw night come oniand her husband not returned, she becangreatly terrified. . She watched at her win¬dow till day-break, and then went to tel!Ali Baba of her fears, Cassim had not informed hint of his design of going to thecave, but Ali Baba, now hearing of his jour¬ney thither, did not wait to be desired to1go in search of hum&fHe drove his asses to the forest withoutI delay He was alarmed to *ee blood near'the rock, and on entering the cave, he|found the body of ids unfortunate brothercut to pieces, and hung up within the door,lit was now too late to save him, but he tookdown the quarters, and put them upon oneof his asses, covering them with faggots ofwood, and weeping for the miserable endof his brother, he regained the city.The door of his brother’s house wasI opened by Morgiana, an intelligent faithfuli female slave, who Ali Baba knew was wor¬thy to be trusted with the secret. Hetherefore delivered the body to Morgiana,, and w ent himself to impart the sad tidings'Ho the wife of Cassim. The poor womanfei was deeply afflicted, and reproached herselfwith her foolish envy and curiosity, as be¬ing the cause of her husband’s death, butAli Baba having convinced her of the ne¬cessity of being very discreet, she checkedher lamentations, and resolved to leaveevery thing to the management of Mor¬giana.Morgiana having washed toe body, has¬tened to an apothecary, and asked forsome particular medicine, saying it was foriher master Cassim, who was dangerouslyill. She fook care to spread the report ofj.Cassim’s illness through the neighbourhood,and as they saw Ali Baba ^nd his wife go*ing daily to the house of their brother in^reat affliction, they were not Surprised 1hear shorty that Cassim had died of his diorder.The next difficulty was to bury him witout discovery; but Morgiaija was readycontrive a plan for that also. She put oiher veil,'and went to a distant part of tilcity very early in the morning, where sljfound a poor cobler, just opening his stairShe put a piece of gold into his hand; ar|told him he should have another, if 1^v'ould suffer himself to be blindfolded, arjgo with her, carrying his tools with liin 1Mustapha the cohler hesitated at first; hi 'the gold tempted him, ard he consented 'when Morgiana, carefully covering his eyeso that he could not see a step of the wajled him to C assim’s house; and taking hi]to the room where the body was lying, rj 1moved the bandage from his eyes, and badhim sew the mangled limbs together.Mustapha obeyed her order; and bavinreceived two pieces of gold, was lea olim 'folded the same way back to his own stall.,Morgisna then covering the body with’ ■winding sheet, sent for the undertaker Imake preparations for the funeral; and Ta fsim was buried with all due solemnity tinvery day.Ali Baba now removed his few goodsand all his gold coin that hs had brougli •from the cavern, to the house of his dLceased brother, of which he took ppsse:1 sion; and Cassims widow received everyI Icind attention both from Aii Baba and his| wife.t ' after an interval of some months, theI troop-of robbers again visited their retreatt in the forest, and were completely astomsh-i ea to find the hoc) taken away from the| cave, and every thing else reinri ting in itsusual Oi ter. “We are discot t ic1' --aidl the captain, “and sh£d: certainly oe undone“ if we do not adopt-speedy measures to41 prevent our ruin Which of you, my1 “ brave comrade- will undertake to searchJ“ out the villian who is in possession of our“ secret ?” VOnttof the boldest ^if tbe troop ; Jvanc-,.|ed, aha offered iiirns- ii. hnd was accepted!on tlie following conditions ; namely, thatif he succeeded hi iiis enterprise, he was tobe made second in cowimpnd of the troop jSbiif thai ifdve brought false intelligence, hewas nnniedi6tely to be put so death..' Tile bald robber readily agreed to the♦conditions ; and having disguised himself,he proceeded to the city. He arrived thereabout dav-break, and found the cobblerMusiapba in his stall, which was alwaysopen beiore any shop in the town.“ Good morrow^ friend,” said the rob-toer, as he passed the stall, “ you rise be-times: I should think, old as you are, your‘ could scarely see to work fcy this light”‘Indeed, sir,” replied the eobler, “old10<‘as I am, I do not want for good eye-sight;“ as you must needs believe, when 1 tell“ you I sewed a dead body together the“ otiier day, where I had not so good a“ light as 1 have now.”“ A dead bod) !” exclaimed the robber,“you mean, I suppose, that you sewed up“the winding sheet for a dead body.”“ i mean no such thing,' replied Musta-“ pha, I tell you 1 sewed the four quarters** of a man together.”Tins was enough to convince the robberhe had luckily met with the very man whocould give him the information he was insearch of. However he did not wish to ap¬pear eager to learn the particulars, lest heshould alarm the old cobier. He thereforebegan to laugh : “ Ha, ha !” said he, “I“ find, good Mr Cobier, that you perceive“ I am a stranger here, and you wish to“ make me believe that the people of your“ city do impossible things.”“ 1 tell you,” said Mustapha, in a loudand angry tone, “ I sewed a dead body to¬gether with my own hands.”“ Then 1 suppose you can tell me also“ Where you performed this wonderful bus-“ iness ?”Upon this, Mustapha related every par¬ticular of his being led blindfold to thehouse, &c.“ Well, my friend,” said the robber, “ ’tis“ a fine story, I confess, blit not very easy11,:'to belie ve : tiowever, if you will convince!“ me by shewing • -be house you talk of,“I will giv vou nieces of gold to|*‘make amends far :y unOe^ief.,,“ I think,” s;ud the cobler -;fter consi-Idering awhile, “ that it you '-vere to blind-“ fold me, I should ren ’n<l: ■ every turn-ling yve made, but with m eyes open Iam sure I should never find it.”Accordingly the robber covered Musta-pha’s eyes with his handkerchief, vho ledhim through most of the principal streets,flSand stopping by Casim’s door, said. “ Here“it is I went no farther than this house.'”The robber immediately mark- ■ the door.with a piece of chalk, and givi' g d • pstaphabis four pieces of gold, dismissed him.I Shortly after the thief and Mustapha hadojuited the door, Morgiana coming homefrom market, perceived the little mark ofIvhin chalk on the door, and suspectingmomething was wrong, directly marked fourdoors on one side, and five on the other ofler master’s, in exactly the same manner,iithout saying a woi*l to any one,The robber meantime rejoined his troop,!|jnd boasted greatly of his success. His cap-Igin and comrades praised his diligence,id being well armed, they proceeded tole town in different disguises, and in se-irate parties of three and four together.i was agreed among tnem,. that they were> inget in the.market place at the dusk ofevening; and that the captain and the robber■who had discovered*the nouse, were to gothere first, to finii out to whom'it belonged, !Accordingly, being arrived in the street, andhaving a lantern with them, they began toexamine the doors, and found, to their con¬fusion and astonishment, thrt ten doorswrere marked exactly alike. The robberwho- was the captains guide could not say ione word in explanation of his mystery ;and u'hen the disappointed troop got back sto the forest, his enraged companions or- 1dered him to be put to death.Another now offered himself upon the 1same conditions as the former; and havingbribed Mustapha, and discovered the househe made a mark with dark red chalk uponthe door, in a part tba. was not in the least :conspicuous: and carefully examined thesurrounding doors, to be certain that nosuch mark was upon any one of them.But nothing could escap1* the prying eyes iof Morgiana : scarcely had tne robbers de- 1parted when she discovered the red mark; rand getting some red eiialk, she markedseven doors on each side precisely in the |same place, and in the same manner.The robber, valuing himself highly uponthe precautions he had taken, triumphantlyconducted his captain to the spot: but greatindeed was his contusion ami dismay, w henhe found it impossible to say which, among t,fifteen houses marked es&etly alike, w<m *13the right one. The captain, furious withhis disappointment, returned again withthe troop to the forest: and Use second roj)-oer was also condemned to death.The captain having thus lost two of histroop, judged that their hands were more. active than their heads in such services ; andlie resolved to employ no other of them,out to go himself upon the business.Accordingly he repaired to the city, andiddressed himself to the cobbler Mustapha;?ho, for six pieces of gold, readily perrorm-d the same sevoces for him he had donelor the two other strangers : and the cap-lain, much wiser than 1 is mei', did notjimuse himself with setting a mark upon theper, but attentively considered the house,iloui-ted the number of its widows, and pas¬sed by it very often to be certain that heiifhould know it again.t| He then returned to the forest, and or-ered his troop to go into the town, anduy nineteen mules and thirty-eight largers, one full of oil, and the rest empty.In two or three days the jars were brought,ml ail things in readiness, and the captainaving put a man into each jar, properlyrmed, the jars being rubbed on the outside’ith oil, and the covers having holes bored) them for the men to breathe through,aded his mules, and in the habit of an oil-erchant. entered the town m the dusk ofe evening. He proceeded t.o the street1.5an oil-jar, woukl have screamed out, butthe prudent .Morgiana instantly recollectedherself, and replied softly, ’‘No, not yet, klie still till I call you.” She passed on togvery jar, receiving the same question, a1 d 'making the same answer, till she canre tothe last, which was really filled with oil.Morgiana was now convinced that thiswas a plot of the robbers to murder her !master Ali Baba, so she ran back to the ;kitchen, and brought out a large kettle, i■which she filled with oil, and set it on agreat wood fire, and as soon as it boiled, shewTent and poured into the jars sufficient of tithe boiling oil to kill every man within ithem.Having done this, she put out her lire,and her lamp, and crept softly to her'cham- t*ber.The captain of the robbers, bearing every 1thing quiet in the house, and perceiving no ■light any where, arose, and went down into iithe vard to assemble his men. Coming tothe first jar, he felt the steams of the boiled ;oil, ae ran lustily to the rest, and foundevery one of Ins troop put to death in thesame manner. Full of rage and despair at .thaving failed in his design, he forced the ■:lock of a doo" that Jed to the garden, and imade his escape over the walls.On the following morning, Morgiana re- «ilated to her ir istei Ali Baba bis wonderful ideliverance from the pretended oil mei-'r~H-14llierc AH Baba dwelt, and found him sit¬ing in the porch of his house. “ Sir,ijtid he to AH Baba, “ I have brought this(oil a great way to sell, and-am too latefor this day’s market. As 1 am quite aif stranger in this town, will you do me thefavour to let me put my mules into’ yourcourt-yard, and direct me where I maylodge '.o night.”Ali Baba who was a good natured man,elqom?d the pretended oil merchant verymdly, ami offered'him a bed in bis ownpuse, and having ordered the mules to bepleaded in the yard, and properly fed, het vited his guest into supper. The captain,jiving seen the jars placed ready in thein], followed AH Baba into the house, andifter supper was shewn to the chamberihere he was to sleep.Jlli happened that Morgiana was obligedi| sit up later that night than usual, to getnady her master’s bathing linen for the fol¬lowing morning, and while she was busy a-;j|)ut the fire, her lamp went out, and thereIis no more *>il in the house.After considering what she could possi-jy do for a light, siie recollected the thirtyght oil-jars in the yard, and determinedtake a little oil out of one of them for;r lamp. She took her oil-pot in her hand.Id anproaching the first jar, the robberithin said, “ Is it time, captain ?” Anyher slave, perhaps,, on hecring a man in1Gchant and his "ang of robbers, Ali Babat first could scarcely credit her tale ; Duwhen he saw the robbers dead in the jarshe could not sufficiently praise her couragj jand sagacity, and without letting any on«else into the secret, he and Morgu na, th4next night, buried the thirty-seven thieveiin a deep trench at the bottom of the gar|den. The jars and the^mdes, as he haol.no use for them, were %ent from time t<time to the different markets, and sold.While Ali Baba took these measures t(prevent his and Cassini’s adventures m tb .forest from beh g known, the captain returned to his c.ive, and for some time abandomd himse.i' to grief and despair. A .length however he determined to adcp\ 5new scheme for tlie destruction of Ali Baba?H? removed by degrees ail the valuablemerchandise from the cave to the city, andtook a shop exactly opposite to Ali Babalhouse.fie furnished this shop with every ihin£that was rare and costly, and v ent by thiname of' the merchant Cogia Hassan. Man),persons made acquaintance with the stran.ger. among others, Ali Baba’s son wentevery flay to his shop. I he pretended,Cogia Hassan soon appeared to be verjj ,'fond of Ali Baba’s son, offered him manypresents, and often detained him to dinneron which occasions he treated him in- thehandsomest manner./• AAli Baba*s son thought it was necessary!; to make some return to these civilities, andI pressed his father to invite Cogia Hassen toI supper. Ali Baba made no objection, and■{ the invitation was accordingly given.The artful Cogia Hassan would not too1 hastily accept this invitation, but pretendedd he was not fond of going into company, and■ 1 that he had business which demanded hispresence at home. These excuses onlymade Ali Baba’s son the more eager to takei him to his father’s house ; and after repeat-I ed solicitations, the merchant consented to] sup at Ali Baba’s the next evening.A most excellent supper was provided,i which Morgiana cooked in the best man-'I ner, and, as was her usual custom, she car-■ ried jn the first dish herself. The moments she looked at Cogia Hassan, she knew himto be the pretended oil-merchant. theprudent Morgiana did not say a word tof any one of this Miscovery, but sent thei other slave into the kitcnen, and waited atstable herself; and while Cogia Hassan wasI drinking, she perceived he had a dagger• dl’.id under his coat. When supper was end-fed, and the desert and wine on the table,jMoigiana went away and dressed herself in[ the habit of a dancing girl: she next calledAbdalla, a fellow slave, to nlay on his tabor(while she danced.!As soon as she appeared at the parlour-door, her master, who was very fond ofo 18seeing her dance, ordered her to come into entertain his guest with some of her 'bestdancing. Cogia Hassan was not very well |satisfied with this entertainment, yet was#compelled, for fear of discovering himself, |to seem pleased with the dancing, while infact he wished Morgiana a great way off,;and was quite alarmed, lest he should lose hisopportunity ofmurderingAliBabaand his son.Moigiana danced several dances with thejutmost grace and agility, and then drawinga poinard from her girdle, she performedmany surprising things with it, eometimespresenting the point to one, and sometimesto another, and then seemed to strike it inito her own bosom. Suddenly she paused,and holding the poinard in the right hand,presented her left to her master, as if beg¬ging some money, upon which Ali Baba anchis son each gave her a small piece 011money. She then turned to the pretendedCogia Hassan, and wh> he was putting his;hand into his purse, she plunged the poinarcinto his heart.“Wretch!” cried Ali Baba, ‘'thou has t“ruined me and my family.”“No, Sir,” replied Morgiana, “I hav*“preserved, and not ruined, you and you“son. Look well at this traitor, and yor“will find him to be the pretended oil“ merchant who came once before to rof« and murder you.” JAli Baba, having pulled oft* the turbaiP _ 7 <..19and the cloak which the false Cogia Hassanwore, discovered that he jVsfe not only thepretended oil-merchant, but the captain ofthe forty robbers, who had slain his brotherCassini; nor would he doubt that his perfi¬dious aim had been to destroy him, andprobably his son, with the concealed dag-ger.Ali Baba, who felt the new obligation heowned to Morgiana for thus saving his life a. second time, embraced me, and said, “My“ dear Morgiana, I give you your liberty;“ but my gratitude must not stop there; II1 “will also marry you to my son, who can1 “ esteen ar-d admire you no less than; “ does his father.” Then turning to hisIson, he added, “^ou, my son, will not re-“ fuse the wife 1 offer ; for, in marrying“Morgiana, you take to wife the preserver“and benefactor of yourself and family.”I The son, far from shewing and dislike,ireadily and joyful accepted his proposed't fbride, having long entertained an affectionfor the good slave Morgiana.Having rejoiced in their deliverance, theyjuried the captain that night with great priva¬cy, in the trench, along with his troop of rob-•1 )ers; and a few days afterwards, Ali Baba cel-ibrated the marriage of his son and MorgianaIvith a sumptuous entertainment; and everyme who knew Morgiana, said she was worthyt her good fortune, and highly commended|er master’s generosity toward her.IfL•120During a twelvemonth All Baba forboreto go near the forest, but at Vngth his cu-riosny incited him to make another journey*When he came to the cave, he saw no foot¬steps of either men or Imrses; and havingsaid, Open, Sesame, he went in, end judgedby the state of things deposited in the ca¬vern, that no one had been there since thepretended Cogia Hassan had removed theimerchandise to his shop in the city. AliBaba took as much gold home as his horse'could carry; an i afterwards he carried his,]son to the cave, and taught him the secret.]The secret they handed down to their poTsterity ; and using their good fortune witmoderation, they lived in honour and splendour, and served with dignity some of thehighest offices of the city.1;ijALEXANDER AND DAftIUS.^XlThen Alexander the Great, king of Ma-T cedon.^nvaded Persia, Darius, who wa?kitig thereof, opposed him with - a very-e great army, consisting according to the low¬est account, of 200,000 men. The man-mer of his coming on, was rather like a mas¬ter than a warrior, and like one that tookimore care to set out his riches, than to pro.i vide for his own safety, persuading himself,as it seemed, to beat Alexander with pompand sumptuous pageants. For before thearmy.was carried the holy fire, which the‘Persians worshipped, attended by theirpriests, and after them 365 young men, ac¬cording to the number of the days of theyear, covered with scarlet, then the chariottof Jupiter drawn by white horses, their ri¬ders clothed in the same colour, with rods?of gold in their hands, and after it t|ie horsebf the sun : next, after these followed tensumptuous chariots inlaid and garnished4twith silver and gold, and then the vanguardof their horse, compounded of twelve seve¬ral nations, which (the better to avoid con¬fusion) did hardly understand each other'slanguage : and these, marshalled at the headof the rest, being beaten, might serve veryfitly to disorder ad that followed them. Atthe tail of these horses marched the regi¬ment of foot the Persians call immortal, be*because if any died, the number was present-ly supplied, and these were armed vvitlachains of gold, and their coats embroideredjwith the same metal, whereof the sleeveJwere garnished with pearl, bj^ts either t<f [tempt the hungry Macedonians withal, otto persuade them that it were great jncivili jty to cut and deface so glorious garments.To second this court-like company j15,000 were appointed, more rich and glit ktering than the former, but appareled iik iwomen, (to breed the more ierror,) am :ithese were honoured with the title of th fking’s kinsmen. Then came Darius hiir iself, the gentlemen of his wardrobe ridin '$before liis chariot, which was supported b;;the gods of the nation, cast and cut in pur ugold. The head of his chariot was set witl bprecibHs. stones, and two little golden idols t«covered with an open-winged eagle of th £same metal, the hinder part being raiseshigh, tv hereon Darius sat, had a covering cinestimable value. This chariot of the km (was followed by 10,Q00 horsemen, their latif23i ces plated with silver, and their heads gilt,,! which they meant not to embrue in the Ma-; cedonian blood for fear of marring their: beauty. He had for tin proper guard ofibis own person 200 of the blood royal,i blood too royal anu precious to be spilt by4 any valorous adventurer, (I am of opinion!200 sturdy fellows like the Switzers, wouldshave done him more service.) and thesewere backed with 30,000 footmen, afterwhom again were led 400 spare horses forit he king, which if he had meant to have>used, lie would have marshalled somewhatinearer4|^.Now^rnlowed the rear guard, the samebeing led by Sisagambis the king’s mother,sand by his wife, drawn in a glorious chariot,followed by a great train of ladies on horse-jback, with 15 waggons of the king’s chil¬dren and the wives of the nobility, waitedion by 250 concubines, and a world of nur¬ses and eunhchs most sumptuously appareled,i by which it should seem that Darius thoughtthat the Macedonians had been a companyfof comedians or tumblers ; for this troopwas far fitter to behold those sports than to5tbe present at battles. Between these and a(company of light armed slaves was theicing’s treasure, on 600 mules and 300 ca.mels, brought, as it proved, to pay the Ma¬cedonians. In this sort came the May-gamei cing into the field, encumbered with a mostpnecessary train of strumpets, attended2L24with troops of divers nations, speaking dvers languages, and for their numbers intpossible to be marshalled, and for the mospart go effeminate, so rich in gold and iSgarments, as the same could not but hav^encouraged the raggedest nation in thWorld against them.The event was, tliat Darins was utterifoverthrown, his treasure lost, his wife, m^ther and children taken prisoners, and a|the train of ladies spoiled of their rich gaments and jewels. It is true, that both tlqueen, and her daughters, who had thgood hap to be brought to Jm^andeifpresence, were entertained with arT the repect due to their birth, their honours prfserved, and their jewels and rich gar menrestored again unto them : and though 0ruts' wife was a very beautiful lady, and hdaughters of excellent form, yet Alexandimastered his affhcltion towards them. * ?Darius himself, leaving his brother deaiwith divers others of his chief captaincasting the crown from his head, hardescaped.FINIS.lj

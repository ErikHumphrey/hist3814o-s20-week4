Provifions beingfcarce on the Englifh fide in thoie borders,this report made his men fo forward, thatthey defired they might go out in parties,and bring as much as they could get awayundifeovered; but he.oefpifing fuch a waythat locked too much like dter-flealing,told them, if their courage was fufficientto venture for it fairly, he would venturewith them ; and fo hunting it d. wr, asa fair game, it ihould be brought ft'withhonour, as a lawful prize, taken in an.enemy’s country : For then K. Henry II.of England, in whHe reign it happened,: was at war with the Sc^ts, tho’ there hadbeen, for a while, an interval, or reflationof arms. To this motion of the nobleEarl’s, they gave their unanimous con^( 4 )fen'c, by throwing up their caps, witha loud fhout. And fo toe Eul madea vow, that f >r three days he w Id t ikehis p>eafare in hunting in Ghevyciiafe.And, thereupon, fending for his dugs' mdtoils, er.rly on a midfummer morning,they pi (Ted the Tweed; and were bys guide directed to the place, which wasabout hx miles nearer Edinburgh.So to the game they went; the dogswere put fn to r mfe the h^rts ; the hornsfounding, the huntfmen’s liiouts, with ithe nsife < f th.e d gs, alarmed all thecountry round. The villagers thinkingit had been the f und of w,*r, or fome ffudden invafion, were fo terrified, thatm»ny of them fled with what they couldcarry away, for fear of being plundered;!and with their groundlefs fears put thejwhole neighbourhood, idf many miles,Jint'» conllernation and confufion !The harts and roes, tho’ fwift in theiryunning, could not. however, outftrip theEnglilh archers, they laying Tme fcoresof them on the ground. They killed foimany, that they knew not how to getthem carried vfF; fueh was their fuccefsin hunting the firll day. At night, theykindled great fires, and roafted the fitfid.:-- and haunches; with which theyrefrellisd themfelves.But, wh'ilft the Earl was at fupper-j-W'ith clivers Knights. ’Squires sr.d Gen¬tlemen, on a table of beards laid on fup-] porters of turf, and fating on feats railedion a turf bank, Inch accommodation asj1 the rural place could siT rd-; at the doleI of it, and juft: as he was about to giveI orders to thehuhtfmen to begin the fportthe next morning with the fun-riling,jin came a meftenger drefled in Icarlet| livery, laced with gold, and a badge ofH arms on a plate of liiver, fallened on hisIbrealt; which fnewed him to be fert b)rfonte perfon of quality. Whereupon,the Eari commanding ftience, demandedfrom whence he came, and what hisi: bufnefs v/as. Upon which he thusbegan, with a haughty mein :“ Sir,” faid he, “ whoever you areI know not, but my Mailer, the noble, va¬liant, and always vift rieus Earl Douglas,chief Ranger to the King of Scotland, andto whom ihefe Parks and Ghafes belong,hearing you have boldly prefumed toenter them, and deiiroy his deer, withoutleave or confent, by me tells you, tha:if yon do not fuddenly depart, your livesfhall pay for the injury you 'have dtr.e,before tc-morrow noon 1”( 6 )Thh beting denounced, he was ab utto depart; but the undaunted EarlPiercy,taking him by thefleeve, faid,“ Sir, It is proper ynu fluuld carryan anfwer back to your L 'rd ; and thatis this: Tell him my name is Piercy;a name at which Scotland has trembled!and that I am of lb true Engiilh courage,that threats are in vain to terrify me.—Tell him, moreover, I have propofed totake my pleafure in thefe Ph-refts andChafes f r two days longer; and if liebe fo valiant as you fay, let him hindermy fport, if he be fo bold as to attempt it,at the hazard of his life.”Upon this, the mtHunger departedwith fpeed to the Scotch Earl, who layat Edinburgh, and related what wasgiven him in charge by Earl Piercy :At which the Scotch Earl raged, walkingup and down, threatening all mannerof punifhments on thofe he fhould takeprisoners ; and enqsired particularly thenumber of the Englifh, but the mefienger,could give him no certain account, onlygueff.d there might be about ten or twelvehundred men, for many cf them were indillant parts of the foreft, when he deli¬vered his melTage.Whereupcn he (itdered his horfe andfarmour (which were overlaid with gold)| to be get ready aga'mft morning light;! alio all his friends and lervants, together' with as many as made up two thu-ufandIfpearmen, to be muftered without letting| them know what defign he had in hand.I However, they difputed not to ' bey him,having, next the King, the chief com-i mand of the kingdom.The Earl of Northumberland, tho’ ini an enemy’s country, and far from anyfuccour, yet relying on his own and the! courage cf his men (the choiceft archers! of England) was fo far from being daunted,I tho’ he might re*aIonably expeft a greaternumber againfthim,he ordered the tablesto be fpread a fecond time, and ftore ofwine went round, which they had broughtwith them in great plenty. Healths wentround, to the King, the Earl, and to theprofperity (f their fport the next day];and then, felting fcouts for their protec¬tion thro’ the night, repefed themfelves.The fun no focner gilded the horizonwith his rays, and the early lark mountedon high, tuned her melodious mtes, thanthe fpert was renewed; and the woods,foreft, plains and hills, refounded withthe pleafing n'oife of hounds, fo that, al¬together, they mad: a curious harnu r.y ’( 8 )This ffi rh’rg they killed a very ftatelyhart, th(f larjjeft that had been feen inthe.^kuigdomJ Whereupon the htmtfmnnran'to call the Karl, that he might feethe charming creature ; and he declaredhe had never feen any fo large.Karl Piercy remembering the mefTagefent him the former night, he turned toa Knight on his left hand, faying, “ Thetime, Sir Knight, draws near, that, ifEarl Douglas keeps his word, we ihatlhave another kind of fpcrt to undertake ;he promifed this morning to make usa vific, theref re let it be your care tokeep our men together, left fome of thembe furprifed; for, man to man, faid he,1 fear them not. But, if I thought hev/ould not come, we would remove henceto the next foreil; T>r thither, I perceive,molt of the deer, frighted fr^m this fureft,are fled.” He had no fooner uttered thefewords, than one of his ’Squires, calledWitherington, came baddy to him, fay¬ing, “ My poble Lord, caufe the dogsbe immediately called off, and mufter upyour bold archers ; for from yonder hillI faw Earl Douglas coining dire£l!y to¬wards you, though yet above two milesdiftant, having a great troop of fpearmen,which I guefs n t lefs than two thoufand.”“ I thank thee heartily,” replied the Earl,( 9 )“ for this news; and doubt not thy cou-| rage, which I have feen tried in to manydangers.” At this, the ’Squire bowinglow, laid, “ My Lord, I doubt not 16 tobehave ravfelf this day, that living cri dead, I fhali be worthy of your efleem.”' In.-mediately hereupon the horns blewa retreat, the d gs were Cilied eft, the11 toils taken up, and the valiant archersnl idle red about their noble leader, whofired their courage with the followingoration : “ My renowned countrymen,and fellows in arms, always victoriousin battle, Hill triumphing in the fpeib ofour enemies; it was with your confect:we psibd the Tweed for fport and re¬creation, but that is fuddenly like to bediflurbed, and we have another work toi undertake. Karl D. uglas, who owns: this Chaie and forsfl, has lent me a chal¬lenge, and is now going to give us battle,i or fhamefully to make us fly over theTweed ; Pull up your fpirits then, andconfider you are EngHflimen; that Piercrfights at ycur head, rvho never, eitherin France or Scotland, feared the Uce«f any. Pje cour?gious then, and forthe honour of our King, the renown ofi cur country, living or dying rue, you: may pain a taflirg fame and memory,that fliall not tnd but with time itfell.( 1° )and gain you renown, to all p .fterity.”—Having thus faid, they ail lliouted faloud, in t ’ken of confent and lively cou¬rage, that the hills and dales fent backthe echoes of their voice, and immedi¬ately fell into order, prunning theirarrows, and {fringing their bows, madecf trufty yew.The -EngliOi archers (in number aboutfifteen hundred) were no fooner in readi-nefs, than Earl Douglas appeared on thetop ef the hill that descended into the plainupon which Piercy ifoed, mounted on a{lately white Iked, his gilded armourrefilling with the fun-beams, and hismen, in order, behind him, with theirglittering fpears! Their number "wascomputed about two thoufand. Uponthis, Piercy took a leading llaff in hiehand, and a trully fword by his fide, andcaufed his men m ve forward by ft wpaces, whiUl he marched in the front.—By this time D <ugias being come withinfirthv paces, fternly demanded wholemen they were, that durft fo boldiy pre¬fume to hunt in his Ureft, and kill hisdeer? That wh ever they were, fmeethey had dared to do it, they mufl expettto be feverely puniHied; commandingthem to yield immediately as his prifm-ers, if they expefled mercy from him.( II )Piekcy, enr&ged with a generous fury,ordered his men to halt; and drawingnearer, faid, “ lilarl Douglas, it mattersn < v.'hofe men we are, but fuch you willfind us, that what we nave done we v/illjuftify ; and what deer we have killed,we will carry away, or leave our ownbodies dead behind us, which will coilvery dear in the blood of thofe that dareopp.fe us.” This being fpokeu with anundaunted refolution, made Douglas growa little calmer: “ O, laid he, I knowthee now, Lord Piercy ! thou art a Peer,an Earl, hs well as I; therefore, if thouart as brave as fame report thee, whatneed we deflroy our men, by engagingthem in this combat; the quorrel beingproperly between you and me ; let ourfwords decide it.” This unexpeftedcfFer overjoyed Piercy ! who, drawinghis victorious iword, bkl defiance to thechallenger. But u could not be. fate hadinvolved many more lives in this quarrelthan the two Earls; f.r Witherington,a valiant EngUfl) ’Squire, (landing bythe Earl, when thii combat was aboutto begin, clapt between them with hisfword, and made a Hand, Lyi ng, “ Mynoble Lord, it fhall never be told Henryour King, that we let you fight, whililwe Hood looking cn. Hnv flv uld we( 12 )be rep'- *cbed with cowardice, if thiswas fuff-Tid or known! With hearts andhands we are read’/ to live or die in yourcaufe; and, therefore, whilft I am ableto iicnd, more fwords than one fiiall thisencounter.'’ Piercy, th ugh grieved atthis hindrance, feeing all his men refo-lute, and of the fame opinion, found him-felf c mftrained to yield to their impor¬tunities ; and fo both Tides were orderedto make ready for battle.The Eaglifn archers on the left divilimimmediately lent a flight of fatal arrows,which Inhl threefcore of the Scots deadon the place! And the right divifion let¬ting fly on the flank of their bsttalion,gauled them mofl miferably. Douglasfeeing his men difcouraged, by beingkilled fo at a diftance, and that anothervolley might put them into diforder,commanded them fpeedily to advance,and come to a dole fight; by whichmeans he thought to render the -Englishbows (which was their chief weapons)ufelefs: but in this he was deceived;for they kept fuch excellent order, thatwhenever the front opened, the archersbehind feathered the Scots with Ihoweroof deadly arraws, whilfl the others keptthem in play with tneir IworJs. How¬ever, both being furious, they f ug: t.( J3 )j| defperately, infomuch thst the groundj was c vered with dead and woundedmen, arrows, fnieves of fpears, brokenfw. rds, and ftreams of blood ; nothingwas heard but confufed noife, groans| and cries! And n-w Earl Piercy beingbacked by divers Knights and ’Squires,men at arms, and other weapons, cut offthe tops f-f the enemies’ fpears, pointedagainft him, and, like a tempeft, brokein amongll them with fuch fury andfhughter, that he laid heaps of dead eneither hand, and before him, fo that hewas, in a manner, flopped with the car-cafes of the flain; which railed a great cryabout him, infomuch that Earl Douglas,who was fighting on the other fide, andhad fignalized his valour very much, wasforced to give over, and come to the fuc-cour of his broken forces. Piercy andDouglas met like two enraged lions!No armour was proof againfl their well-tempered fwords, fo that by the mightyftr. kes they gave each other, the placethey fought on, was fprinkled with theirnoble blood ! D uglas beginning to faint,yet afktimed to yield, thus fp -ke to Piercy,Noble Lord, y'-m fee your bio; d flwsfaft, and death you cannot efcape, if youContend with me much longer; I there¬fore, in pity to you, would have you yield'L- - '.c.( 14 )yourfelf niv prifoner: Y in fhill be n. >blynfed, and I’ll prefent y-nj to Jirnes, ourKing, as one of worth and courage.”—To this Piercy replied, “ As for my lifetake you no care, but furely guard yourown; my honour I prefer before all thingson earth ; and it never {hall be faid, thatPiercy yielded to a Scot.” While theywere thus converfmg, an arrow from thearchers ended the combat, by piercingDouglas to the heart; who thereuponfell to the ground. His laft words were,“ Fight on, my msrrv men; revengemy death, for I am fliin, and Piercylives to fee me fall 1”Piercv was much afFe&ed with hisdeath, and endeavoured to raise him fromthe grjund, and much commending hisvalour. But, while he was thus lament¬ing his death, Sir Hugh Montgomery,Diuglas’ chief favourite, broke throughthe rank, and run him through the body,so that he fell on D mglas, having onlytime to encourage his men, and so gaveup the ghost. But his death was n fDng unrevenged, for an knglilh arrowpatTed thro’ M mtg>mery’s body, so thatthe feathers of the arrows were wet inhis heart’s blood. Thus fell thefe twogreat chieftsios, the glory of Englandand Scotland!( T5 )Bat though the chiefs were flain, thebattle continued with great fury, eitherfide fcorning to yield, though the fundeclined, having continued almoft a wholefummer’s day. Few were left alive, andthofe who remained were fo wounded andwearied, that they were conlhained todepart by ccnfent.Witherington efpecially diftinguifliedhimfelf in this s&ton, as he had promifed,till a Scot, coming behind him with mbroad {word, cut cff his legs! But heraifed himfeit cn his bleeding flumpswvlth his hajtids, and pierced his enemy!But, thro' iofs of blood he focn expired.Of the Scots there remained but 55;and of the Englifh only 53 !!!The f.'ll'wihg Ballad was comp.fedon the occafion ; which gives the Spotc^account of that memorable trar.fauVion,!'( )THEHUNTING OF CHEVYCHASE.An Ancient Heroic Ballad.A -LL happinefs attend our King,our nation, one and ail:A woeful hunting once there didin Chevycbafe befai1To drive the deer with hound and horn,Earl P;ercy took his way,The child may rue, that was unborn,the hunting of that day.Vhe flout Esrl bf Northumberlanda foletnn vow did make,His pk'ifure, in the Scottiih woods,three fummer’s days to take.The ehoiccll harts of Chevychafeto kill and bear away.Thefe tidings to Earl D mglas came,in Scotland w’nere he lay ;Who lent Earl Ptercy .prefent v/ord,he would prevent his fport.The Englifh Ear!, n t fearing him,did to the wood refort.With twenty hundred b w-men bold,all chofeii men of might.( i7 )Who knew full well, in time of need,to aim their fhafts aright.The gallant grey hounds fwiftly ran,t chafe the fallow-deer :On Monday they began to hunt,when day-light did appear;And long before high noon they hadan hundred fat bucks flain !Then, having din'd, the rovers wentto roufe them up agiin.The bow-men mufter’d on thehili,v/ell able to endure:Thoir backfides all, with fpecial care,that day were guarded hire.The hounds ran fwiftly thro’ the woodthe nimble deer to take ;And with their cries the hills and dalesan echo fhrill did make.Earl Piercy to the quarry went,to view the fallow-deer ;Quoth he, Earl Douglas promifedthis day to meet me here :But if { thought he would not come,no t nger would 1 Hay.With that * brave young gentlemanthus'to the Earl did fay,.X.o ! yonder doth E'.rd D uglas come ”his.men in armour bright!{ i8 )Full fifteen hundred Scottifh fpears,'all marching in our fight!All valiant men of Tiviotdale*come from the river Tweed.Then ceafe your fports, Earl Piercy faid,and take your bovrs with fpeed tAnd go with me, my countrymen,yur coourage to advance ;For there was ne’er a champion yet,in Scotland or in France,That ever did on horfe-back come,bat, if my hap it were,I durit encounter man for man,with him to break/3 fpear.Lord DmgPis, on a milk-white Heed,mofi; like a baron bold,Rode foremofi: of the company,whofe armour flione like g»ld !Shew me, faid he, whofe men ye be,that hunt fo boldly here,That, without my confent, do chafeand kill my fallow-deer ?The firfl man that did anfwer make,was noble Piercy he.Who faid, We lifi not to dechre,and fhow whofe men we be :Yet we will fpend rur dearell blood,the choice ft harts to fiay.( 19 )Then Douglas-fwore a foiemn oath,and thus, in rage, did fay :Ere thus I will outbraved be,one of us two fhall die !I know thee well, an Earl thou art.Lord Piercy, fo am 11But truft me, Piercy, pity it were,and great offence, to killAny cf thefe cur harmlefs men,for they have done no ill:Let me and thee the battle trv,■* *and fet cur men afide.Accurft be he, faid Earl Piercy,by whom this is deny’d.^Then ftept a gallant Efqutre forth,call’d Withrington by name.Who faid, I wruld not have it toldto Henry, my king, for fhame,| That e’er my Captain fought cn foot,and I flood looking on.You be two Earls, faid Withringtcn,and I a ’Squire alone,I’ll do the belt that I may da,while I have power to fiand ;Whild I have power to weild my fwcrd,I’ll fight with heart and hand.Our Scottifh archers bent their bows,their hearts were good and true:I( 2® )At the firfi flight of arrows bent,they fourfcore Englifh flew !To drive the deer with hound and horn5Douglas bad on the bent:A Captain, mov’d wi’ meikle pride,the fpears in fhivers went!They clos’d full fall on every fide,no flacknefs there was fot nd ;And many a gallant gentlemanlay gafping on the ground !O ! but it was a grief to fee,and likewife for to hear,The cries cf men lying in their gore,all fcattered here and there !At laft thir two fteut Earls did meet,like chieftains of great might.Like lions mov’d, they fear’d no lord,they made a cruel fight!They fought until they both did fvveat,with fwords of temper’d fleel,Until the blood, like drops of rain,they trinkiing down did feel.Yield thee L rd Piercy, Douglas faid,In faith I will thee bringWhere.thou Ihalt high advanced beby Junes our Scbttifh king:Thy ranfom I will freely give,and this report -of thee,I 21 )Thou art the moft cnuragicus Knightthat ever I did fee.No, Douglas, quoth Lord Picrcy then,thv pr-:f:er I d fcorn ;I will not yield to any Scotthat ever yet was born.With that there carae an arrow keenout of an Englifh bow.Which ftruck Lord Douglas to the heart,« deeo and deadly blow !Who never fpeke more words than t'hefe,“ Fight on, my merry men all;For why, my life is at an end,L rd Piercy fees me fall!”Then, leaving life, Lord Piercy tookLcrd D mgias by the hand,And faid, *• Alzs!

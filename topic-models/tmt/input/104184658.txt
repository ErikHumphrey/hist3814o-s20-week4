|But when will it bring such music to me.As the voice o’ my ain handsome Charlie.The tears steal gently down frae my een,[Nae dangers on earth then could fear me :My heart throbbing beat and I heav’d up a sigh,When the lad that I lov'd was near me.Fu’ trig wi” his bonny bonnet sae blue,And his tartan dress sae rarely;A heart that was leal and to me ever true,Was aye in the breast of my Charlie.His lang quartered shoon, and his buckles sae clear.On his shoulder was knotted the plaidie ;Naething on earth was to me half sae dear,As a sight of my ain Highland laddie.Red was his cheeks and flaxen his hair,Hanging down on his shoulders sae rarely ;A blink o' his ee wi’ a smile banish’d care,Sae handsome then was my Charlie.My laddie, ohon was the flower o’ them a’.For the loss of my mate I am eerie }For when that the pibroch began for to blaw,*1 was then that I lost my dearie.But waes me alas, wi’ their slaughter and war,’Iwas then that he gaed awa fairly ;And broad is the sea now that parts me afar,Frae the love o’ my ain handsome Charlie.Ance my hours wi’ pleasure was blest,But now they are dull and eerie ;6And when on slumber’s sofi billows I rest,I behold the sweet shade of my dearie.But as long as I live and a- long as I breath,I will sing to his memory rarely.Till love is united-by the arrows of death,O Flora shall mourn for her Charlie.’Twas summer and sweetly the breeses were blow*ing,And sweetly the nightingale sung from the tree ;At the foot of a rock where the r ver was flowing,J set myself down on the banks of the D jcFiow on lovely Dee. flow on thou sweet riverThy banks purest stream shall be dear to me ever,For there I fi st gained the affection and fav mrOf Jamie the pride and the flower of the Dee.But now he’s gone from me and left me thus mourn*ingTo quell the proud rebels for valiant is he.And ah there’s no hope of his speedy returning,To wander again on the banks of the Dee.He’s gone, hapless youth, o'er the loud roaring bil*lows,The kindest and sweetes of all the gay fellows.And left me to stra ’mong’st these once loved wil¬lows.The lonliest maid o» the banks of the Dee.THE BANKS OF THE DEE.7But time and my prayers may perhaps yet restorehim,Blest peace may restore my dear shepherd to me,And when he returns with such care I’ll watch o’erhim,He never shall leave the sweet banks of the Dee.The Dee then s^al1 flow, all it's beauties displaying.The lambs on its banks shall again be seen playing,While I with my Jamie am catlessly straying.And tasting again all the sweets of the Dee.GO PLAINTIVE SOUNDS.Go plaintive sounds! and to the fair,My secret wounds icnpait,Tell ail I hope, tell ail I fear,Each motion in my heart.But she methinks is lisi’ning now,To some enchanting strain,The smile that triumphs o er her brow,Seems not to heed my pain.Yes, plaintive sounds, yet, yet delayHowe’er my love repine,Let that gay minute pass away,The next perhaps is thine.Yes, plaintive sounds, no longer crost,Your griefs shall soon be o’er,Her cheek undimpled now has lost,The smile it lately wore.I8Yes, plaintive sounds, she now is yours.'Tis now your time to move;Essoy to soften all her pow’rs,And be that softness, loveCease plaintive sounds, your task is doneThat anxious tender airProves o’er her heart the conquest won,I see you melting there.Return, ye smiles, return again.Return each sprightly grace,I yield up to your charming reign.All that enchanting face.I take no outward shew amiss,Rove where they will, her eyes,Still let her smiles each shepherd bless,So she but hear my sighs.FINIS.

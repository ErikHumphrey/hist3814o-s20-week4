TRAGICAL LOVK8 OFJEMMY AND NANCY OF YARMOUTH.PART I.Shewing how beautiful Nancy of Yarmouth fell in love with youngJemmy the Sailor.*Tune—“ The Yarmouth Tragedy.1'Lovers, I praj, lend an ear to mj story,Take an example by this constant pair ;How love a young virgin did blast in her glory,Beautiful Nancy of Yarmouth we hear.She was a merchant’s only daughter,Heir unto fifteen hundred a-year ;A young man who courted her call’d her his jewel,The son of a gentleman who lived near.Many long years the fair maid he admir’d,When they were infants in love they agreed :And when at age this young couple arriv’d,Cupid an arrow between them display’d.Their tender hearts were linked together—-But when her parents the same they did hear,They to their charming young beautiful daughterActed a part that was hard and severe.4Daughter, they said, give o’er your proceedingIf that against our consent you do wed.For evermore we resolve to disown you,If you wed with one that is so mean bred.Her mother said, you have a great fortune,Besides you are beautiful, charming and youngYou are a match, dear child, that is fittingFor any Lord that is in Christendom.Then did reply the young beautiful virgin,Riches and honours I both do defy.If that I’m denied of my dearest lover,Then farewell, world ! which is all vanity.Jemmy’s the man that I do admire.He is the riches that I do adore ;For to be greater I never desire,My heart is fix’d, never to love more.Then, said her father, ’tis my resolution,Although I have no more daughters but thee.If that with him you resolve for to marry,Banish’d for ever from me thou shalt be.Well, cruel father, but this I desire,Grant me that Jemmy once more I may see.Though you do us part I still will be loyal,For none in the world I admire but he.For the young man he sent in a passion,Saying, for ever, Sir, now take your leave ;I have a match more fit for my daughter,Therefore it is but a folly to grieve.Honoured father, then said the young lady,Promis’d we are by the powers above:Wliy of all comforts will you bereave me,Our love is fix’d never to be remov’d.Then said her father a trip to the ocean,You first shall go in a Ship of my own,And I’ll consent you shall have my daughter.When to Yarmouth again you return.Honoured Sir, then said the two lovers,Since ’tis your will we are bound to obey,Our constant hearts can never be parted,But our eager desires no longer can stay.Then said kind Nancy, behold, dearest Jemmy,Here take this ring, the pledge of our vows,With it my heart, keep it safe in your bosom,Carry it with you wherever you go.Then in his arms he close did enfold her,While chrystal tears like a fountain did flow ;Crying, my heart in return I do give you,And you shall be present wherever I go.When on the ocean, my dear, I am sailing,The thoughts of my jewel the compass shall steer ;These tedious long days speedily time will devour,And bring me home again safe to my dear.Therefore be constant, my dear lovely jewel.For, by the Heavens! if you are untrue,My troubled ghost shall torment you for ever,Dead or alive, I will have none but you.Her lovely arms round his neck then she twined,And saying, my dear, when you are on the seas,If the fates unto us should prove cruel.That we each other no more ever see6No man alive shall ever enjoy me—Soon as the tidings of death reach my ear.Then, like a poor unfortunate lover,Down to the grave I will go to my dear.Then with a sorrowful sigh he departed,The wind next morning blew a pleasant galeAll things being ready, the fam’d Mary Galley,Then for Barbadoes she straightway set sail.PART II.How the Father conveyed a letter to destroy young Jemmy hisdaughter’s sweetheart.Jemmy was floating upon the wide ocean,And her cruel parents were plotting the while,How that the heart of their beautiful daughter,With cursed gold should strive to beguile.Many a Lord of fame, birth, and breeding,Came to court this young beautiful maid ;But their rich presents and proffers she slighted.Constant I’ll be to my jewel, she said.Now for a while we will leave this fair maiden,And tell how things with her did go ;In fair Barbadoes the ship fairly arrived,But now observe this lover’s overthrow.Young Jemmy was comely in every feature,A Barbadoes Lady, whose fortune was great,So fixed her eyes, that she cry’d, if I have notThis brave English sailor, I die for his sake.She dressed herself in gallant attire,Witli costly diamonds she plaited her hair.And a hundred slaves well dressed to attend linr,She sent for this young man to come to her.Come, noble sailor, she cry’d, can you fancyA lady whose riches are very great,A hundred slaves you shall have to attend you,Arid music to charm you in your silent sleep.In robes of gold, my dear, I will deck you,Pearls and rich jewels I’ll lay at your feet,In a chariot of gold you shall ride for your pleasureIf you can fancy me, answer me straight.Amazed with wonder, awhile he stood gazing,Forbear, noble lady, at length he replied,In flourishing England I’ve vow’d to a lady,At my return for to make her my bride. _ " ^ ^ J fy TShe is a charming, young, beautiful creature.She has my heart, and I can love no more ;I bear in my eye her sweet lovely feature,No other creature in earth I’ll adore.Hearing of this she did rave in distraction,Crying, unfortunate maid, thus to loveOne that does basely slight all my glory,And of my person he will not approve.Lords of renown, I their favours have slighted,Now I must die for a sailor so bold:I must not blame him because he is constant.True love, I know, is far better than gold.A costly jewel she instantly gave him,Then in her trembling hand took a knife,One fatal stroke, before they could save her,Quickly did put an end to her life.8Great lamentation was made tor this ladj—Jemmy on board the ship he did steer;And then to England he homeward came sailing,With a longing desire to meet with his dear.But when her father found he was returning,A letter he wrote to the boatswain, his friend.Saying, a handsome reward I will give you,If you the life of young Jemmy will end.Void of all grace, and for sake of the money,The cruel boatswain the same did complete,As they on the deck were lovingly walking,He suddenly tumbled him into the deep.PART III.Shewing how the Ghost of young Jemmy the Sailor appeared tobeautiful Nancy of Yarmouth.In dead of the night, when all were asleep.His troubled ghost to his love did appear.Crying, Arise, you beautiful Nancy,Perform the vow you made to your dear.You are my own, therefore tarry no longer.Seven long years for your sake did I stay ;Hymen does wait for to crown us with pleasure,The bride guests are ready, then come away.She cry’d, Who is there under my window ?Surely it is the voice of my dear:. Lifting her head off her downy pillow,Straight to the casement she then did repair.By light of the moon, which brightly was shining,She espied her lover, who to her did say,9Your parents are sleeping, before they awaken, 'Stir, my dear creature, and straight come a "way,0 Jemmy, she cried, if my father should hear the.'.We shall be ruin’d, pray therefore repair.At the sea-side I will instantly meet you,With my two maids I will come to you there.Her night-gown, embroidered with gold and silver.Carelessly round her body she throws,With the two maidens who did attend her,To meet her true-love she instantly goes.Close in his arms the spirit did enfold her,Jemmy, she said, you are colder than clay ;Sure you can never be the man I admire,Paler than death you appear unto me.Yes, fairest creature, I am your true lover,Dead or alive, you know you are mine :1 come for my vow, my dear, you must followMy body now to a cold watery tomb.I for your sake refus’d gold and silver,Beauty and riches for you I despis’d,A charming young lady for me did expire,For thinking of you I was deaf to her cries.Your cruel parents have been my undoing,And I do sleep in a watery tomb,Now for your promise, my dear, I am suing,Dead or alive, love, you are my own.10PART IV.How the Ghosts of these two unfortunate Lovers appeared to theBoatswain, and he, having his trial, was hanged at the yard’s arm.The trembling lady was sorely affrighted",Amazed, she stood near the brink of the sea,With eyes lift to heaven, she cried, Cruel parents,Heaven requite you for your cruelty.Indeed I promis’d, my dearest creature.Head or alive, I would be his own ;Now to perform my solemn vow I am ready,And to follow him to his watery tomb.The maids they heard the sad lamentation,But the apparition indeed could not seeThinking the lady was fallen into distraction,They strove to persuade her contented to be.But still she cried, My dear, I am coming,And in thy bosom I’ll soon fall asleep :When she had spoke, this unfortunate ladySuddenly plunged herself jnto the deep.But when to her father the maids told the matter.He wrung his hands, crying, What have I done?Oh ! dearest child, it was thy cruel fatherThat did provide thee a watery tomb.Two or three days then being expir’d,These two unfortunate lovers were seen,In each others arms they together were floating,By the side of a ship, on the watery main.The cruel boatswain was stricken with horror,Straight did con'ess the tad deed lie had done—IIShewing the letter that came from her fatherWhich was the cause of these true-lovers’ doom.On board the ship he was tried for the murder,At the yard’s arm was hang’d for the same,Her father he soon broke his heart for his daughter.Before the ship into the harbour then came.The cursed gold has caused destruction,Why should the rich covet after gain ?I hope this story it will be a warning.That cruel parents may ne’er do the same.True love is better than jewels and treasure.Riches can Aever buy true love, I know ;But this young couple they lov’d without measure.Love was the occasion of their overthrow., isjji:onci>TIIKBLOODY GARDENER’S TRAGEDYYou constant lovers all, pray lend an earTo this relation which I hying you here;rTis of a maiden fair,A Shepherd’s daughter dear.True love did prove her overthrow.She was of beauty bright, both fair and clear,And by a noble lord she courted were ;She was too young, we find,As yet fond love to mind,But little Cupid her heart did ensnare.His parents were very high now in degree,They said, My son, she is no match for thee:If you’d our blessing have,Grant us but what we crave,Pray wed •none but to whom we shall agree.For you, my son, I’ve chose a charming bride,She’s young, and rich, and beautiful beside ;Of temper kind and free,This match I choose for thee—A shepherd’s daughter of so mean degree !13If that by us you’ll not be rul’d or led,From our presence you shall be banished ;No more we will you own,For to be our son ;0! let our will be done, or we’ll end the strife.Madam, if I a begging with you should go,Contented should I be in doing so,So that I could but haveThe girl that I crave—No cursed gold should part my dear and me.Was she as poor as Job, and I of royal line,And lord of all the globe, she should be mine ;His mother said, in scorn,My son is noble born,And with a beggar’s brat shall ne’er be join’d.He hearing of his mother saying soTears from his eyes in fountains did flow ;A promise I have made,Her heart I have betray’d,No other for my bride you e’er shall see.A snare then for her precious life she laid,And for to act the thing which she then didWith her gardener she agreed,To do this bloody deed,Her butcher for to be and dig her grave.To the bloody gardner, she gave eighty pound.To murder her, and lay her under ground ;All in a grave so deep,In everlasting sleep,That her fair body never might be found.He wrote a letter, and sent it with speed,Saying, My dearest love, with haste proceed.14Meet, me to night, mj dear.Something I will declare :Poor soul! she little thinking of the deed.She threw the letter down and run with speed,Thinking to meet her own true love indeed;She search’d the garden round,But no true love she found :At length the bloodj gardener did appear.What business have you here, madam, I pray ?0, are you come to rob my garden gay ?She said, no thief I am,I wait for a young man,Who did appoint this night to meet me here.He nothing more did say, hut took a knife,And hade her straight prepare to lose her life :She on her knees did fall,And to heaven did call,0! welcome, welcome death, my fatal stroke !Was this done, my dear, by your design ?Or was it by your parents, most unkind,My life is thus betray’d ?Farewell! fond love she said,I hope in heaven I a place shall find!V *The bloody gardener found her life was gone.Bead in the ground he laid her body down ;With flowers fine and gay,The grave did overlay.Thinking her fair body never might be found.This youthful lord, indeed, did little know,Next day to sec his own true love did go ;No shepherdess was there.All round the vallies fair,The pretty lambs were waud’ring to and fro,15Lamenting for their tender shepherdess,Then he laid him down upon the grass,The Heavens he did implore,That he might see her once more,0! then je gods, says he, I shall be bless’d.Where shall I go to find that angel bright ?She is the pleasure of my heart’s delight:Oh ! if alive she be,Once more let me her see,Or else my soul shall quickly take its flight.The woods and groves with him did seem to mourn,The small birds they did sing a mournful tuneSaying. Your true love is gone.And you are left alone :Then on a mossy bank he laid him down.He had no sooner clos’d his eyes to rest,But a milk-white dove did hover on his breast;The fluttring wings did bearWhich wak’d him from his sleep.And then the dove took flight, and he was left.Now wailing for his love, in sad despair,To his mother’s garden he then did repair,Where the dove again he did seeSitting on a myrtle tree,With drooping wings it did sorrowful appear.Thou Hove so innocent, Why did you come,0 have you lost your mate, as I have done?No shepherdess was there,All round the vallies fair,The pretty lambs were wand’ring to and fro.And on the virgin did seem to go,Out of her milk-white breast the blood did flow :it;To the place it did repair,But no true-love was there ;Then frightened to his mother he did go :And told what unto him there did appear,Saying, I fear you have kill’d my dear ;For a dove I do declare,Did all in blood, appear,And if she is dead, I’ll have my share.His mother hearing of what he did say,Did turn as pale as death, and swoon’d awayShe in distraction run,And told him what she’d done,And where the virgin’s body it was laid.He nothing more did say, but took a knife,Farewell the joy and pleasure of my life :He unto the garden flew.And pierc’d his body through ;It was cursed gold that caus’d the strife !These lovers in one silent tomb were laid,And many a briny tear for them was paid :The gardener, as we hear,Was apprehended there,And now all three are in their silent grave.17A BRIEF HISTORYROBERT RETERAin, EARL OF ESSE5,A GilEAT FAVOURITE OF QUEEN ELIZABETH JWith a Lamentable Ballad on his Death.Robert Devereaux, Earl of Essex, was in everyrespect qualified for a soldier, but tbe most unfitman in the world for a courtier. He was veryyoung when his father died; and was not takennotice of till the year 1589, a twelvemonth afterthe destruction of the Armada, at which time hehired some ships, and bore Drake company in amexpedition he was going upon.—In 1591 he beganto grow into favour, and was that year sent to theassistance of the king of France, with some forcesunder his command, and acquired much fame, sothat in 1597 he was sent admiral of an expeditioni into America. On his return he grew high in the| queen’s favour, and grew so insolent upon it asl often to contradict her ; hut this never so arro-| gantly as in the year 1598, when the queen con¬sulted with three or four counsellors about sendingj a superintendant of the affairs of Ireland into thatkingdom. The queen had thoughts of Sir William18Knowles, uncle to Essex ; but he as strenuously-stood up for Sir George Carcw ; blit with this tliequeen would not comply, when he, in a contemp¬tuous maimer, turned his back upon her, which sheimmediately resented by hitting him a box on the-ear. The earl now laid his hand upon his sword,but the others interposing, he was obliged to re¬treat. Essex afterwards made submission, andwas again received into favour. At this time therebellion in Ireland was grown to a great height,and the lord-deputy being dead, several were pro¬posed to be sent thither, when Essex hinted heshould be glad of that command, to whicli thequeen consented. He accordingly went with alarge army, and an unlimited general commission,and soon appointed the Earl of Southampton asacting general. The intention of the governmentwas, that Tir-Owen, the most formidable of therebels, should be immediately attacked ; but thewhole summer was spent in the pursuit of somerebels of little note.—This conduct obliged thequeen to send him some very sharp letters, whichhe highly resented. At length he ordered thearmy to march against Tir-Owen ; but instead ofcoming to a battle, he held a private parley with ,that rebel, and concluded a truce with him for sixweeks, renewable at the end of that time for sixweeks more, and so on. But finding his conductdisliked in England, he hastened thither, leavingIreland without orders ; upon which he was putinto custody at the lord keeper’s house. After sixmonths’ confinement he was sutt'ered to go to hisown house. The queen now proceeded againsthim, but would not suffer him to be impeached inthe star-chamber, lest they should accuse him ofhigh treason, or fine him considerably. She ap¬pointed a select commission to try him at the lord-keepers, where, after a long hearing, they determin-19i ed he should lose his places, and remain in confine¬ment during the queen’s pleasure. Had his be¬haviour, during his confinement, answered themildness with which he was treated, he no doubtwould soon have bc(Tn restored to favour ; but hev was too hot-headed, and those about him gave himi wrong counsel: they told him the ministers were! his enemies, and since he could not by fair means,'he ought to endeavour to remove them by force.Essex and his colleagues, now formed a design(. of seizing upon the palace, and in it the queen andi her counsel, and also upon the Tower and the city(of London ; but being suspected, he was summon¬ed before the council, and refused to appear, undera pretence of indisposition. Finding his measures■|i entirely broken, on the 8th of February, 1600, be-i ing Sunday, and early in the morning, he had got■ some noblemen and about 300 gentlemen with him.The news of this being brought to the queen, she-1 sent the lord keeper, with three more of the coun-i cil, to learn the meaning of so tumidtuous a con-■ I vention ; but instead of answering them, he put1 them into custody, till he could *get into the city,expecting to find every body there would join him ;but in this he was entirely deceived, as not one per¬son would take up arms. He was now proclaimeda traitor, and a party of the queen’s meeting himnear St Paul’s, there was a skirmish, in whichj some few were killed,-and Essex was obliged toretreat by water. He went to his own house,it which he fortified in some measure, but in vain,f The great ordnance was brought against him, and,i after a short defence, in which some lives werelost, he surrendered and was brought to trial, withSouthampton, before his peers, impeached of hightreason, convicted, and condemned. Southamptonwas saved; but Essex, on the 25th, (being Ash-Wednesday) was privately executed in the Tower.20Some writers have asserted, that of all the queen’sparamours, Essex wTas her greatest favourite ; thaton a certain occasion she presented him with adiamond ring, as a token of her love and esteem,and told him, that if at ai»- time he should beplaced in difficult circumstances, on sending herthis ring, she would do her utmost to relieve him.But unfortunately for him, in the time of his great¬est need, he possessed not this token of her affec¬tion—a beautiful lady of quality, whom he lovedmore than the queen, having previously got it fromhim. Some time after the death of Essex, thequeen was informed of the lady who had the ring,when she hastened to her house, where she foundher in bed, in a dying state, and dragged her fromthence on to the floor by the hair of the head, ut¬tering bitter reflections and imprecations on her forher conduct.—The queen never recovered herwonted cheerfulness after this affair, but was moreretired, and less attentive to public business. Herspirits became more and more depressed, till thespring of 1G03, when death put a period to hersufferings.THE BALLAD.All you that cry 0 Hone ! 0 Hone !Come now and sing 0 Hone with me.For why, our Jewel is from us gone,The valiant Knight of Chivalry :Of rich and poor belov’d was he,In time an honourable Knight,When by our laws condemn’d to die,He lately took his last good night.21Count him not like to Champion,Those traitorous men of Babington,Nor like the Earl of Westmoreland,. By whom a number were undone :He never yet hurt mother’s son—His quarrel still maintain’d the right.The salt, salt tears my face run down,When I think on his last good night.The Portugals can witness be,His dagger at Lisbon-gate he flung,And, like a Knight of Chivalry,His chain upon the gates he hung :I would to God that he would come,To fetch them back in order right.Which thing was by his honour done.Yet lately took his last good night.The Frenchmen they can testify,The town of Gournay he took in,And march’d to Rome immediately,Not caring for his foes a pin :With bullets then he pierc’d their skin,And made them fly before his sight;He then that time did credit win,And now hath ta’en his last good night.Would God he ne’er had Ireland known,Nor set one foot on Flanders ground,Then might we well enjoy our own,But oh, our jewel can not be found—Which makes our trickling tears abound.Washing our cheeks—a mournful sight;Still, still his name in our ears doth sound,But now he’s ta’en his last good night !•>oDAFT WATTY'S RAMBLE TOCARLISLE.Ip you ax me where I come frae, I say the fell syde.Where fadder and mudder, and honest fwok beyde.And my sweetheart, 0 bless her! she thought nyenlike me,For when she shuik hands, the tears gush’d fraeher e’e,Says I “ I mun e’en get a spot if I can,But whatever betide me, I’ll think o’ thee, Nan!”Nan was a perfect beauty, wi’ twee cheeks likecodlin blossoms ; the verra sect on her made mymouth a’ water, “ Fares-te-weel, Watty!” saysshe ; “ tou’s a wag amang lasses, and I’ll see theenae mair!”—Nay, dunnet growl, Nan, says I—“ For, mappen, er lang, I’se be maister mysel’;’Sae we buss’d, and I tuik a last luik at the fell;On I whussl’d and wander’d : my bundle I flungO’er my shoulder, when Cowley he efter me sprung,And howl’d, silly fellow! and fawn’d at my fit,As if to say, Watty, we munnet part yet!At Carel I stuid wi’ a strae i’ my mouth.And they tuik me, nae doubt, for a promisingyouth ;—The weyves com round me in clusters—“ Whatweage dus te.ax, canny lad?” says yen. “ Wey,23iothree pun and a crown ; wunnet beate a hair o’raj beard.” “What can te dui?” says anudder.“ Dui—wej I cun plough, sow, mow, shear, thresh,dike, milk, kurn, muck a byer, sing a psalm, mendcargear, dance a whompype, nick a nag’s tail,hunt a brock, or feight iver a yen o’ my weight inaw Croglin parish.”An auld bearded hussy suin caw’d me her man ;But that day, I may say’t, aw my sorrow began.Burst, Cowley, peur fellow! they bang’d i’ thestreet,And skinn’d, God forgie them! for shoon to theirfeet,I cry’d, and they caw’d me poor half-witted clown,And banter’d and follow’d me all up and down ;Neist my deam she e’en starv’d me that ever liv’dweel,Her hard words and luiks wad hae freeten’d thede’il.She had a lang beard, for aw t’warl’ like a billy-goat, wi’ a kiln-dried frosty face, and then thesmawest leg o’ mutton in aw Carel market sarvedthe cat, me and her for a week.

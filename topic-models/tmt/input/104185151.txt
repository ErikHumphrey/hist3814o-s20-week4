FOURPOPULAR SONGS.Ri o;s of the I air.©My Mither men’t my auld Breeks.Black-Eyed Susan.O say not Woman’s Tongue isstopped.FALKIRK:PRINTED FOR THE BOOKSELLERSSONGS.Rigs of the Fair.Ye lads and lasses every where,That do reside in fair,Attend a while unto my song,I’ll warrant it will not keep you long.Now fair is come again,The lassies gay and brisk young men,Dress’d in their best I do declare,To fair they all repair.And as along the road they drive,Eike fleas a jumping all alive,The girls to please, the young men try,The lads look cunning and so sly.Asd when they come unto the style,Jock hands o’er Jenny with a smile,And when they’re over— then good lack—«They give the girls a hearty smack.When to the fair they all are come,O then for brandy, gin and rum ;They buy them ribbons, gloves and rings,And more than twenty pretty things.3Besides there’s lot of cakes and wine,To eat and drink this merry time,But the finest present out of sight,To give them when its dark at night.When day is gone and night is come,The lassies cry “ let us go home,”But first of all they must advancelo a public house to have a dance.And when they do commence with joy,Some eat and drink—some kiss and toy,And some do make so bold and freeAs tickle the girls above the knee.O when the clock it has struck One,The landlord says, “you must begone;"And when into the streets you’ve got,Then arm in arm to home they trot.To shield them from the cold or frost,Jock puts his arms round Jenny’s waistBut I’d have you mind, don’t think it droll,He’ll slip his hand in your pocket hole.So now my song is almost done,I hope I have offended none;For I assure each honest friend,No sort of harm I do intend.So all young lassies gay and free,I’d had you be advised by me,And choose the lad that will be a friend,For fear of a slip at the nine months end.4Bhwl: E;,ed Sns'in.All in the Downs the fleet was moor’d,The streamers waving to the wind,When Black-eyed Susan came on hoard,O where shall I my true-love find ?Tell me. jovial sailors, tell me true,Does my sweet William sail among your crew?William, who high upon the yard.Rock’d by the billow to i nd fio.Soon as her well-known voice he heard,He sigh’d, and cast his eyes below :The cords slide swiftly thro his glowing bands,And quick as light ning on the deck he stands.So the sweet lark high poised in the air,Shuts close his pinions to his breast,(If chance his mate’s shrill voice he hear)And drops at once into her nest :The noblest captain in the British fleet,Might envy W illiam's lips those kisses sweet.O Susan, Susan, lovely dear !My vows shall ever true remain,Let me kiss of that falling tear,We only part to meet again :Change as ye list, ye winds, my heart shall beThe tUithful compass that still points to thee.Believe not what the landmen say.Who tempt with doubts thy constant mind}5They’ll tell thee, sailors, when away,In every port a mistress find ;Yes, yes, believe them when they tell you so.For thou art prcicnt wheresoe'er 1 go.If to fair India's cost we sail,Thy eyes are seen in diamonds bright,Thy breath in Abie's spicy gale,Thy skin is ivory so white;Thus every beauteous object that I view,Wakes in my soul some charms of lovely SueThough battles call me from thy arms,X.et not my pretty Susan mourn,Though cannons toar, yet safe from harmWilliam shall to his dear return ;Love turns aside the balls that round me flyLest precious tears should drop from Susan’s eye.The boatswain gave the dreadful word,The sails their swelling bosoms spread,No longer must she stay a-board;They kiss’d; she sigh'd; he hung his head.Her lessening boat unwilling rows to land.Adieu she cries, and wav’d her lily hand.My Milker merit my auld breeks.My mither men’t my auld hreeks,An’ vow but they were duddy,cAn’ sent me, to get shod our mean,At Robin i'amson’si smiddy ;J'lie smiddy stands beside the burn,dliat wimples through the clachan,I never, yet, gae by the door,But aye I fa’ a laughin’CHORUS.With my fal dal de dido,Lai de do a dady O;With my fal de dal dido,Fal lal de do a daddy, O.For Robin was a wathy carle,An’ had a bonnie dochter,Yet ne’er wad let her tak’ a man,Tho’ mony lads had sought her;But what think ye o’ my exploit ?The time our mear was shoeing,I slippet up beside the lass,An’ briskly fell a-wooing.An’ aye she e’ed my auld breeks,The time that we sat crackin’Quo’ I my lass ne’er mind the clouts,I’ve new anes for the makin’:But gin ye’ll just come hame wi’ me,An’ lea’ the carle—your father,Ye’s get my breeks to keep in trim,Mysel’ and a’ thegither.Deed lad, quo she, your offer’s fair,I really think I’ll tak’ it,Sae gang awa’ get out the mear,We’ll baith slip on the back o’t;7Fen gin I wait my father’s time.Ml wait till I be fifty.But na ;—111 marry in my prime.An’ mak’ a wife fu’ thrifty.W ow ! Robin was an angry man,At loosing o’ his dochter :Thro’ a’ the kintra- side he ran,An’ far and near he sought her;But when he cam’ to our fire-end,An’ fand us baith thegither,Quo’ I, gudeman, I’ve ta’en your bairn.An’ ye may tak’ my mither.Auld Robin girn’d and sheuk his pow,Ouid sooth 1 quo he you re merry,But I’ll just tak’ ye at your word,An’ end this hurry-burry :So Robin an' our auld gudewife.Agreed to creep thegither ;Now, I ha’e Robin Tamson’s pet.An’ Robin has my mither.Oh Say not Womans tongue is stopped.Oh say not woman’s tongue is stoppedBy any human measure ;Ob say not woman’s tongue is stoppedBy aught but 1 eaven’s pleasure.When first her tongue its language knows,To stop it—vain endeavour ;Both day and night her clapper goes,She talks and talks for ever.8Oh say not woman’s voice is air,Ami hurts not while it ranges;Tb me its sounds can but can compare,To ringing peals and changes.And when her thwarted passions storm,tier tongue moves like a river,To stop its course there ;s no charm,It runs and runs t’oi ever.Oh say not woman’s tongue grows old,And with her eye will weaken;Oh say not woman’s tongue can t scold,When with years it is stricken..Ah ! no, that tongue that once can talkWill quit its office never,E’en when her legs no longer wa:k,’Twill talk and talk for ever.Thy wife's tongue never think to tire,When scolding she is hot on :All that you can t’avoid its ire,Is stuff your cars with cotton.For woman’s tongue will soon opposeAll reason ere so clever;It st'ms for neither words nor blowsBut scolds and scolds for ever

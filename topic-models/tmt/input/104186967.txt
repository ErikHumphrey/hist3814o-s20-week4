All this have I feen and heard, and been| witnefs to, but my pen being a-goofe-quill, cannot1 expofe their names nor place of abode, but warnsI the working men out of their way.! Secondly, I fee another fort, who can work andH maun work till they be married-and become millrefsis themfelvcs j.bin as the hufuand receives them, the^ thrift leaves them ; before that, they wrought as forii a wager, they fpan as for a premium, bulked as for; a brag, fcoUrcd their din-fkins as a wauker does wo>4 JANET’S ORATION.Red blanket, kept as rriim in the month as a mini-fter’s wife, comely as Diana, chafte as Sufanna, ycVithe vt’hole of their toil is the trimming of their rig-jging, tho’ their hulls be everlaftingly in a leakingcondition j their backs and their bellies are box’d a^tbout with the fins of a big filh, fix petticoats, a gowraand apron, befides a fide fark down to the ancle-ebones, ah! what monftrout rags are here* what Acloth is confumed for the covering to one pair of but-ftocks; I leave it to the judgment of any ten taylortiin town, if thirty pair of men’s breeches may not becut from a little above the eafing of Befly’s bum, andthis makes her a motherly woman, as ftately a fabricas ever (trade to market or mill.But when (lie’s married, (he turns a madam, hermiftrefs did not work much, and why (hould (he ?Her mother tell’d ay (lie wad be a lady, but cou’dnever (how where her lands lay ; but when money i$iall fpent, credit broken, and condu£t out of keep¬ing, a wheen babling bubly bairns crying piece min-jny, portch minny, the witlefs wanton waiter is ather wit’s end. Work now or want, and do not faythat the world has war'd you; but lofty Noddle, yourgiddy-headed mother has led you aftray, by learningyou to be a lady before you was fit to be a fervant-lafs, by teaching you lazinefs inftegd of hard labour,by giving you fuch a high conceit of yourfelf, thatno body thinks any thing of you now, and you mayjudge yourfelf to be one cf thofe that wife people callLittle-woith j but after all, my dear dirty-face, whenyou begin the warld again, be perfectly rich beforeyou be gentle, work hard for what you gain, andyou’ll ken.better how to guide it, for pride is an un~perfetfl: fortune, and a ludicrous life w ill not laft long.Another fort I fee, who has got more filver thanfenfe, more gold than good nature, mote muflinsand means than good manners ) tho’ a fack can holdtheir filver, fix houfes and a half cannot contain the.rambitious defires.

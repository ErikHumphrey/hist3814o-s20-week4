When he wa« aboutto enter on the Minia.y, a young woman fell with child,in adultery, to a fervant in the houfe where he ftayed:when flic found herfelf to be fo, fte told the father of it;who faid. I’ll run for it, and go to Ireland ; fathcr t on*hr°p±n he Ms more to help you to bring it up (hefa i^ a fmallheritage) than I have. The fame dat that. f t V u ;-,-r to hcence Mr. Peoen to betcry and fa-.d, I hear r u _ bini.sMlnifter; but do it not, for 1 flm.Morfe_He being without at the 'ime, was cahe ' V ’ ;r.or: Liprifed, I car not fp;^ ? ^ ,etfr^f it ,rd God willthought of me, .or I am t R hrvindicate me in his own ^ waj « ^ ^,.t walked at a water-fide , w got what I-ither eat nor drink, but faid, 1 ' . f n., and I Will be Vindicated, and that P ^; will pay dear for-it in her ’me, and will mak .( 3 )a difnial enl; and for this furfeif of grief that fh? hathgiven oie, there fhall never one of her fex come into mybofom. And, accordingly, he never mirried. There arevarious reports of the way that he was vindicated : Somefay, the time the was in child-bwth, Mr. Guthrie charge!her to give account who was the father of that child iand difcharged the women to be helpful to her, until (hedid it. Some fay that (lie confeffed ; others, that <he re¬mained obftinate. Some of the people, when I madeenquiry about it in that cocntryfide, affirmed, that afterthe Pn-fbytery had been at all pains about it, and couldget no fatufaftion, they appointed Mr. Guthrie to givea full relation of the whole before the congregation,which he did ; and the fame dayfather cf the childbeing prefeni, when he heard.Mr. Gutittle begin to reatt,he ftood up, and debred him to halt, and faid, “ I amthe father of that child, and l deured her to father iton Mr. Peden, which has been a great trouble of ccnfci-cuee to me; and I could not get reft, tii! I came hometo declare it.” However, it is certain, that after 2j: v.aimarried, every ttiirg crcfs to them ; and they wentfrom place to place, and were redeer*' to great poverty.At iaft ILe came to that fame fpot of ground where heflayed upwards of hours, and made away with hrrfeif.a. Af.er this he was three t ears fettled minifter atKew Giehtdce in Galloway; and when he wa« obliged,by the violence and tyranay of that tmu, to leave thatparith, he ieftured upon Aits x:<. 17, to the end. andpreached upon the rid. vtrle in the forenopc, “ There-foie watch, and remcntibcr, that for the fpace of tbyj^yeais, I ceafed not to warn every one, night and «ay,with tears.” AlfertiGg that he had declared ',{j< wbolacounfel of God, and had kept nothing back; . pf0.ftlled that he was free of the bio.'d of ail fouls. ^acjvathe afternoon, he preached on the jad verfe, “ .adrow, brethrea, I ccmnoeod you to God, .. nd to the . ordof his grace, which is able to build you up, and to giveA 2( 4 )you an inheritance among ail them that are fandliged »>.ncm.ebcfita,,; b»t the, forrowe/JiT/ij’he told them that they fcoald never fee his (ace in thatpulpit agam. He continued until nifeht, and when heclofed the puipit daor, he knocked hard upon it threetmteit w.th hss Efbfc, faying three times over, I arreft injny Matter $ name, that never one enter there, but fuch^ come in by the,doc*r, as I did. Accordingly, neithercurate nor indulged mihifter ever entered that pulpit,unM after the Revolution, that a Preftyteriau Minifteropened. It. I had the account from old perfona in thatpanth, who were witodTes to it, worthy of all credit.. 3,V f-f!er Ithi8« he Jain^ tiat haneft and zealousiandful, in the year 1666, that was broken at Pentlaudhills, and came the length of Clyde with them, wherebe had a melancholy view of their euS, and parted withthem there. James Cuhifon, of Paluchamits, my in¬former, to whom he told this, he laid to him, “ Sir, youd'd well that fraets-d witii them, feeing you was perfuadcdthey would fall and flee before the enemy. Glory, gl0i yto God, that he fent me not to hell immediately ! for iftould have ftayed-with them, though I thould have beencut all in p'eces.,,4- That night the Lord’s people fell, and 3ed beforethe enemy at Pentland hilis, he was in a friend’s hpufein Carrick, 60 miles from Edinburgh ; his landlord feeingbim mightily troubled, enquired how it-was vvithubim ?He faid. To-morrow I will fpcak with you ^ and defiredfome candle. That night he went to bed ; the nextmorning calling early to his landlord, laid, f have fad newsto tell you, onr friends that were together in arms, ap¬pearing for Chrift’s intereft, are now broken, killed, takenand fled every man. He faid, Why do you fpeak fo.’There is a great partef ourfriends prifoe’ers in Edinburgh.About forty-eight hours thereafter, they were fully pQa’'armed in the truth of it.( 5 )5. In June ii73. vras taken by Major Cnckbum,in the hoirfe of Hugh Fergufon, of Koockdow, in Carrick,who conftra'.nrd him to tarry ail night. Mr. Peden toldhim, that it would be a dear night's quarters to them both.Accordingly, they were carried prifoners to Edinburgh.Hugh Fergufon was fined in aihoufaud merks, for relet¬ting harbouring, and convening with him. The Councilordered fifty pounds fterling to be paid to the Major, outof the fines, and ordained him to divide ay pounds fter.among the party that apprehended him. Some time afterexamination, he was fent prifoner to the Bafs, where,and at Edinburgh, he remained until December i6f$,that he was baalihed.6. While prifoaer in the Bafs, one Sabbath morning,being about the p-ib ic worihip of G d, a young lals,aoout 15 or i4 years of age, came to the chamber door,tnockiag with loud laughter: He laid, Poor thing, themmocks and laughs at the woriinp of God, but, ere long,Gao lltail wr te loch a fudden and furprifing judgmenton thee, tnat ifcail ftay thy laughing, and thou fhalt notc cape it. Shortly ai:er, flie was walking upon the rtscb,an a th._re came a Wall of wind, which fweeped her infot. - <ea, where Ihe periihed. While prifoher there, oneoay wa.k.ng upon the rock fome foldiera paffing by him,one ot them faid, Efevil take him i Fy, fy, poor roan, faidEe, thou knoweft not what thou art ftymg; but them wiltrepent that. At which word the foldier fiord aftonifbed !a*d went to the guard diftratfed, crying out alcud forr lMea> hfwg, Tae devil would immediately takeim a\/ay . lie came to him again, and found him in bittight caind, under deep convictions of great guilt t heguaru being to change, the yde fired him to goto hi* arms-c rctufed, aud faid, he would lift no arms a gain ft Tefiisnritt a caufe, and per&cute his people, he had done thattoo long f ne governor threatened him with death nextday uy tea of the clock; he coufideniiy faid, three times,though it: Ibould tear all his body in pieces, he (houidA 3i(^)...v,r nft arms tV,t w*y. A'bout three day* after, theEonvnor put r.tro out of the garrlfoa, letting h.ra adiore.Me havin ’ a wife atid-children, took a houte in E. fcLothian, where he became a lingular Chrituaa Mr Peuentold theft aftonifliing tbinga to the fore laid John Cubilon,and othera, wio ir.fotmed me.7 When brought from the 3rf3 to Edinburgh, andfeotence of banilhment pzSid upon him in Dec. Ul*-and Gsty more fellow prifoners, fur the fame csuie t. goto America, never to be teen in Scotland ngam, uudcithe pain of death ; after .this feutence was pr ded he fa.di'tvi.ral titnea, that the ihip was not pet buut ‘^at Ihou^take him and thefe prifoners to Virginia, or any o.her oithe Engliih plantations in America. One James Kay,n fol -S and grave Chriftian, b^iug one of them, Vib° 1,'eJfttbr about the Water of Leith, told me, that Mr. Pedcaraid to him, James, when your wife comes in, let me leeher- which he did. After feme diioourfe, he ca..ed fora drink ; andwhen he fought a buffing, he fdd. GoodLord, let not James Kay’s wife mifs her hufband, tillthou return him to her in peace and faiety ; which wej.re iure will be fooner than e tlier he orffie is looking fcr.Accordingly, the fame day month that he parted with heri Ldth, he came home to her at the Water of Leith.g. When they were on ffiipboard, at the Water cf Leith,♦her- was a report, that the enemies were to fend downthumbkins, to keep them from rebelling; at the report ofwhich, they were greatly difeouragtd : Mr Peden caroaabove the deck, and faili. Why are ye d.fccuraged t Youneed not fear, there will neither thusnbkins cor boo-kinscome here : Lift up your hearts and heads, for the dayof vour redemption draweth near; if we were once upat London, we will be all let at liberty And, when onthe voyage, praying publicly, he fa:d, Lord, luch is theenemies’ hatred at thee, and mshce at us. for thy fake,that they will not let us ftay m thy land of Scotland, toierve th,e tho’ fottw of us have nothing but the canopy*-1( 7 )of thy haver's abov-s us, and the earth to tread upon jbut. Lord, we bkfs thy ria.ut, woo will cut ihort ourvoyage, and ft nurate thy eEeinit«s oi tircir wicked deiigri,that they wi 1 not get us where they intend ; and foiesof us ihaU go richer home, taau we came from home.James Pride, who lived in Kite, an acueit man, being ocecf them, he laid many times, he could alVert the truthof this, for be came faiciy home; aud be fids,other things,be bought two cor.vs : and before that, he never had one.I had tbefe accounts both from the ioteiaid James Kay,and Robert Punton, a known public man, worthy of allcredit, who tea? aifo u d;r the fame fenter.ee, who livedin the parifh of Daimcny, near Queeasfcrry.9 When they arrived at London, the Skipper whoreceded them at iysith, was to carry them i.o further:the Skipper who was to receive them tnere, and carrythem to Virgii ia, came to tec them, they being repref^nt-ed so him as thieves, robbers, and evd doers; but whenhe found they were ali grave Chriftian men, banilhed forPrefbyserian principles, he faid he would fail the fea withnone Inch. So, as the one Skipper would cot receive them,and the other would keep them no longer, it being veryexpenfive to maintain them, they were all fet at liberty.Others reported, that both the Skippers got complimentsfrom friends at London ; however, it is certain, they allwere fafely fet free, without any impofition of bonds oroaths; and friends at London, and in their way home¬wards thro England, the wed much kindnefs unto them.10 That difinal day, June aad. 1679, at Bothwel-bridge, that the Lord’s people fell, and fled before theenemy, he was 40 milrs dittact, near the border, and kepthimfelf retired until the middle of the day, that fume .friends fatd to him, Sir, the people are waiting forfermon.He faid, Let the people go to their prayers: for me, Ineither can nor will preach any this day; for our friendsare fallen, and fled before ahe enemy at Hamilton; aad( 3and they ar« and haftiiag -theia down, and tteablood is runmcs TiWt waler.ii. After thU, b: was pieaebtag in GiHoway. In thefdrenoon he prayed esrne/Uy tor the prifoners taken atand about Both wit; but in the afternoon, when he beganto pray for them, he ha'.'.ed and faid, Sirs, our nencaat Edinburgh, the prifoners, have done foraething to favetheir lives, that Hr U not do with them, fcr the fea b\. owaCiall be many of tkeir winding fh;ets,'ird tie iv wo t emthat ihall efcape, fhail not be ufcful to God in their gene¬ration. Which was fadly verified there~!tvi, Th jtw icithe greateft part of theft prifoners did, was the taking o,that bond, commonly called the clack B-md, a..cr o.wel, wherein they acknowledged their appearance in armsfor the defence of the gofpel and their owe lives to berebellion ; and engaged taemfetves never to make anymoreoppofition , upon the doing of which, there per fid,-cue enemies ptomifcd them life and liberty. This, withthe curfed and fubtil arguments aad advices of raimders,who went into the New Yard, where they were pnfoners,particularly Mr. Hugh Kenedy, Mr. William Crighton,Mr. Edward jamiefon, and Mr. George JahnftoD ; thefctook their turn in ihe yard, where the pnfoners were,together with a letter that was feat from that Eraftiaumeeting of Minifters, met at Edinburgh in Auguft 1679,for the acceptance of a third indulgence, with a Caution-ary Bond. Notwithftanding of the enemies’ promife,and the onlwtppy advice of Minifters not indulged, afterthey were enfnared in this foul compliance, they banilhedthereof 105 periflied in the *-.‘rkney fea. This f''ul*ep, as fome of them told, both in their life, and whendying, lay heavy upon them all their days; and thatthefe unhappy arguments and advices of Minifters. pre¬vailed more with them, than the enemies’ promile oflife and liberty. In Auguft 16;?. Fifteen of the Bothweiprifoaers got indictments ot death. Mr. Edward Jamie¬fon, a worthy Prcfbytaiaa minifter, as Mr. Woodrow( 9 ) 'calls him. wag feat from that Eraftian meeting of Minifters.into the Tolbooth to theft 15, who urged the Uwfumefaof taking the Bend to fare their lives, and the refufal of itwould be a reflection on religion, and the caufe they hadappeared for, asd a throwing away their lives, for whichtheir friends would not be able to vindicate them Heprevailed with ij of them, which foured iu the ftomachaof Tome of thofe 13, and lay heavy upon them, both intheir life and death. The prifonera taken at and ab<*itthe tithe of Bsthwel, were reckoned about ijoo Thefaithfai Mr. John Blackader did write to thefe pri oners,diffaadiog them from that foul compliance t and femeworthy perfona of tfcefe prifoners, whom he wrote to,faid to me with tears, that they flighted his advice, andJwallowed the unhappy advices of Ihefe MinifLcra whowere making peace with the enemies of Gad, and fol¬lowed their foul fteps, for which they would go mosrn-big to their graves, I heard the fame Mr. Blackaderpreach his laft public fermon, before hia falling intothe enemies’ hands, in the night time, in tqe fields, inin the parifli of Livingflone, upon the fide cf the Muir,2! Newjatfufe, on the 93d. of March, after Bothwel,where he ledtured upon Mtcah iv. from the 9th verfe,where he aflerted, That the nearer the delivery, ourpuns and Ihowere would come thicker and fortr uponus; and that we had been long in the fields, but ere wcwere delivered, we would go down to Babylon : Thateither Pepery would cverfpread this land, or be at thebreaking ia upon ua, like an inundation of water. Andpreached upon that tr.:t, “ Let no man be moved withtbc.e aiTufLons; for ye yourf Ives know, that ye are:i appointed thereunto ” Where he infixed on whatmoving and lL«l..ng dilpenfations the Lord had exer-citcd kia people with in former ages,, cfpecialiy thatr.an of God, tnat went to Jeioboacn at Bethel, aJV^telivcreri his conim tfion faithfu ly, and yet was turnedrut cf the way by an old king prophet; bow ajovics( io )the manner of his death was to all Ifrael! And earneftiyrequeued us, fo take good heed to wba’ Minifters weheard, and vyhat advice we followed When he prayed,%e bleffed the Lord that he was free of both band and.rope; and that be was ae efearlr willing, to hold upthe public bleft ftanriard of the Gofpel as ever: Andfaid, The Lord rebuke, give repentance and forgivenefsto thefe Minifters that perfuaded thefe priioners to takethat bond For their perilhing by fes, was more mov¬ing and fljpcking to him, than if thoufiods of them hadbeen fla'n in the field. He was thereafter taken, the 6th.of April, by Major J ihnfton, in Fdinburgh,' and de¬tained prifoner in the Bafs. where he died. As theintereft of Cbrift lay near his heart through bis life,*amongft his laft words be f«id, The Lord would defendhis own caufe.After the public murdering of thefe two worthywomen-martyrs, Jfobtl Allifon ar.cj Miiion Harvie, inthe Grafsmarket of Edinburgh, January 1681, he watin Galloway; a profeffor of fome note, who had morecarnal wit and policy, than to fufter hips to be boneSand faithful, alter reafoning up m she .grounds of theiifafferings, afiirmed that they would never be reckonedamong the mrr.ber of the martyrs. Mr. Pedtn faidafter tnufing a li tie, Let alone, you will never be hon¬oured with fcch a death: A.nd for wtat you have faitagain* thefe two worthy laflVs, your death will be botfc.fjdden and furprilmg. Which came to patsveryhereafter: for the man tin riding bef-re the fire, fmoakinjbis pipe* dropt down dead, without fpeaklr.g more.ry In the roonJh of June i^Ra- be was in the hourof James Brown, in Pnddockholm, Shove Douglas; Job’•Wilfaa in Lana k was with him who fuffered tnartyrdorin the Grafs market of Edittbsirgb the nex' year. May t68jHe leftured at night upon Amos vin. and repeater 'hej •words in the g‘h verfe three times, ‘ And f ’’1 ’’iagaieft the bnu'e of Jeroboam v. iti the fwurd.” He las( 11 )fci» hand on the faid John, and faid, Encourage yourfelfin the Lord, and bold him faft, John, for you will win upyonder thortly, and get on your brswp. That night hewent to the fields, and to-morrow, about 6 o’clock, Johnwent to feek him, and found him coming to the houfc.He faid, John, let ns go from this houfe, for the devil isabout it, and wilt take his prey with him. John faid,We will take breakfaft ere we go, it is a queftion whenwe will get the offer again. He anfwered, No, no, 1 willnot eat bread in this place, our landlord is an unhappyman, the devil will get him (hortly, for be will hang him-frff. Which foon after came to pafa; for his daughter,lean Brown, was the firft that get him in her arms, hang¬ing in the ft -ble. She was reckoned by all, to be a graveChriftian lafs j but from that day never had her health,and died of a decay at laft, after fire had been fome timein prifon for her principles. Tcia paffage the lame JohnWilfoa reported federal times to many, and fome alivecan bear witnefs to the truth of it.x4. In the year 1680, a little after the murdering ofMr. Cameron, a^d theft worthies with him, at Airdlmofs,he was near Machiine, in the (hire of Ayr; • r.e ffobertBrown, of Cfofshoufe, who lived near Newmills, and oneHugh Pinaneve, factor to the Earl of Lothian, ftabledtheir horfes in that boufe where he was, and went to a tairin Machiine ; and, in the afternoon, when they came totake away their horfes, they got a diink, and in the timeof it, the faid .Ingh, a wicked wretch, both in principleand practice, broke out in a railing againft !uffe*ers, par-tic.uit.Tly againft Mr. Cameron: Mr Peden being in ano¬ther room over hearing all, was fo grimed, that he camep chamber <}oor. and faid to the fatd Hugh, Sir, holdt0 th' 1c- ere twelve o’clock thou (halt know whs' forTCm^nMr. Cameron was; God fhall punifh that b’afphem-or, mouth and curfed tongue of yours^m fnch a manner° V b-afeoniihing to all that Qiall fee you, and ftiallLVycu u? as a beacon to all railing Rabfhakebs. Robert( 12 )Brown knowing Mr. reden, h«1eJ to hi* borfe, beingperfuaded that Mr. Peden’a words would not fall toground, and fearing that fotne mifchief might befal h.mfor being in the faid Hogh’e company, he rooe hard hoi u.Robert went to his own houfe, and Hug to , e_‘^rhoufe ; and calling cffhia boots, he was ftruc. vvah fucaa ficknefs and pain through his body, with his mouth iowdde, and his tongue hanging fofar out, in a fear u maa-n'er, that they fent for the faid Robert. Being u.cu odraw blood, he drew fome from him, but all in vain, forhe died before nvdnight The faid Robert, an old man,told me this paflage when in prifon together.J5. In the year 16B2, he was in Kyle, and preachedupon"that text, “The plowers plowed up™*nybacU,and dr™, long .Srir farrow.” Wborr b tod. Wo»Uvou know who firft yoked this plow ? It was curfed Ca n,when he drew his furrows fo long deep, t a. - «out the heart-blood of his brother Abel; and Ins cur.edfeed has, and will ga'S fummer and winter, froft 2"d trel“weather, till the world’s er.d; and at the found of the Isfttrumpet, when ail are in a flame, their theets wid burn,and their fwingletrees will fall to the ground ; the p.ow-mtn will lofe their grips of the plow, and the gadmenwill throw away their gads; and then, O the ycll ng anufhrieking that will be among all this curfed feed, dappingtheir hands, and crying to the hills and mountains tocover them from the face of the Lamb, and of him thatfits upon the tnrone, for their hatred of him, and raihceat his people. After fermon, when marrying a pair offolks, when the man had the woman by the hand, he faid.Indeed, man, you nave a bonny bride by the hand, I feea covetous devd in her; ihe is both a thief and a whore,let her go, you will be alharaed of her. The man keeping{aft her hand, he faid, You will not take my advice, butit will tend to thy diigrace. After marriage, when pay¬ing, he faid, Good Lord, many a plow bath been yoked|on fte back of tfre Churc’i of Scotlarid, Pagan? yokedtheirs, Anticbiitt yoked his, and Prelacy hers, and nowtiv*.plagued ErafUan indulged they have yoked theirs,and it ill becomes them; Gnod Lord, cut their theetrthat the fw'.ng’c trees may fail to the ground. EnfignJolin Kirkland was witnefa to this feraioo and marriage;he was my dear acquaicstance. who toid me fevcral timeaof this, and more cf that feriTTon.16. About the fame time, he was marrying two pairof folks; he faid to the one, Stand by, I will not marryyou this day. The bridegroom was anxious to knowthe reafen ; after enquiring privately, he faid, You willthank me for this afterwards, and think yourfelf well quatof her, for fire is with child to another wife’s burband :Which was matter of faR, as time afterwards difeovered.;17 Shortly after that fad droke at Bothwel, he wentto Ireland, but d:d not, ttay long at' that time. In hiatravels through Galloway he came to a bcu/e, and look¬ing in the goodman’s face, he faid. They call y .u anthooefl man, but if you be fo, you look not like jt; youwill nit loeg keep that name, but will difeover yourfelfto be what you are. And (hor !y after, he was made toflee for iheep dealing. In that ihort time he w^in i-eland, the Governor required of all Prefbyteriaa.toinifterkthat were m Ireland, that they fhould give it under theirhard, that they had no acctfiion to the late rebellion »■Bothwel bridge, in Scotland, sod that they did not ahp; ove of it; which the moft part did, and fent ftt. Thoml'Cowans, a Scotfmatn, and one Mr. Patou .'rom the nr,rfuot Ireland to Dublin, to prefer t to the Lordthe which, whe; M' Pt dec heard, he faid Mr r Jand his^otber Mr ^ merrand but God w,li arreft them by the cafe A Jir? g; *-m b’ *■7 »4kficknefs and Mr Paten ,el) ^rom his horfe, and broke ortrufted his leg, and both cHhem were detained beyond( U )fTpe&ation. I had tb s account from fotne worthyCliriftiana when I was in Inland.j8. In the year 1681, he married j -ha Brown in Kyle,at his own botife in Priefthall, that Gcgular Cariftian,upon Mai ion Weir; after marriage he faid to the bride,Marion, you have got a good man to be your imfband,but you will not enjoy him long; prize his company, andkeep linen by you for bis winding fheet, for you will havenred of it, when you are not looking for it, and bis deathwill be ablioJyone. This came fidly to pal's in thebeginning of May i68j, as afterwards Qiall appear.19. After tb's, in the year i68a, be went to Irelandagain, and came to the houfe of William Steel, in Gk n-wharry, in the eounty of Antrim ; where be enquired atMrs Steel, if fhe wanted a fervant for threlhing '•iftual?She faid they did, and enquired wiat his w ges werea-day, or a-weefe? Ie faid, the common rate was a com¬mon rule; to wfcich flic afiTented At nigtt he was putto the barn to bed, with the fervant lad . and that nighthe fpent in prayer and groaning, up and down the barn.Tomorrow he thrtlbed vidfual with thdlad, and the nextihght he fpent the fame way. The fecond day, in themorC'Dg, the lad faid to his miftrefs, This man deep- none,but groans and prays all night; I get no Beep for him.He threfhea very well, and is not fparing of himfelf, tho*I think he has not been ufed with it; for he can do noth-ir- to the boUeling and ordering of the barn ; and whenI put the barn in order, he goes to fucli a place, and therehe prays for the afflidled Church of Scotland, and namesfo many people in the furnace. He wrought the fccondday, and his raiftrefs watched and overheard him praying,as the lad had faid. At night fbe defired her hufband toenquire ifhe was a Minifter, which be did, and defiredhim to be free with him, and he ftouid not only be noenemy, but a friend to him. Mr. Peden faid, be was notafhamed of his office, and gave an account of hia csrcutn-( *5 )?arces. He was do more- fet to work, nor to lie withhelaJ; and he ftald a c^nfiderable time io that place,.od was a b'.cfied ioftruxtiU in the converfion of fame,od civihi ng of ethers, though that place w-’s noted for *t wild, rude people, and the fruit of his labour appearsinto this day. There was a fervaot lafs in that boufe,hat he coul J not lor-k upon but with frowns'; and fome-iimes, when at fani'iy-wurjfcip, he faid, pointing to heririth a frowning countenance.

After the tinging, in prefacing, he criedout, Pack, and let us go to Scotland, let us flee from onedevouring fword, and go to another; the poorheneft ladsm Scotland, are running upon the hills, and have tittle cfOther meat or drink but cold and hunger; and the bloodyenemy are parfuing and murdering them, wherever theyfind them, their h ood is running like water upon IcaiToldaand fields; rife, go and tase part with them, for wn fearthey bar ue out,of heaven.

But notwitc-ftanding of ail this, 1.2 tell you good news, Keep in mindthis year, month and day, and remember that I tcid you,that the enemies have got afhot beneath their right winy,aad they may rife and fiy like a foot bird, but ere this dayfeven years, the ftrongeft of them alt iliail fail. Then upoathe fixth, he was in that wood ail d,;y; and at night hecame to the faid Mr. Vernot’s houfe, where fevera! ofour Scots i’ufterers were, he faid, Why are ye fodifeourag-cd ?

The asv?3 of this came not to Ireland for 34 iewa^3{ IS;)\r(er;aftr;.

After this he longed to be cut cflrehrid, throughthe fearful appreheafions of that difmai day oftebellionin Ireland, that came upon it four years thereafter, andtha he might take part vyilh the fafferers of Scotland.Com;ng near the coaft one morning, John Mairhead cameto him l.iag vvi: bin a hedge : He faid, Have ye any news,John? John faid, There is great fear of the Iriih riling,He faid, No, no J rhn; the time of their rificg is not yet;but they will rife, and dreadful will it be at laft. Heyvas long detained waiting for a' bark, not daring to goto public ports, but to feme remote creek of the fea.Alexander Gordon of Kiattuir, in Galloway, had agreedwith one, but Mr Peden would not fail the fea with him,having foue. fore fight of what he did prove afterwards.In the begiuning of Auguft beforethis, K.nftuir was re¬lieve : at Thterken p th, going from Dumfries to Edin¬burgh prifoner; When the news of it came to Ireland,our Scots fuffercs, their acquaintance were glad of thenews, efpecially that Ktnftnir had efcaped. He faid.What mean all this Kinftuiring ? ftiere is fome of them' relieved there, ’that one of them is worth many of him;for ail will be afhamed of him ere all be don”. Being inthis ft ait, he faid to Robert Wark, an old worthy Cbrif-tian, worthy of credit, 'Robert, go, and take fuch a mattwith you, and the fitft barb you can find, compel them,for they will be like the dogs in Egypt, not one of themwill move their tongue againft you Accordingly, Robertand bis comrade f und it out fo, and brought her to thatfecret place where he was.

Thisfad'y came to pafs in his life, and was a reproach to it athis death. A Irttle before they came off, he baptifed a chillito John Maxweil, a Glafgow roan, who was fled over fromthe perfccutipn : In his dife urfe before baptifm, he burftout into a rapture, foretelling that black day that was tocome upon Ireland, and fad days to Scotland, _and afterall this, was to come good days. Mrs. Maxwell, or^ir/Llphiugftnn, the mefther of the child, yet alive iuGlafgow, told me this, that in the time he was afferliagthefe things, fh; was thinking and wondering what groundcf aflurance he had for them, he cried aloud, (baking hiahand at her, and (aid, Woman, thou art thinking andwondering within thyftlf, whether I be fpeaking thofethings out or the vilionS of ray own head, or if I be taughtby the Spirit of God ; I tell thee, woman, thou (halt liveand fee that I am not miftaken.

At this exercife alfo he told them,that he could not win off till he got this done, and thi*was all the drink-money he had left in Ireland, and tothe family (pointing to the landlord) for all the kiednefshe had met with from them. After baptifm, they gotbreakfatt; and there was plenty of bread upon the table:A' ftekiog a blcflinir, he put his hand beneath the.bread,ho’ding it up wi : much affeftion and teara, faid.

The Waiters being advertifed of the barkbeing in that place, they and other people came on them,which obliged them that were to come off, to fecure theWatters and people all-together, for fear of the garrifonof Cirrickfergus apprehending them, being near to it,which obliged them to come off immediately, however itmight be with them. After that he and a6 of our Scotsfuffererers eame aboard, he flood on the deck and prayed,there being not the lead wind, where he made a rehearfalof times and places, when and where the Lord had heardtod anfwered them in the day of their diftrefs, and nowthey were in a great /trait. Waving his hand to the weft,from whence he defired the wind, be laid, Lord give usaloof-full of wind: Fill the fails, Lord, and give usa frefli gale, and let us have a fwift pafiage over to thebloody land, come of us what will, John Muirhead,Robert Wark, and others who were prefen?, told me, thatwhen he began to pray, the fails were all hanging ftraightdown; but ere he ended, ifu-y were all like blown blad¬ders. They put out the Waiters and other people andgoi a very fwiff and fafe paffage. The z6 Scots fuftererathat were with him, having provided themfelves witharms, and being designed to return to Scotland, therefeeing then fuch a noife cf killing; and indeed the d'ta( 21 )was no greater.than the deed, it being then in the heat ofkilting liii.e, in tfc? end of February i«8y, when at exercifein the Bark, be,.. •, Ljfd thou ktioweft thefe iads arebet fpwited, lay ah arieft -upon them, /that they may not-appear; their time is noi yet* though Monmouth andArgyle be cmiiing. theywili woik no deiiTcranre. At thattime there was no report of their coming, for they camenot for ten weeks thereafter. In the morning after theylanded, he ledtured before they parted, fitting upon abraefide, where he had fearful threatnir.ge againft Scotland,faying. The time was coming that they might travel manymiles in Galloway and Nitbfdale, Ayr and Clydefdale,and not fee a reeking houfe, nor hear a cock crosv. Andfurther faid. That his fou! trembled to think, what wouldbecome of the indulged,' backflidden and uplitten mini-fters of Ssotland; as the Lord Uvea, none of them fhallever be honoured to put a right pin in the Lord's taber-nacij, nor afiert Chrilt's kingly prerogative, as head andking of his church. To the fame puipofe faid the never-to-be-forgotten Mr Donald Cargill, within eight hourscf his martyrdom, that he feared though there were notanother tolniftry in all the earth, be would make no moreufe of them in a national reformation,' bat fend dreadfuljudgments upon themfelves, and a long curfe upon theirpofterity. And Mr. Rutherford faid, in his day, 1656,That fad and heavy were the judgments and indignationfrom the Lord, that was abiding the uofaiihful watchmenof Scotland ; meaning tbe unhappy Refoluiioners. Whenended, he prayed earneftiy for many things, particularly,that all the firs they had committed in Ireland, mightbe buried in that place, and might not fpread w'itb themthrough’the finful land. * •*-24. When the greater part took their farewell of him,be faid £0 the reft, To what hotife or place ftia'l we go?One Hugh K'n'^edy’ faift, We will go to fuch a iioufe.He laid, -Htwie, we will not get in cur note there t fort^e devi; and ir,s bairns are there.

He faid to Hugh, Hewie, this is nay errand here.ay. They went eaftward. fomewhat contrary to his in¬clination : when they came to the top of an hill, upwardsof t wo miles diffentffom the place they defigned, he halt¬ed and faid, I wi 1 not go one foot further this way; thereb undoubtedly danger before us. A herd l^d being there,fhe gave him a groat, and defired him to go to that boufe,and fetch him meat and news. When the lad came tothe honie, the goodwife hafted, and gave him fome meatto them, faying, Lad, run hard, and tell them, that theenemies are fpread ; and we are looking for them hereevery minute. As the lad was going fiom the houfe,eighteen of the eaenrrcs foot appeared, who cried to him,Stand dog ! But the lad ran, and fix of them purfaed halfa mile, and fired hard upon him ; a ball went clofe by hishead: All that time Mr. Peden cor tinned in prayer forhim alone, and with the reft, being twelve men. Whenpraying with them, he laid, Lord, fhali the poor lad, thatis gone our errand, feeking bread to fupport our lives,lofehis? I3:re>3: the ballet* by his head ; hovr-ever near,let them not touch him. Good Lord, Tpread the lap ofthy cloak, and cover the poor lad. And in this he washeard and anfwered, in that there was a dark mUty Cloudparted him and them.cS About this time there wa? an horeft poor womanbrought him and them force bread and milk : When feek¬ing a blcffiop, he fbd, Now, in this bloody land, this poor iWoman has endangered her hfc, in bringing bread to lup- •port ours; we cannot pay her for ft, but Lord, it is for \thy fake (he has brought it: and there is no need that ;tfiae fhouki be a loo Ter at thy hand : Thou giveft plenty or .( 23 )bread to many that arc not f j worthy of it.

Go home, you have neitherart nor part with us; there will be a black account heard^ of you ere long. Accordingly, vety fhortly thereafter, hewent to Edinburgh, and took the black Tcft. That eighthe lectured on Amos vii. “ And 1 will fet a plumb line inthe raidft of my people Ifrad.” He cried out, Oh ! howfew of the minifters of Scotland will anfwer the plumb-line? Lord, fend us * We; wood, a Cargil, and a Cameron,and fuch as they, and make us quit cf the reft. “ And Iwill ri 'e againft the boufe of Jeroboam with the fword.”Pie faid, ,1 will tell ycu gcodnew^, our Lord will takea feather out of Antichrift’s wing, which fhai! bring dowathe Ouke of York, and bsnifh him out of thefe kingdoms,and w:M remove the bloodv fword from above the beadsof his people ; And there will never a man of the nameof Stewart fit upon the throne of Britain after the Dukeof York, whofe reign is now ftiort, for their lechery,treachery, tyranny, and fheddiug the precious blood ofthe Lcrd’s people: But, oh ! black, black, black will theday be that will come upon Ir eland l fo, ihat one may tra¬vail 40 miles, and not fee a reeking boufe, nor bear acockcrow. At this he ftarteri up to his feet, and ciapt his hands,and with a raviftiing voice cried aloud, Glory, glory tothe Lord, that has accepted a bloody lacrifice of a fealedttftimony off Scotland’s hand ! We have a bloody cloutto held up, and the lads that got the bullets through theirheads the laft day at Glentrol; their blood has made-theclout redder. When cur Lord looks on the bloody clout,he will keep the fword of his avenging juftice in tbefheath( 24 )for a time ; but if Scotland fi a’l cot,consider the mercifulday of their visitation, nor Ms iong-fuft'ering, patience,and forbearance brad them to repenta'nd^ as we fear itwill not, but harden them in their fin, and the greater partturn gofpel proof and judgment-proof, and wax worfeand Worfe, then Will the Lord accomplifh all that he hasthreatened his weil-deferred, forefee’n and foretold dayof vengeance: When he begins, be 'will m ke an endcfp?cla'!y again'ft the houfe of Eli, for the iniquity whichthey cannot 6ut know. When ended, he, and thofe thatwere vvith him, hy down in the Sheep houfe, and. gotfonie Sleep : He rofe early, and went up to the burn-fide,and Stayed Song * when he came in to them, he gave outthe 3ad.

Theforelavd Jimss Cubifon went eight pallet with him; w.jenhe took good night, he faid, Sir, I think Til never fee youagain He anfwered, James, you apd I will never meetagain in time, And two fevcral times he went to Irelandbefore, when they parted, he told them that they wouldmeet again. The faid James, John. Muirbead, and otherfufferers, who were prefsat, gave me thefe accounts.28. Shortly after they landed from Ireland in Gallo-tyay, the'eriemy got notice, they being thifn in garrifons,foot and horfe, and it being killing time, the alarm came( 2J )to them m a morning, that foot and horfe were comingupon them, the forefaid John Mu'uhead being ftrnck witha violent pain in his forehead, they ftarted up to run forit: He fdd, Stay, fi»y lade! let us pray for old John trewe go. Ke Rood up and faid, Lord, we hear tell that thyenemies and ours are conrng up m ua, and thou haft laidthy hand of affliftion on old John ; have pity upon him,for thy enemies will hare none ; his blood will run wherehe lies! fpare him at this time, we know not if he be readyto die. And, as John told me, with tears in his eyes, thepain in h s head, and the indifpofition of his body quiteleft him, and he darted up and ran with the reft. Theenemies feeing them, pu-fued them hard, fometimes thehorfe, and forortimes the foot being near them; mofTy,boggilh ground did caft about the borfes. After they hadrun fome confiderable way, they got upon a little heightbetween the enemy and them : Mr. Peden Rood {till, andfaid, Let us pray here ; fvrr, if the Lord do not bear ourprayers, and fave us, we are dead men, and our blood willrun 1 ke water : If we die, Lt the enemy kill us, let ourblood fill up their cup, that the day of vengeance that iscoming on them n.ay be haftened. Then he began, andfaid, L rn, it is iLy t nen,iet>’ day, hour and power; theymay not be idle, but baft theu uo other work for them,but to fend th-m after us ? Send them after them, towhom thou wilt give ftrength to flee, for our {Length isgone ; twire them about the hill, Lord, and caft the lapt f thy cloak over auld Sandy, and thir poor things, andLve us this one time, and we will k.epit in remembrance,and tell it to the commends'ion of thy goodinefs, pity andcor. pafiion, what th: u didft for us at fuch a time. In themeantime, there was a dark cloud of mift came betwixtthem. After prayer, he ordered two of them to give noticeof the enemy** motion, and the reft to go alone, and crynughtily to the Lord for deliverance. In the meantimethat they weie thus txerciied, there came pefts to theenemy, for them to go and pursue after Mr. Renwick,apd a great company whfc him. After tfic cacmiea werec( >s )pf»n«, he called them tegeth i and faid, Let ua not forgetto return th ink* to the Lori, for hearing and anfweringU3 in the day of our diftrefs, And charged the wholecreation to praise the Lord ; and also adjured the cloudstopraifehim.

It beittg a yen' depart place, vhere never visual grew,and far from neighbours, it was fame time before auy oftheir frtends came to her: The first that came, was avery fit hand, that old fingular Woman, in the C"mmsp'r( 32 )h^.d, named Elasibeth MenzicS, three m:!e*<i»Uat> whohid b.'en tried with the violent death of her hiUbandat Pe-idand, af'erward^ of two worthy tons, ThomasWeir, who was killed-at Drumclog, and David 5teel,who was fuddenly foot afterwards when taie^.

After this, two days before Argyle was brokenand uken, be war near Wigtown in Galloway ; a con¬siderable nutnbrr of men were gathered together in arms,to go for his asaisavace they pressed him to preach, buthe positively refused, and slid, be.would.only pray withthem : whe'e he continued long, and spent some part afthat time in praying for Ireland, pleading that the Lordwould spare a remnant, and not make a full end in theday of his anger; and would ‘•put it in the hearts of hisown to fiei over to this bloody land, where they wouldfind safety for a time. After prayer, they got some meat,and he gave every one of his old parishonersj who werethere, a piece out tf his own hand, calling them his bairns.Then he advised all to go no further : But, said he, foryou that are my bairns, I discharge you to go your foot-length, for, before you can travel that length, he will bebroke: and though it were not so, God will honourneither him nor Monmouth to be instruments of a goodturn to his church, they hav« dipt their hands so far inthe peesecutioa. And the same day that Argyte wastaken, Mr- George Barclay was preaching, and persaad-irg the men in that country to go to Argyll assistance:After Serai m, he said to Mr, George, Now Argy’e is inthe enemy’s hand, and gone ! Tho’ he was many milesdiit^nr. I hfd thii account from some of these his bairns,who were present j ard thelast from Mr. Barclay’s felf.J9-':Vfter thir he was to preach at night at Pcrgarocb,fn Cerri k : but the mistress cf the house was too open-minded to a woman, who went and toki the eremy, andSame bar1: to the house, that she might not be suspended:Mr. Peden beijig in the fields, came in haste to the door,and called the mistress, and said. Ye have played a bonny(port t;< you1 self, by being too.loore tongped ; nr-y theenemy is informed that 1 was to drop ?. word this nightn this house, and the person who has done it, is in theicuse just now, and you will repent it j for to tnbrrbvv7( 34.)morning the enem? will be bere. Farewel, I w: 1 stayno longer in this place. To morrow morning both footand borge were about the house.40. Ta the same year, within the bounds or Carnes,John Cla-k, in Muirbro'k, being with him, slid,Sir, whatthink ye of thia present time ? Is it not a dark, melancholyday? And can there be a more discouraging tme thanthis? Lie said. Yes, John, this i» indeed a dark, discou.raging time; but there will be a darker time than .hii.These silly, graceless, wretched creaturca the Curates,shall go down; and after them shall arise a party callvdPresbyterians, having no more than the name ; and .^e.eshall as really crucify Christ, as ever he was cruciuedwithout the gates of Jerusalem, upon Mount-Calvary,bodily; I say, they shall as really crucify Christ, m biscause and interest ia Scotland ; and shall lay him in h:3grave, and his friends shall give him his wind ng sheet,and he shallif, as one buried, for aconsid'nble time.O then, John, there will be darkness and dark days, suchas the poor Church of Scotland never srw the like of them,nor shall see, if once they were ever ! Yea, John, they-shall be so dark, that if a poor thing would go betweenthe East tea bank aud the West, sea bank, cerkiog a mini¬ster, to wh .m they would conmiun catc tbdr case, ortell them the a»i«d of the L td, concerning the tiroes, heshil not find one. Jobs asked him where the testimonyshould be then ? Me answered, To the feanua o* a fe .v, ^ ‘t°!shall be despised and undervalued by all, butespeua,,/by these ministers who buried Chr,s 1 But at" 1 tba,,shad get up on them : and, at the crack of U;a wir.ding-shCet, as many of them as are alive, who were at his burial,shall oe d etracted aud mad for fear, not knowing whatto do. Then, John, there shall be btave days, such asthe Church of Scotland .never .aaw ihe like ! But I shad <Dot see them, but you may,-(.35 )^r. In the same year 16S-5, he wsg preachicg in thenight-time in a barn at Garrick, cn that text, Paal.’xxxvi. 1.“ Let God arite ! and let his enemies be scattered 1 Letthem that hate him flee before him ! As smoke is driven,sb drive thou them !” So insisting how the enemies andhaters of God and goodness were tofs#d and driven asemoke or chaff by ’ae wind of God’s vengeance, while onejr'h ; and that wind would b!ow them all to hell in theend Stooping down, there being chaff among hts feet,he took a handful of it, and said The Duke of York, andnow King of Britain, a known enemy of God and gopd~ness, it was by the vengeance of Gi>d that he ever got thatname ; bm, as you see me throw away that chaff, so thewind of that vengeance shall blow and drive him off thatthrone; and he, oor any of that namg, shall ever comeon it again.41. About this time, when preaching in Garrick, inthe parish of Girvan, in the day-time, it) the fields, oneDavid Mason, then a professor, came in haaie, 1 ramplingon the people, to be near him; he said. There comes .hedevil's rattling bag, we do not want him here After this,the said David became officer in that bounds, and an in¬former, running thro’ rattling hie bag, and sutnmoriingthe people to their unhappy Courts, for their non confor¬mity j for that, he, and his, gat the name or the devil’srattle bag to this day. Since the Revolution, he com¬plained to his minister, that he and hie got that name;the minister said, Ye well deserve it, and he was an honestmsn that gave it you; you arid ycur'e must enjoy it,there is no help for it.43. A’little before hie death, he was in Auobindeicb,where be was born, in the house of John Richraan; therebeing two bedr in the room, one for him, and one forAndrew , who dwelt in and about the New-milns ;when Andrew was going to his bed, he beard him vet yimportunate with the Lord, to have pHy upon the West( 3<> )of ScollaiJ, aad spare a remnant, and not make a fall endin the day of his anger : And when he was off his knees,he walked up and down the chamber, crying ont, Ob !the monales, the French rnor.fciee f See how they run iHow long will they run ? Lord cut their houghs and staytheir rannbg. Thus he continued all night, some timesoa his knees, and some times walking: In the morningthe enquired what he hneant by the tnonzies ? He said}O sirs! ye will h?ve a dreadful day by the French morzies,and a set of wicked tnen ia these hnds, who will take partwith them r The'West of Scotland will pay dear for it.They v ill.ruo thicker on the *?,ter ct Ayr and Clyde, thanf7er the Highlandmeri did. I lay in that chamber aboutthree years ago, and the said John Richman and his wifetold. me thU the9e were his wo-ds. At other times, tothe same purposef saying, O ! the mar.zles, the monzieswill be through the breadth and length of the South andWest of Scotland! O! I tain r I see them at our fife sMes,claying man, wife and children. The remnant will geta breathing, but they will be driven to the wildernessagain, and their sharpest hours wii! be last. To the samepurpose spoke the two following ministers, Mr. ThoniSsLuodiej a godly minisier in the north of Rotray. Hiasister, a lady in that cou itry, who died in 'he year 1683,gave the following account: That the said ?*Ir. Lundie,after some sickness and seeming recovery again, whichcomforted them, one morning staying longer than ordi¬nary in his chamber, the foresaid !?.dy knocked at hischamber door; on opening it, found him more than ordi¬nary weighted : Che asked him the reason, seeing he wasnow better ? Whereupon, smiling, he said, Within a fewhours I will be taken from you ! But alas! for the daythat I see coming upon Scotland; tne Lord has letten mssee the Frenches marching with their armies throughthe breadth and length of the land, marching to theirbridle-reins in the b ood of ail racks, and that forabroken, burnt and buried covenant! But neitber ye nor Iwill live to see it. As also, one Mr. Douglas, a godlyC 37 )minister in Galway, a little beforeas slumbering in hie bed, bn wife and other friers stand:,ng by, wnen he awakened, heieemrd more than ordinaryweighted, nadgToaned heavily, r«yiog, gad Jay9f0T Scot-1M; F.S wdc asked htta What will be the indumenta ?He sa.u, » s»ords of foreign enemies: Taer will beheavy and sharp, but not long; but they wid oa be vetbut n^ long to lb;m.

When the day of Lis death drew near, and notbeing able to travel, he came to bis brother’s house, iathe parish of Sorn, where he was born ; and caused diga cave, with a saaghen bush covering the mouth of it,i near to his brother’s house: and the enemies came andsearched the house narrowly many times. la the timethat he was in this cave, he said to some friends, j. ThatGod shall make Scotland a desolation, j. There shall be. a remnant in the lani, whom God should spare aud hide3. They should lie in holes and caves of the earth, and be1 sapplied with meat and drink : And when tbey come out1 of their boles, they shall not have freedom to walk, for1 stumbling on the dead corpses! 4.

Me should geta gre t fall from a horse. / a. He should fall in adu’tery.3- Int> theft; and for this, he should leave the land.<• Make a melaucholy end, abroad far murder. Whichaccordingly came to pass There was one Murdoch,3 mason to h s trade, but then in the military service,Who first put hands to his corpse. A little before hiadeath he said. Ye shall be angry where I shall be buriedat last, but f discharge you all, to lift my corpse again.At last, one morning early, he came to-the door, and leftMs cave; hia brother’s Wife said, AVbere are you going ?the enemy will be here. He said, I know that. Alas 1Sir, said she, what will became ofyou ? You must go backto the cave again. He said, I hare done with that, for itfa discovered r but there is no matter, fur', within forty-eight hours, I wiii be beyond lift? reach of all the devil’stemptation?, and hb instruments, ia hell o-V on the earth ;and they shall trouble me n® more.

Look down to bell, whereyou ai e going ; the devil has a fait grip of yon, and willnot lose it." That woman lived and died under thetftaln fa?na of a witch, and presumptions of the same.a. About the year 1670, he was in Armagh in Ireland.One John Goodale with his wife, two serious zealousChristians living in Armagh, who had gone from Scotland,who was a wheel-wright to his employment; his zealwas such against the superstitious worship and keepingto many holy days, that when the people were going andcoming by his shop door he wrought most hard, forwd.cq he was excommunicated: When he told Mr.Peden,he said, “ Rejoice John that you are cast out of the devil’*coum-book” After this, he was preaching privatelyin J hn’s house; in his preface he said, “ Our Lord hasbeen taking great pains on you in Ireland, to gel youto learn your lesson per quire; and few of you have beenbrought to say your ksuga off the book. He has gotr( 44 )t-goodly comply in Scotland that he is learning to eaytheir lessen off the book, and they are brave scholars:But ere long be will try sora? of you with it also. Kewill say, Come out thou man in Armah., and thou manin Bcnburb, and say your knson off the book.” TheBishop of Aitr.ah (whereof the great Mr. Usher wasformerly Bishop) and bis underling was so enraged againstthe said John that he r-*te twenty niile? to D jbHn, to getan order of Cap‘ioa from the Lord Lieutenant there,for apprehending the said jo ho. and also George FJeemingin Btnbutb, which he easily obtained, and came quickly;back, and was in such haste to deliver bia order, thatupon horseback he called for the Aief magistrate; Wbettdelivering bis commi -s.on, his horse cast up his head andgave him ssch a-stroke on the breast that bedied the 4th.or 5tb. day thereafter. George Fleeming went out cfthe way, who was father to the late Mrs Fleemiog, thatChristian motherly woman wao kept a school in theCastle-hill and died there. The aforesaid John w,s im¬mediately puv in prison: His wife and other friends cameto v.sit him ; his wife said, “ Now my clear, iearn to sayyour lesson off the book” He answered, “lam muchobliged to you for your kindne.-s, that mind* me of thatnote.” The Jaylor at night, said,* John, you are calledan honest man, if you will premia to re urn to m rrow,1 will let yon home to your bed.” John said, “ That1 will J»Ot do,” The Keeper said, “ Will you rgn for it ?”He said, *‘ No, no ; I have done no ill thing that needsmake me either afraid or ashamed Well, said theKeeper, go home to your bed. and I will send a servantfor you the mofrow’s morning- When he went h-me,at family worship be fang the following line* id the icytb.JJs&lro,Few be his days, and in bis roomilia charge^nother take, &e.( 45 )When ended he said to his wife, I never fcmd eucb a gafeupon my s-pi.it as in the singing of these lines. She saidit was so with her also. Weil, said he, let us commitcur case and cause to the Lord, and wad on Lim, andwe shall know the nearing of this afterwards. Theunhappy man fell immediately ill> and said that all thisr • sebief had come upon him lor what he had done againstJohn Goodale; and caused write and signed a dischargeand sent it to the said John, that he might not be troubledfor the expence he bad been at in getting of that caption.He died under great horror of conHience 1 Notwith¬standing John was detained three years prisoner, workingat his employment in the Tolbooth in the day-time, butgot home to his bed at night. The said John and biswife returned to Scotland, and died since the Revolution.His wife whin dying at Leith gave this relation.3. When Mr Pcden was prisoner in Edinburgh,coder sentence of banishment, James Millar, merchantin Kirkcaldy, was under the same sentence, and his wife<aisie to visit him; Mr. Peden said to her, It is no wosderyou be troubled with your husband’s going to the planta¬tions, bat if any of us go there at this time the Lord neveripake by me.4. In their voyage to London they had the opportuaityto command the Sh p and make thtir escape, but wouldjjpt adventure upon it without his advice: He said. Letalone, for the Lord will set u« all at liberty in a way morefor bis own glory and our safety.5 About tb’s lime, ,cn their voyage, on t^e S-bbaththe prisoners pressed him to preach,, the wmd blowingvery haul: in that Sermon he said, Up .yviir hearts lads.and be not discouraged, for this man thought he had gota prize when he got the giit of us from the wicked bloodyCouncil; but in s few dsys he shall be as glad to be quitI( 46 )ef ua as e«r he was to get us. A little time ag« I bada loog scroll p^mapy accounts about Mr. Peden froman old Christiau KnglUh gpntlem.n, who was much infiis company, and gave me many Notes of his Sermons •and asserted the truth of many things I have said abouthim that he was witness to, and some other persons ofgreat integiity. He assured me, the only instrument theLord raised up for the relief of Mr. Peden and the othersix prisoners with him was Lord Shaftesbury, who wasalways friendly to Presbyterians: He went to Charles II.and upon his knees begged the release ef these prisoner*but could not prevail Then he went to the master ofthe Ship and told him that if he did not set these prisonersat liberty hr should never sail in Englbh seas. At lengthhe came down to Gravesend and set them at liberty.After that the Scots and English shewed more than ordi¬nary kindoefs to them, which should be kept in remem-braace, with thanksgiving to the Lord, for fsTcnrinjr «uroutcasts, 6 wur«. After they were set at liberty he slaved st Londonand through England until June s6r9. Upon the aid.of June he was come to the south m Scotland, beingSaturday the day before the Lord’s people fell and fledbefore the enemy at Bothwel bridge, la hi8 exercise ina family he cried out, I will tell you sirs, our deliverancewill never come by the sword : many thought when theBishops were first set up that they would not continueBeven years, but I was never of that mind ; it is now nearthree gevens, bat they wdl not see the fourth seven, butl fear they will come near toi'. Which sadly came to pass.7. He went th.r-- ight to the fields, and came in onthe Sabbath-morning about the Sun rising Weeping andwringing his hands ! One John Simpson, a godly man,enquirea what the matter wis that made him weep ? Hesaid, I have been wrestling all night with God, for o'urfriends that are iu the west, but cannot prevail 1 gavean account in the former pasrages, about the middle ofthat day many people were waiting for Sermon ; when! ®on;e to]d he eaid. Let P«ple go to their prayerstor t can preach Bone; our friends are all fled and faileabefore the enemy, and they are bagging and hashing themdown, and their blood is running like water! At nighthe was called to supper, having ta ted nothing that day,! tcveral frirnds being present; in teekiog a blessing he1 broke out m a rapture of weeping and lamentations forthat sad stroke upoij the bodies of the Lord’s people; buti much more for the dead-stroke the greatest part had gotupon their spirits, that few of the ministers and professors': of Scotland should ever recover ; which sadly held true,I as I formerly mentioned in the scrape* of writings of that: bla.t oOast withering wind. He also insisted in prayerI f°r 'he wounded, who were wallowing to death in their(blood; and for tite many prisoners. When ended, hei went off and all others without tasting of their suppertho’ it was upon the table. At this time he was forty ori fifty miles distant from Bothwel-bridgeAbout this tirpe be was preaching in the south oni that tpjtt, ‘.But they.ate notgrieved for the affliftii ns 0*1 Joseph.’ He, had many edifying remarks upon the pre-: ceding verses, especially upon that; ‘ Wo unto them thati arp.at.ease iqr«Sfon<J He insisted uoon the True nature of; grieving ; and lamented that there was so little grievingi for the present great afflictions of the Church of Scotland.- One woman standing amongft the people, pointing to herhe said, ^Somc of you will grieve and greet more for thedrowning of a bit of a calf or stirk than ever ye did for alltb£ tyranny and defedfions of Scotland.

Peter Aird,who lived in the parish of Galstoun, who was taken w.thme, and imprisoned together, told me that he lo.lowedhim some coed piece of the way to detain him untd begot his child baptized ; He said, I resolve to comebackshortly, and I hope the Lord will preserve your child.Which accordingly he did: And after baptism he said toPeter, if the man of the parish (Mr. James Veitcb, one ofthe actually indulged) had baptized ycur child, you wouldhave got vour horned beasts kept, and now you will Josethem. Which came to pass in a few days after. Theenemy came and took away his cattle every hocf, but hefled with bis horses.io In the same year i6$z, he married John Kirklandand fanet Lindsay, both my very acquaintances, who toldme,‘that when they were standing before him, he e gheddeeply and said, First one husband killed, and then ano¬ther, anp must have a third ! If it must be so, let ber say.Good is the will of the Lord ! Which did come to pass.Her husband, Thomas Weir in Cumberbead, was deadlywounded at Drumdog by Claverhcuse. the first day ofJan; 1679, being the Sabbath day, and died the fifth day;aad Ensign John Kirkland was ki ted in Flanders. Kers-Und Fullerton and he were ail buried in one grave; andsince, William Spence, Raillie in Coulter, who also wasnvy intimate acquaintance, married her. They are bothbow in their graces.( 49 )ii. In the year 1684 be was in Ireland, io the houseof John Slowan, in the parish of Conert, in the countyof Antrim. About ten o’clock at night, fitting at thefire side, discoursing with some people, he started to bisfeet and said, Flee auld Sandie and h de yourself, forColonel *— is coming to this house to apprehend you ;and I advise you all to do the like, for they will be herewithin an hour. Which came to pass. And when they1 had made a very narrow search within and without the[ bouse, and went round the thorn bush under which he> was lying praying, they went off without their prey. He1 came in and said, And has this gentleman (designing himI by his name) given poor Sandie and thir poor things fucita fright ? For this night’s work God shall give him fucha blow within a few days that all the physicians on earthshall not be able to cure it. Which came to pass; for hedied in great misery, vermin flowing from all the parts ofhis body, Mitb such a noisome stink that few could enterthe 100m wheie he lay.sa. About the same time he was in the same parishand county. One Mr, David Cunn.ngbam, minister there,in the meeting house on a Sabbath day broke out in verygreat rtflt&ions on Mr Ptdrn and those that heard hina>One Mr. Vtrnor, one of Mr. Cunningham’s elders, wasvery much offended at the same He told Mr. Peden oaMonday what Mr. Cun Inglum had said. Mr. Pedtn,walking in his garden, took a turn about and came backand charged him to go and tell Mi. Cunningham from himthat before Saturday’s night he should be as free of ameeting-house as he was; which came to pass, for hewas charged that same week not to enter bis meeting¬house under the pain of oeath This account i« givenby ne John M'George in the parish of OrHn Galloway,who was there present.E( 5° )ij. About tbc same time fcc was in the bouse of theforesaid John Slowao, who was a great friend to ourScots Sufferers who fled there from the persecution here,93 I have heard John Muirhead and others give account.His son John Slowan, gave me this and several otherdistina accounts. The foresaid Mr. Cunningham carriedover miny of the Reviews of the History of the Indulgenceto spread in Ireland, in defence of the Indulgence here.When Mr. Peden heard of them, he said to some friends.Be not discouraged, for there Socks will do hurt in thiscountry, for I saw the sale of them spilt this last night.And ep it came to pass, for the most of them was returnedto Scotland.14. He was preaching on a Sabbath-night in the saidJohn Slowan’s house, and a great nund'er both withinand without hearing him ; whfe be insisted on the greatneed and usefulness of seeking and getting spiritual riches.He brought in this example, That if any man was goingto Belfast or Bellimony, he would be looking his pocketsfor what he had to bear bis charges. One man standingwithout, said quietly. Lord help me, for I have nothingto bear mine. Mr. Peden said immediately, pointing tothe door. Poor xjian do not fear, for I have it frotn he avenas with an audible voice, thy charges snail be borne, andthat in a remarkable manner. Tbit man has been verymercifully and remarkably eupportec ever since, and thatin the way of his duty.Jo the same place, in a Sabbath-morning’s family-worsh’p. he sang Ps?!m xi 11. He said. Sirs, l charge youto sing this Psalm in faith, for we will ha»e a room-thronebelive. some one hath given him a deadly blow, thoughppor Monmouth bath no hand in it- A fowler, when beshoots a bird, it m-ty rise and flee, but not fat. for there issome of the shot in it. Within ten days after, the newsof Charles ad'a death was confirmed.( 51 )16. About the same time he said to James Slowan,We muft go to another house this night, for I am mi takenif there be not a very narrow search made this night.They went to William Craig’s, and James went withthem to the house, and returned to his own bed. Whenhe awaked, the hou e was full of people, Constables andothers, making search for prisoners who had broke prisonand were Ced, but found none.17. Mr's. Maxwel, or Mary Elphingston, yet alive,whom 1 mentioned in the former passages, whose heart sthoughts Mr. Peden told, when her child was baptized sthat child is now a married woman, and has children ofher own, whom I spoke with about three months ago.She came far (from Kilmarnock) to public occasions,about fifty miles distance. Mrs. Maxwel told me since,when last in Glasgow, that when she told me that, sheforgot to tell me also, that when the child was in herfather’s arms, Mr Peden said, That child’s coming hereat this time, is a tes.'.mo&y against the unfaithfulness ofthe ministers of Ireland. Ireland thinks that Carolinain America will be a refuge for them; but, as the Lordlives, it shall be no shelter them. And these of themdesigning to go there at this time, many of them shalllose their lives, and the rest of them sha'i come home iagreat distress. Aad at that time there were two Shipssetting out from Ireland to Carolina, one of them wasoast away near Carolina, and seven score cf people in her»the one half of them was lost. Mr James Brown, oneof the ministers of Glasgow since the Revolution, was onecf the seventy who were preserved. The other Ship wasdriven back to Ireland, shattered and disabled, and thejvcvp'e greatly distressed.18. One time travelling himsdf alone in Ireland, thenight came oa, and a daik mist, which obliged him to gointo a house belonging to a Quaker t Mr. Pedea said,I must beg the favour of the roof of yoar house all eight.JEz( 5- )The Quaker eaid, Thou art a stranger, thou art verywelcome, and shait be kindly entertained ; but I cannotwait upon thee, for I am going to the meeting Mr, Pedensaid, I will go along with you. The Quaker said, Thoumay, if thou pkase j but thou roust not trouble u*. Hesaid, I will be civil Wtun they came to tde meeting,as their ordinary is they sat for some time silent, somewith their faces to the wall, aod others covered. Therebeing a void in the loft above them, there came downthe appearance of a raven, and sat upon one man's head,who started i>p immediately, and spoke with such vehe¬mence that the froth flew from his mouth : It went toa second, and he did the satn't ; and to a third, who didas the former two. Mr. Peden sitting near to his landlord,said, Do you not see that ? Ye will not deny it afterwards ?When they dismissed, going home, Mr. Peden said to bislandlord, I always thought there was devilry among you,but never thought that bever thought he did appetr visiblyamong you till now that 1 have seen it- O ! for the Lord’ssake quite this way, and flee to the Lord jtscs, in whomthere is redemption, through his blood, even the forgive¬ness of all your iniquities. The poor man fell a weeping,and said, I perceive that God hath sent you to my home,and put it in your heart to go along with me, and permit¬ted the devil to appear vi ibly among us this night! I neversaw the like before. Let me have the help of your prayers,for I resolve, thro* the Lord’s grace, to follow this waynodonger. After this, be breame a singular Christian ;and, when he was dving, blersed the Lord that in mercysent the maa of God to h:* house.19. There is an old Cbristhn woman living it, theWater of Leith, that in the beginning of 1685 wentto Ireland, to the foresajd panab of Copert (being bigwith child) to an aunt’s house, who lived there : Shortlyafter, she was safely delivered, and Mr Peden baptisedher child After she was recovered she went on a S lb-bath-morning to the foresaid John Slowan’s house (where( S3 }Mr. Pc Jen wa&) expert, ng Sermo»: t’acrt being siiow,the and others sat down in the kitchen at the fire-tide;then Mr. Peden came and called forwa.tr (owathi.ithands: When he saw them, he said, For what do >oticome here, without you Lad been advertised ? for 1 haveliothing prepared ior you. They said. 0 Sir you mustnot send ss away empty, for we are in a starving condi¬tion. lie said, I caoaoi promise you; tu. if J can getany thing, ye shall not want it. A little while thereafter,be called aad said, Let cot th.se people away, for 1 will• come to them sbor.ly. Waicb he did, and preached: upon that Ux:, “The day being forspent, they cocsttaiuedij h.m to tarry all night.“ Where he broke out in s. rangeraptures, expressing his fears of the Lord’s departure fromthese lands. lie said, England for superstition apd pr 3-l faaity, Ireland for security and formality, great shall thyi stroke be ! For, in a few years, ye may travel f vty tnixsE in Ireland, and n.,t get a light to your pipe ! Which eacaeto pass four years thereafter, in the list rebellion, liesaid also, O Scotland ! many, long and great shall thyjudgments be, of all kind;, especially the West and South,: far loathing and contempt of the gospel, covenant break-j ing, burning and burying, and shedding of innocent) pre-j clous dear fel rod ! OS all ye that cac pray, tell ad thei Lord’s people to try, by mourning and prayer, to teagle! bim. O! see if ye can teagle him, teagle him, tesglc him,j especially in Scotland; for we fear he w ill depart from it.!’ When ended, he said, Take ye that among you, and makea good use of it; for I have gotten it new and fiesfc cutof heaven, having nothing of it this morning. The fore-said John Muirhead, and the said old woman, and others*told me, they were never witnesses to such a day, for manytears, both from preaehere and hearers-*o. After this, this old woman longed to be home tnScotland, her husband (whose name was Pator) being iaKiager, aud hea.iog of such a killing in Scotland; bdayg^ 3   - - ,       -    ( 54 )the ysw 16*5, one of the bioody ye*r‘, npon scaifoldit9nd in t^e tkliift (and indeed the dm wat. uo greater thanthe deed), a bark being to go off with p i68erigera,g sheresolving to go along, went to take her leave of Mr. Peden,2nd found him in a wood with J< bn Muirbea.i, and othersof cur Scots sulTcrere. She told him her design, and hemooed a little, and then aaid, Go not away tid I speakwith you. He lock a turn tnrough the wned, and whenhe came back, he said, Janet, go back to your aunt’s,for you will not ere Scotland these five months; the ewill strange things go through Scotland ere you go to it,you will see a remarkable providence in your being etopt.The bark went off, and was cast away, and 1 j passengers’corpse were cast odt at the place where they took ship;John Muirfaead gave me this account also.ai. Ader he came to Scotland, in the beginning ofMarch 1685, flying trom the enemy on horseback, andthey pursuing, he was forced to ride a water, where hewas in great danger of being lost: When be get out, hecried. Lads follow not me, for I assure you ye want myboat, and so will certainly drown. Consider where yourlanding wdl be ! ye are fighting for hell, and running postto it, Wnicfe affrighted them to enter the water.aa At another time, being hard pursued, he wasforced to take a dangerous bog and a moss before him :One of the Dragoons nmre forward than the rest, runhimself into the bog, and he and his horse were never#eeo mota.•aj. Lying sick in a village near Cumnock, he told hislandlord who was afraid to keep him in his house, hesokiicra being to travel thro* that town the next day.Ye need not fear to let me stay in your house, for sctr.cof these soldiers shall keep Gentry at this door, but shallnot conre in. Which came to pass.

VVtbcb they did.14- He lying tick about tbe same lime, his landlordwas aiiaid to ke p him in his houce. The enemy beingin search of hiding people, he was obliged to make a bedfor him among the stand ng corn ; at which time tb«re1 wa a great rising of the wa er, but not one drop to bei observed within Uu foot ot his bed.ay- About this time he came to Garfield, in the p ;rith! of Mauchiin, to the house of Matthew Hog, a smith.1 He went to hi* barn, but thought hirmelt rot safe, footI and horse of the enemy being starching for wanderers,I as they were then called. He dtfured the favour of bis'' loft, which Matthew refuted : He eaid. Well, well, poorru&fi, you will not let me have the siieiter of your roof;but that ■bouse shall be your ju dgment and ruin. Sometime after, the gavel of that house fell, and fcrlfed both himaad his son ! Their bodies were severely crushed.i6. About the same time he came to Andrew Nor-t mand’s house, in the parish of Alloway, and shire of Ayr,c being to preach at night in his barn. After he came iu,a he halted a little, leaning on a chair-back, with his face3 covered. When fcc lifted up his head, he said, They are| in this house that I have not one word of salvation unto 1i He halted a little again, saying, This is strange that thel devil will not go out, that we may begin our work! ThenI there was a woman went out, ill looked upon for a witch.J John Muirhead {formerly mentioned) told me. that whenthe came from Ireland to Galloway, he was at familj-< worship, and giving some not's upon the Scripture read,Sthere was a very ill-locking man came in and sat downtsritiiia the door. He halted and said. There ij soae bh-t 5'> )*►■•>??? bodyjun now come into this honse, I charge himto go cut, aad not stop my month. The man went off,and he iosisied j but he sa.v him neither come in norgo cut.17. In thit bloody year 16^5, he came to a house iathe shire of Ayr; Captain John Matthisoa and othertwelve of our wanderers being in the house, he said,l.sds ye must go the fields and seek your beds, for theenemy will be here this rnght, and i’ll go to my cave.They said, Some of us will stay with you, for you willweary alone. No, said he, I will not weary. For a sigathat the enemy will be here -this night, a godly eminentChristian man, whom I often heard of, but never saw,tv id come and lie with me this night. Ail which cameto pass; for the men fled, and he entered the cave, andfell asleep; and a little thereafter the sail hiaa cornin''to the family, asked for Mr. Peden, and desired accessto the cave to lie with him When ia bed, he foundMr. Peden slumbering, but in a lirtle he awoke, andnaming toe maa asked hm how he did i The saidiei®came that night, but missed their prey. The neat morn¬ing when these said men returned, he said, Lads it waswell I came to this house yesternight, otherwise you hadbeen among their bloody hands this day.a8. In the said year 1695. he came to Welwoodto Captain John Campbell’s he having escaped out ofCanongate • Tolbooth, in the month of August 16S4.Being in danger every day, he resolved to go to America,*and took farewei of bis friends, and went aboard of a ship’Mr. Peden said to his mother, Mistress what is becomeof John? She said, He is gone to America He said.No, n:>, he is not gone, send for him, for he will never®ee America. Accordingly i was so ; a storm aro e, andbe was in great danger, but was preserved, and yet alive.®9- Since the publishing cf the former passages ofMr Peden’s life and death. 1 received two leiters fromSir Alexander Gordon of Earlstoun, in the year 171$and *726, since gone to his grave, shewing that he wasnot only fully satisfied, but much refreshed with thepassages, requesting me not to delay the publishing ofail that I prppo.ed; aad that fac longed to see then*( 57 )I before be went off the stage j knowing that my day is far1 spent, being long since 1 was his feilow-p-noner, and1 taught him from my own experience, bow to manageI the great weight of irons that was upon his legs; andi wishing tbit all the Lord’s peop'e, who have any zeal| for tbe swcyi-to and sealed testimony, and savoury re-i membracce of the came* of Christ’s slato witnesses^ forI the same, and of the Lord’s signal manifestation^ of his1 faithfulness and a'l-sufficiency to them, in thtT life andi death, would give me all encouragement in such a pieceI of good and great generation work, which may be usefuli and edifying, when he and I would be mouldering inI the dust. For himself, he willingly would, and sstnetimei a-day could, but now being 74 years of age, and 7 yearsi !h imprisonment, and ohea-times in irons, and many1 other troubles thro’ his life, his memory and judgmentwere much broke, and therefore he could make me little( help. Only he remembered, be was once sent from the' Societies in Galloway to Garrick, to call Mr. Peden topreach: When he told him for what end he was come,Mr. Peden went for sotr-e time alone; and when he eamcback, he said, I am sorry, Earlstoun, you are cots? ao farin vain, for 1 cannot answer your desire ; I can get no¬thing to say to your people : Nothing will convince thisgeneration but judgments, and a surprising lump of themupon the West of Scotland. Earletoun said, Sir, youwas once legally ordajned and authorised to preach thegofpel, and the Lord’s people’s call is fofficieDt; I thinkyou are under a temptation cf enthufiafm. Mr. Pedenfiid, he fometimes feared that ; but iince he was drivenfrom his people at Gtenluce, his Master, in mercy ardgoodt efs, gave him more encouragement ; and gave cheinftance, That one time he was cailtd, and refnlv- d, at-dprepared to go, as he thought; bet, when his horl'e wasdrawn, be went into the barn once more, where he w»aftript bare of all h s thoughts, and a c*arke'nav< dampingcloud overwhelmed him, which ftept him And he Sf‘er-waide faw a reir.a kable pr, vidence in it, and need befor it.

Sneak as you can, and fpare not; only1 requeft that your expreffions nfChrii! he fjitabie to yourcxper cnce of him. L ye think Curilr ^ houfc be bare andiil-provid.’d, and harder than ye looked for, allure your*Lives Chrift mindt only to diet you, and not to hungeryou : Our S eward kena when to fpend and when to spare.Chrift knows well whether heaping or ftraiking agrees heftwith our narrow vdEls, for both are alike to him; Sparing J( 59 )Lit! not enrich him, nor will fpending impoTerilh him.jHe thinks it ill-won t’nst i? hoidea off hie people. Graceand glory comes out of CHrfl’s lucky hand. Our veflelsBre but fecklefe, and contain little : His fulnefs is moftftraitned when it wants a vent. It is eafy for Chrift to beHolder, bufy in dividing the fulnefs of his Father’s houfeto his poor friends : He delights not to keep mercy over¬sight. He is the eafieft merchant ever the people of Godgroked wiih : If ye be pleafed with the wares, what of hispraces makes bel for you, he and you will foon fort onIe price; he will fell goods cheap, that ye may fpierr his fhop again ; and he draws all the fale to himfelf.:ounrel yen to go no farther than Chrift. And nowhen it is come to your door, either 'o fin or fuficr,eounfel you to lay your account with fufferitrg ; for anit-ga.e cotniag from any other airth, will be orejudicial1 your foul’s intereft. And for your encouragement,member he feuds none a warfsie on their own charges,nd bteft is the man that gives Chrift all his rboney. Itill be bet. with you to block with him, when you want■band money. And the let's you have, he has the mureheart to truft you. And fo it Is beft with you to keep inwith your old acquaintance Chrift. New acquaintancewith Grange lords, is ti e ready way to make a wound ingrace’s fide, which will not heal in hafte; the fore mayclofe before the wound dry up, for grace is a tender place,and is very eafily d'ftempered with the backfiidings ofour prefect time. And if the whee's of it be once brokenwith fin, all the money in the world will pot make it to goabout, until it be put in Chrift’s hand. I hope I have fat'dmore on this matter than is needful, for T hdve feenithe marks of tendernefs deeply drawn r.n vour carriage.’The fafefl way to fhift the (hr.wer, is to hold out of God’s<,ate, and keep within his doors, until the violence ofithe ftorm begin fo ebb, which is not yet full tide; ChriftIdeals tenderly with his young plants, and waters them oft,sleft they go back; be painful, and lofe not life for theifeeking. Grace, mercy and peace be with you.( 6o )EPITAPHUpon the Martyrs’ MONUMENT in the Grey-Friar'sChurch-yard, Enmburgh.Upon the Head of the Tomb there is the Figure ofan open Btfre cut out, with the e Scripture cita >ons,Rev. vi. 7 lOi II. “ And when he had opened thefifth Seal, I saw under the altar the Souls of them“ that had been siain for the Word of GOD, and for« the Testimony which they held, &c.”—Rxv. vii. 14.Also the following Lines.Ha it passengers, take heed what you do see.This Tomb doth shew for what some men did die jHere lies inter’d the dust of those who stood’Gainst p rjury, resisting unto blood ;Adhering to the Covenants, and LawsEstabh Iting the same ; which was the causeTheir lives were sacrific’d unto the lustOf Prelatists abjur’d.— Fho’ here their dustLies mix’d with murderers, and other crew,Whom Justice did to death pursue ;But as for these, no cause in them was foundWorthy of death, but only they were sound.Constant and stedfast, z alous, witnessingFor the prerogatives of Christ their Ki rg :Which Truths were serl’d by famous Guthrie’s bead,And all along to M-.

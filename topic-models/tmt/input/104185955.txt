I’ll none of thee“ I harbour not thy child.”And fast, amid her fluttering hair,With clenched fist he gripes,And seiz’d a leathern thong, and lash’dHer side with sounding stripes.Her lily skin, so soft and white,He ribb’d with bloody wales ;And thrust her out, though black the night,Though sleet and storm assails.Up the harsh rock, on flinty paths,The maiden had to roam ;On tottering step she grop’d her way,And sought her lover’s home.“ A mother thou hast made of me.Before thou mad’st a wife :For this, upon my tender breast.These livid stripes are rife :6“ Behold.”—And then, with bitter sobs.She sunk upon the floor—“ Make good the evil thou hast wrought;My injur’d name restore.”“ Poor soul; I’ll have thee hous’d and nurs’dThy terrors I lament.Stay here ; we’ll have some further talk—The old one shall repent.”“ I have no time to rest and wait;That saves not my good name:If thou with honest soul hast sworn,0 leave me not to shame ;But at the holy altar beOur union sanctified;Before the people and the priestReceive me for thy bride.”“ Unequal matches must not blotThe honours of my line ;Art thou of wealth or rank for me,To harbour thee as mine ?What’s fit and fair I’ll do for thee ;Shalt yet retain my love—Shalt wed my huntsman—and we’ll thenOur former transports prove.”“ Thy wicked soul, hard-hearted man.May pangs in hell await!Sure, if not suited for thy bride,1 was not for thy mate.7“ Go, seek a spouse of nobler bloodNor God’s just judgments dread—So shall, ere long, some base-born wretchDefile thy marriage bed.Then, traitor, feel how wretched theyIn hopeless shame immerst;Then smite thy forehead on the wall"While horrid curses burst.Roll thy dry eyes in wild despair—Unsooth’d thy grinning woe :Through thy pale temples fire the ball,And sink to fiends below.”Collected, then, she started up,And, through the hissing sleet,Through thorn and brier, through flood and mire,She fled with bleeding feet.“ Where now,” she cry’d, “my gracious God!What refuge have I left?”And reach’d the garden of her home.Of hope in man bereft.On hand and foot she feebly crawl’dBeneath the bower unblest;Where withering leaves and gathering snowPrepar’d her only rest.There rending pains and darting throesAssail’d her shuddering frame ;And from her womb a lovely boy,With wail and weeping came.8Forth from her hair a silver piuWith hasty hand she drew,And press’d against its tender heart,And the sweet babe she slew.Whene’er the act of blood was done,Her soul its guilt abhorr’d :“ My Jesus ! what has been my deed?Have mercy on me, Lord !”With bloody nails, beside the pond.Its shallow grave she tore :“ There rest in God ; there shame and wantThou canst not suffer more :Me vengeance waits. My poor, poor child.Thy wound shall bleed afresh.When ravens from the gallows tearThy mother’s mould’ring flesh.”Hard by the bower her gibbet stands:Her skull is still to show ;It seems to eye the barren grave,Three spans in length below.That is the spot where grows no grass ;Where falls no rain nor dew ;Whence steals along the pond of toadsA hovering fire so blue.And nightly, when the ravens come.Her ghost is seen to glide ;Pursues and tries to quench the flame.And pines the pool beside.

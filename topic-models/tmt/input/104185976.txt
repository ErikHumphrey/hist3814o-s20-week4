I’m a queer little comical soul.And if you’ll believe me, though I think you may see,I’m the lad with the carroty poll.Oh dear ! oh dear ! I fear I shall never get wed ;For indeed you must know* wherever I go,l They laugh at my carroty head.'T’other day I went up to town with young squire,I They said that my head would set Lunnon a fire:i I see’d pratty women, wi’ cheeks like a rose ;I gave one a kiss, but she painted my nose ;I Oh dear! oh dear! I couldn’t I’m sure, for mysold,i Tike the touch of her cheek, if I rubbed for a week,I Get the red from my carroty poll.Oh dear ! oh dear ! a quack in our village one day,i 1 le said that he could, and I said that he should,C omo and take all my carrots away.So he rubb’d and he scrubb’d till my face went awry,] Wi’ some stuff that he called his new patent dye.My hair he turn’d black, and my pockets he drain’d.And I looked like the devil the first day it rain’d.Oh dear ! oh dear ! I war such a transmogrified soul,For my head were as bald, as a pig that is scall’d,And I longed for my carroty poll.Oh dear ! oh dear ! the joy of my heart yoa miknow.Was to see the first sprout of niy hair shooting 01When the carrots began to grow ;And my happiness now has arrived at the top.Because I have got such a glorious crop ;And the lesson I’ve learnt is never to fret,But be always content with whatever I get;Oh dear ! oh dear ! the queer little comical soul,Ever will laud the hands that applaudThe lad with the carroty poll.LAY OF THE MILL:OR THE PLEASURES OF THE PAT-NIGHT.Hey, the merry pay-night,Ho, the merry pay-night *’Tis fun to see how we agree,Upon the merry pay-night;That night we clear the lawin score,And then again begin the splore ;Whilst, drunk as lords, we sit

so cross,’(’ause his son smiled, he wopped the younketThen went and begg’d the farmer’s horse.And off he gallop’d to the banker.8He soon got to the hanker's shop,And there he said—“ Tho’ they he olcl,You know these notes again, so, cup.Change them for soverines of gold.”When they’d paid him ten pounds in cash,He was so pleased at the bright show,He said, “ I hope 'twont make you smash,,But charity ’gins at home, you know.”Quite pleased, he to the inn did spankTo treat him with a mug of yale ;When some one said, the Sovereign BankHad fail’d—or it was like to fail!When he heard this, he in a crackReturn’d to bank with might and main.And said, “ Cup take your soverines back,And just give me my notes again.”When he’d his notes, he did beginTo blow them up, and said, “ You crew !You thought to take a poor man in,But, dang it! d’ye see, I’s cunning as ycYou seem’d dang’d quick your gold to pay.You knew the sovsrine bank was broke ;But I’ve my notes, and so good day,And I to your soverines wish good luck 1”PADDY THE PIPER.When I was a boy in my father’s mud edifice, IjTender and bare as a pig in a sty,Out at the door as I look’d with a steady phiz, ■Who but Pat Murphy the piper came by ? j|J ays Paddy, “ Few play tins music, can yonplay ?”Says I, “ I can’t tell, for I never did try;”He told me that he had a charm,To make his pipes prosily speak.Then squeezed a hag under his arm,And sweetly they set up a squeak :With a farala, larallo loo, och ! honey how he ha -died the drone !And then such a sweet music he blew, ’twould havemelted the heart of a stone.our pipes,’ said I, ‘ Paddy, so nately come overme.Naked I’ll wander wherever it blowsInd if my father should try to recover me.Sure it won’t he by describing my clothes,lie music I hear now, takes hold of my ear now.And leads me all over the world by the nose.’So I follow’d his bagpipe so sweet.And sung, as I leap’d like a frog.Adieu to my family seat.So pleasantly placed in a hog.Vith my farala, laralla, loo, how sweetly he han¬dled the drone !Lnd then such sweet music he blew, ’twould havemelted the heart of a stone.ull five years I follow’d him, nothing could sunderns.Till he one morning had taken a sup,And slipp’d from a bridge in a river just under us,I Souse to the bottom, just like a blind pup.roar’d out, and bawl’d out, and lustily call’d out*‘ O Paddy, my dear, don’t you mean to come up s’He was dead as a nail in a door;—Poor Paddy was laid on the shelf;So I took up his pipes on the shore,And now I’ve set up for myself.With my farala, laralla loo, to be sure I’ve not gotthe knack.To play farala, laralla loo, ay, and bubaroo dideroo' whack.TIPITYWITCHET.This morning very handy.My malady was such,I in my tea took brandy.But took a cup too much.(Hiccups.') tol deBut stop, I

made me quite a show !Such a beauty I did grow, did grow, did growSuch a beauty as I did growI’d red straight hair and goggle-eyes.And such a roggish leer ;A large flat nose, and mouth.That reach’d from ear to ear.Such a beauty, &e.My mammy doated on me.And when my mouth she’d fill.For fear she’d spoil it with a spoon,She fed me with a quill.Such a beauty, 8rc.And when that I could run alone.Stock still I never stood,'Ihe ducks were my companions.As I waddled through the mudSuch a beautyThen 1 learned to he mnsical,And got of songs so pat,I could grunt hass like any pig,Mew treble like a cat.Such a beauty, &c.Then I went to a dancing school.For to be finished there.And they said that I danced a reelAs graceful as a bear.Such a beauty, Jkc.•i " ' 'With a mountebank a candidate,I beat them all quite hollow,And I won this pretty gold-laced hat,By grinning through a collar.Such a beauty, &c.My name is Tommy Herring,As every body knows.And they stick me in the barley-fieldsTo fright away the crows.Such a beauty, &c.THE WEST COUNTRYMAN.There was an old chap who lived down in the west,Inside of a church he never had been ;Ecod ! ’ cried he, ‘ to go I had best,’Just vor to see what’s there to be seenOne Sunday morning he put on his clothes,His very best waistcoat, his coat, and his hat;Then early he to the church door goes,‘ I’ll have the best seat.’ said he, ‘that’s vlat,’13lj Now when tlie sexton Lad open’d the door,In stumped the stareing gaping clown,And like a rude unmannerly boor.In the parson's pulpit set himself down.Quoth he, ‘ This be a very nice place,Here’s a very nice cushion to zit down upon ;And when the volks come, I can see ev’ry face,And also can hear whatever goes on.The clerk and the parson soon did approach.And saw the clown perch’d up in the desk,i Cried the clerk * How dare you thus encroach,Now aren’t you ashamed his rev’rence to vex ?1 The clown he started the clerk to hear,And said, ‘ That Tin ashamed don’t suppose?fil’Tis the parson should be ashamed to appear.With his shirt there hanging out over his clothes.THE COAL HOLE.I am a buxum spree young blade,I never was the least afraidTo kiss a handsome pretty maid,My friends call me a gay soul.The lasses are all fond of me,Because I’m merry, blythe, and free,Damn them that would not marry meThough I were in a Coal HoleI took a spree the other night,I w7ent to see my heart’s delight,Some woman there did me a spite,And that T thought was route droll.4She spill’d my liquor smack’d my face,And bade me for to quit, the place,Yet her damn’d clack would never cease,^ill I went to the Coa* Hole.Not caring for her damn’d prat,Resolving to retaliate,Whatever next should he my fata,And soon I’d make her head roll.Then who came in hut Billy Wright,And we like fools began to fight.We broke the glass put out the light.And we soon found out the Coal Hole.Who to my surprise next came in.Was a gay young coxcomb tall aud slim,And round his hat he’d a gay gold rim.And in his hand a long pole.Says he my lad I charge you this,Put on your clothes and quit the place.Or damn me If I ever ceaseTill I march you to the Coal Hole.Not caring for this cowardly prince,Or as little for his consequence,I bade him stand in his own defenceOr soon I’d make his head roll.Then he went out as quick as thought,The watchman I suppose lie sought,For he more than half a dozen brought,And they inarched me to the Coal Hole.When I went there surprised to view,A number of the female crew,Some dressed in black and some in bin..The sight to me seemed unite droll.15Says they my lad don’t he afraid.Nor any way seem the least dismay’dFor almost every spree young blade,Sometimes comes to the Coal Hole.But since I’m free I’ll no more fight,Nor any way stop out late at night;For to tell the truth I’ve ne’er been right,Since I got such a curs’d roll.Black were my eyes and scrathed my lace.Besides it’s brought me to disgrace.And makes poor Jack for to curse the place,Which people call the Coal Hole.THE LIFE OF A SOLDIER.When I was an infant, gossips would say,I when older, would he a soldier,Rattles and toys I thre w them away;Unless a gun or a sabre.I a younker, up I grew,Saw one day a grand review:Colours flying, set me a dying,To embark in a life so new.CHORUS.Roll drums merrily march away,Soldiers glory, lives in story.His laurels are green, when his locks they are grayiThen huzza for the life of a soldier.Listed—to battle I marched along,Courting danger fear a stranger.Tie cannon beat time to the trumpets song.Which made my heart a hero’s:16Charge our gallant leader cry.On like Lyons then we fly;Blood and thunder, foes knocked under,Then huzza for a victory.Then who so merry as we in a campBattle over live in cover.Care and his cronies are forced to tramp.And all is social pleasure.Then we laugh we quaff we sing,Time goes gaily on the wing ;Smiles of beauty, sweeting duty.Then each private is a king.SAINT PATRICK WAS A GENTLEMAN.Saint Patrick was a gentleman.And came of decent people ;In Dublin town he built a church,And he put upon’t a steeple;His father was O’Callaghan,His mother was O’Brady ;His Aunt was an O’Saugnessy,And his uncle an O’ Grady.Then success to hold St Patrick’s fist.He was a saint so clever ;He gave the snakes and toads a twistAnd banished them for ever.There’s no a mile in Ireland’s isle,Where the durty varment musters,Where’er he put his dear fore footHe murder’d them in clusters.17IThe toads went hop, the frogs went lop,Slap dash into the water,And the bastes commited suicideTo save themselves from slaughter.Then success, &c.Nine hundred thousand vipers blueHe charm’d with sweet discourses,And din’d on them at KiliaiooIn soups and second courses ;When blind-worms crawling in the grassDisgusted all the nation.He gave them a rise, and open’d their eyesTo a sense of their situation.Then success, &c.No wonder that our Irish boysShould be so free and frisky,It was St Patrick taught them firstThe joys of tippling whisky;No wonder that the Saint himselfTo taste it should be willing.For his mother kept a whisky shop,In the town of Enniskillen.Then success, &c.The Wicklow hills are very high,So’s the hill of Howth, sir.But there’s a hill much higher still.Aye, higher than them both, sir;’Twas on the top of this high hillSt Patrick preach’d the sarmint.He drove the frogs into the bogs,And bother’d all the varmint.Then success, &c.18St Patrick has a great regardFor those who came before him.He knew the King of France would needA paddy to restore him ;The Fiench went skipping thro’ the bogs,There hearts crammed full of treason.We’ll send them Paddy WellingtonTo /.rub them to their reason.Then success, &c.THE COBBLER AND GOOSE.A Cobbler lived at york,A merry man was he ;His wife took needle-work,A good kind soul was sheEasy as an old shoeThey pass’d their lives together;And of a piece, ’tis true,Like sole and upper leather.\{Spoken.) They were a happy couple, workedhard, and never grumbled at the times or at eachother,—that’s a rare thing in our days,—while shenimbly employed her needle, he hammered away atthe lapstone, and sungBan ! tan ! tan !The cobbler, bought a goose,And fatted it quite high;Somehow the bird got loose'i'iie day it was to die.Here “ Pegs,” bawl'd out the wife.“ Run after the goose to win her.”19?Goosey she ran for her life,And the cobbler for his dinner.(Spoken.) Away he went, and the boys afteihim, calling out “ Now, cobbler! now, goose;two to one upon Pegs,” Egad ! he almost caughther once, when his foot slipped, and headlong hewent into a sty among a litter of pigs, and only.saved his bacon by leaving the flaps of his jacket inthe old sow’s grinders; but Pegs wasn’t to beabashed ; he followed her through bush and brier,bogs, quagmires, over houses, trees, hedges, ditches,fields, cats, dogs, cocks, hens, cows, bulls, and pigs.At last he knocked down the stall of an old woman,who sold hot apple dumplings, which made a rarescramble for the boys—and what could they do, butsingRan, &c.By the river, he seized her rump.But she got loose with a scream;And he fell in the water plump,While goosey cross’d the stream.So finding the chase no use,He went home in a shiver;Told wifey he had lost the goose.But got a fine duck—in the river.(Spoken) “Oh! wile, wife,” he cned,” I’velad my morning’s wet; the goose has gone a gander-innting. I was thrown out, and had fairly a tum¬ble in, besides leaving half my jacket in pawn inthe piggery; my wildgoose-chase has turned out aJ ick, but no green peas; and as I’m very wet, younay rs well hand us over a drop of|-Ran, &c20THE SAVING WIFE.I took a wife my house to mind.Who misery compares;Cameleon-like, she lives on wind.And treats me with her airs.She tells me wilful waste brings want.And quickly makes us poor;But though of fat I’m cruel scant,I dont waste wilful, sure.I call this wife my saveall, andA thousand pretty names.For, under petticoat command,My whole respect she claims.Yet, oft I silently complainOf shackles that I wear,And think my rib, with heart of pain,A spare-rib I could spare.I ask her for a trifle small,When going on a prank:It costs too much, so nought at allComes from her saving bank.Forsooth ! she's such a stingy wifeShe fears her very' breath,If used too much, would waste her lifeI wish she’d starve—to death.Perchance, I bring a friend to sup,Whose talents I admire:'flie fire is low— she blows me upBefore she blows the fire.21Ah! would she hang herself—bless’d thought!I’d rev’rence not her frown—She’d die ere I assistance brought,I’d fear to cut her down.THERE YOU ARE WITH EYE OUT.Not long ago fra’ Yorkshire townI corned up by the waggonAnd soon in Lunnon war set downAt sign o’ George and Dragon *,But soon fia’ thence I. steer’d, d’yo cce,O’d uncle’s house to pry out.When a chap corned up and said to me—‘ Oh !—there you go with your eye Qut-Of this, d’ye mind, I took no heed.But to o’d uncle’s past on ;When another chap to me, indeed.Corned up just like the last one •He stared at me—I stared at hirn—Good humour then was nigh out.For wi’ a face he bawled so grim,‘ Oh !—there you go with your eye out."If one eye's out, says I, it’s droll.And to me is unknown, sirs ;Put up my hand to find the hole.But found it war not flown, sirs.W hen a third chap cam wi’ grinning faceMy patience quite to try out.And bellow’d out wi’ strange grimace,‘ Oh !—there you go with your eye out.’22What all the world says must be true.To me it seems quite funn-y.When I left home I’m sure I’d two,Tho‘ now it seems but one eye:As those who will not see, are noneSo blind—I’ve heard folks cry out.Now tho’ I see,—folk every one.Still bawl that I’ve an eye out.'T’ account for this affair, egad!It cost my brain much trouble;And I thought I must be drunk or mad.If drunk I did see double:So the next that bawl’d I black’d his face.And made his eye soon fly out;So I cried with a better grace,‘ There you go with your eye out.'But now of Lunnon town I’m sick.So I’ll from Cockney walk sheer.And take this speech that’s quite the kick,Wi’ me now back to Yorkshire.To wed me, Dolly waits, d’ye mind.So to her I will cry out—For she loves me, and love is blind—* Oh !—there you go with your eye out.'YHE SAWYER AND THE LAWYER»To set up a village with tackle for tillage,Jack Carter he took to the saw ;To pluck and to pillage the same little village,Tim. Gordon he took to the law23TTwy angled so pliant for gull and for client.As sharp as a weazel for rats.Till ^viiat with their saw-dust, and what with tbeiilawdust,They blinded the eyes of the flats.Then hey for the sawyer, and hey for the lawyer.Make hay, for its going to rain !A.nd saw’em, and law’em, and work’em, r.nd pnirk-’ein >And at ’em again and again.I Jack brought to the people a bill for the steeple,—I They swore that they wouldn’t be bit;But out of a saw-pit is into a law-pit,—I Tim. tickled them up with a writ.Cried Jack, the saw-rasper, “ I say, neighboulGrasper,We both of us by in the stocks ;s While 1, for my savings, turn blocks into shavings,Yon, lawyer, are shaving the blocks.’5Then hey for the sawyer, &c.Jack frolic’d in clever, and when work was over,Got drunk at the George, for a freak;! But Timothy Gordon, he stood for church-wardepAnd eat himself dead in a week :Jack made him a coffin, hut Timothy off inA loud clap of thunder had flown :When lawyers lie level, he sure that the devilLooks sharp enough after his own.Then hey for the sawyer, &c.4THEY’RE A’ TEASING ME,O wlia is he I loe sao weel ?Wha was my heart an’ a’,0 wha is he ? ’tis sair to tellHe’s o’er the seas awa’,There’s Charlie he’s a sodger lad,And Davie blythe is he,And Willie in his tartan plaid,They’re a’ teasing me.J- # .0 they’re a’ tease teasing.They’re a* teasing mo.They’re a’ tease teasing,0 they’re a teasing me.There’s Carl the chief o’ Daftne glen,And ho has land and store,With flow’ry mead, and shady fen,And siller o’er and o’er.“ Quoth he, sweet lass, I’ll marry thca(Yestreen in yonder shaw,)And thou my ain true bride shall be,And Queen o’ Daftne ha!”O they’re a’ tease, &c.But when my Jamie comes again.Young Carl will then descry,That siller is but empty gain,To hearts nae gowd can buy.My Jamie’s brave, my Jamie’s braw,My Jamie’s a’ to me, -And tho’ his siller store be sma’Yet his I’ll only be.Tor they’re a’ tease, &o.

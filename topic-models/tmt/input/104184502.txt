Thomas Bofton, the yovmgeftof feven children, born 1679, ofcreditable religious parents in the townDunfe, where they had fome heritage ;licenfed to preach 1697, ordained mi-nifter at Simprin, the fmalleft charge of. a country parilli perhaps in Scotland,not being quite ninety examinable per-lons in his time, 1690. Married 1700,to Catharine Brown, of good extra# inthe parifli of Culrols, a gentlewomanof fingular wifdom, and many rare en¬dowments, (by whom he had a goodmany children, of whom two fons andtwo daughters furvive them) tranfpor-ted to Etterick, (one of the remoteR andwildeft places in the fouth of Scotland.)1707. died 1732, near five years be¬fore his fpoufe in the 56th year of hisage.He was of a ftature above themiddle fize, of venerable, amiableafpe#, with his own hair originallyblack, of a ftrong and fruitful genius,( 3 )of a lively imagination, (fuch as af¬fords what is called ready wit, which,inftead of cultivating, he laid under afevere reftraint) of tender affections, aclear and foiid judgment: His tempercandid, modeft, cautious, benevolent,obliging and courteous ; had a naturalaverlion to a .'y thing rude or uncivil inwords or behaviour, and a delicate feel¬ing in cafe of meeting with ought ofthat fort; could be heavy and fevere inhis words when there was juft occafion,or he judged the fame neceflary.He was early called by divine grace,all along afterwards exercifed unto god-linefs, walked indeed with God, in allhis ways daily acknowledging'-him,frequent in folemn extraordinary appli¬cations to Heaven, (namely upon eve¬ry new emergent of duty, difficulty ortrial) followed with evident comfort¬able and confirming teftimonies of di¬vine acceptance and audience *, a dili¬gent judicius obferver, recorder andimprover of the difpenfations of divineprovidence,in connection with the word,his own frame and walk, and confe-quently of great experience in religion :he was accurately and extenfively re¬gardful of the diviuc Uw, in all man-ner of life and converfation (even in ■thi ngs chat efcape the notice of the moll: tpart of Chriftians ) of a tender confer¬ence, carefully watching againft and favoiding the appearance of evil; com-pailionate and fympathizing with the :diltreffed, charitable to the needy, (tothe degree of religioufly letting apart*the tenth of his wordly fubltance year- jj3y for their fupply) a dutiful hufbandan indulgent father; a lincere, a faith¬ful and an affectionate friend ; to whichhe had a particular caff in his temper,which proved a rich bleffing to themwho were favoured with his friendfhip.He was a confiderable fcholar in allthe parts of theological learning, andexcelled in fame of them: what he was jfor a humaniff, (even towards the lat-tef end of his days) his tranflation of vhis own work, on the Hebrew accentu¬ation, into good Roman Latin, will a-bundantly teftify; was well feen in the jGreek; and for the fkill he attained inthe Hebrew, he will, we are fatisfied,in ages to come, be admired, and hadin honour by the learned world; efpe-cially when it is underftood under what "difad vantages,feclufion fromin what obfcnrity iwork was compofed; .and when it isconfidered, how far notwithftanding hehas outftrippedall that went before himin that ftudy, namely, of the Hebrewaccentuation; he underhood the Trench,and, for the fake of comparing tranha-tions, could read the Dutch Bible.There were few pieces of learning thathe had not fome good tafte of: But allhis knowledge behoved to be otherwaysdifcovered than by his profefTmg of it:he. was a hard ftudent, of indefatigableapplication ; fo that, whatever he wasonce heartily engaged in, _ he knew notto quit, till, by help from heaveil, andinceffant labour, he got through it.Had a great knowledge and underftan-ding of human nature, of the mollproper methods of addrefling it, andthe moll likely handles for catchinghold of it.As a minifter he had on his fpirit adeep and high fenfe of divine things;was mighty in the fcriptures, in hisacquaintance with the letter, with thefpirit and fenfe of them, in happily ap¬plying and accommodating th$m forexplaining and illuftraring the ftibjecl.His knowledge and infight into the nyftery of Chriff was great, tho’ a hum-f.6 )bhng fenfe of his want was like tohave quite funk and laid him. by afterhe began to preach. He had a parti¬cular talent of going deep into the my-fteries of the gofpel, and at the fametime making them plain, making in¬telligible their connexion with and in¬fluence upon gofpei-holinefs : Notableinftances of which may be feen in hismod: valuable tratife of the Covenant,and in his fermons of Chrift in theform of a fervant. His intention wasrich, but judicioufly bounded; histhoughts were always juft, and oftennew; his expreflions proper and pure;his illuftrations and fimilies often fur-prifing j his method natural and clear;his delivery grave and graceful, withan air of earneftnefs, meeknefs, aflu-rance and authority tempered together.,No wonder his miniftration in holythings were all of them dear and preci¬ous to the faints. He was fixed andeftablifhed upon folid and rationalgrounds in the reformation principles,in oppofition to popery, prelacy, fuper-Jlition^and perfeeution. Was pleafantand lively in converfation, but alwayswith a decorum to his character: Quitefree of that fowrnefs of temper, or af-(7)cetical rigidy, that generally pofreliesmen of a retired life. He fed andwatched with diligence the flock overwhich the holy Ghoft made him over-feer; and, nothwithflanding his eagerpuirfuit pf that ftudy which was hisdelight, he abated nothing of his pre¬paration for the fabbath, nor of hiswork ?.broad in the parifh; nor did hefo much as ufe the Ihort hand, where¬of he was matter, but always wroteout his fermons fair, and generally asfull as he preached them: Far fromferving the Lord with that which cofthim nothing. It was his delight t6fpend and be fpent in the fervice of thegofpel. Was a faithful, and at thefame time a prudent reprover of fin.{Was endued with a rich meafure ofhriftian wifdom and prudence, with->ut craft or guile, whereby he was ex-eeding ferviceable in judicatories, andixcellently fitted for counfel in intri-ate cafes. Zeal and knowledge weren him united to a pitch rarely to beet with. Had a joint concern for pu-ity and peace in the church: No manore zealous for the former, and at theame time more ttudious of the latter,aving obferved and felt fo much of the( 8 >mifchief of divifion and reparation.Was exceeding cautious and fcrupulousof any thing new or unprecedented, un¬til he was throughly fatisfied of its ne-ceffity and grounds. It was his fettledmind, that folidly and ftrongly to e-ftablilh the truth was in many cafesthe befi:, the fhorteft, and the moft ef¬fectual way to confute error, withoutirritating and enflaming the paflions ofmen to their own and to the truth’s 'prejudice : Therefore, in his explicati¬on and vindication of the ProteftantDoctrine, in a paroxifm quarrelled andcondemned in a certain book, he an-fwered all and every body, but took no¬tice exprefly of no body. He obeyedthe voice, (i Tim. vi. 11.) But thou,.O man of God, flee thefe things, being ,in an uncommon degree dead to the*world : Finding fays he, in the account3of his life, the bufinefs of it enfnaringto my mind, 1 had neither heart nor lhand for it—On all which, accounts;.he was much refpected and regarded iby, not only his brethren that differed ifrom him, but generally by all forts ofj imen. To conclude, he was a fcribc-1Angularly inftructed unto the kingdom >—happy in finding out acceptable( 9 )words—A workman that needeth notjibe afhamed, rightly dividing the wordI of truth. A burning and a fhining'light The righteous lhall be had in1 everlafting remembrance.Thus far, we have attempted to drawa character of this great man ; and {halli only conclude in his own words, fromthe general account of his life, by him-Telf, addreffed to his children, in theIclofsofit, as follows:| “ Thus alfo I was much addicted topeace, and averfe from controverfy ;jr tho’ once engaged therein, I was letiP to go through with it. I had noIH great difficulty to retain a due ho-|‘ nour and charity for my brethrenIr* differing from me in opinion andc practice: But then 1 wras in no great4 hazard neither of being fwayed by‘ them, to depart from wha; dged‘ truth or duty. Withal, it was eafy‘to me to yield to them in things‘ wherein I found not myfelf in con-‘ fcience bound up. Whatever pre-I ‘ cipitant Heps I have made in the' ‘ courfe of my life, which I defire to‘ be humbled for, ralhnefs in condudl* was not my weak fide. But, fince‘ the Lord, by his grace, brought me( 10 )(t to confider things, it was much my“ exercife to difcern fin and duty in“ particular cafes ; being afraid to ven-“ ture on things, until I fliould fee“ myfelf called thereto ; But, when the“ matter was cleared to me, I general-“ ly ftuck faft by it, being as much“ afiwid to defert the way which I took .“ to be pointed out to me. I never“ had the art of making rich, nor“ could I ever heartily apply myfelf to“ the managing of fecular affairs.'“ Even the fecular way of managing !“ the difcipline of the church was fo“ unacceptable to me, that I had no“ heart to dip in the publick church“ management. What appearances I“ made at any time in thefe matters“ were not readily in that way.” Heconcludes.“ And thus have. I given fome ac~.“ count of the days of my vanity.“ Upon the’whole, I blefs my God ini,“ Jefus Chrift, that, ever he made me“ #a Ghriflian, and took an early deal- j“ ling with my foul; that ever he made“ me a mini her of th,e gpfpel, and gave“ me fome infight into the dodlrine of“ his grace; and that ever he gave me „“ the bled: Bible, and brought me ac~( 11 ) . .quainted with the originals, and ef-pecially with the Hebrew text. Theworld hath all along been a ftep-dame to me, and wherefoever 1 wouldhave attemtped to neftle in it, therewas a thorn of uneafinefs laid forme. Man is born crying, lives com¬plaining, and dies difappointed fromthat quarter. All is vanity and vex¬ation of fpirit.

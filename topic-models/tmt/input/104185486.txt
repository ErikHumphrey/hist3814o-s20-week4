Anderson and Gardeners',East Dean Street.’Midst Winter’s gloom, the wondering eye perceivesSpring’s roses, trees of Summer, Autumn’s leaves,Emblematizing well the changing year;The scattered snow-drops, too, of Winter's reign,And bright armorial bearings entertainThe Fancy, on the webs as they appear.Sage Anderson, when William, Britain’s King,Whose Fame for future ages is on wing,Such hopes Britannia places now on him,When he comes down to Scotland, will you notWeave for the King some curious vest or coat,To emulate the shirt without a seam? *Ingenious Gardeners! ye may doubly claimTiie rosy honours of the Gardener’s name,While on your webs appear such fruits and flower?,W hich well may last for generations; whileAround their clusters mimic children smileBy Ingenuity’s creative powers.* The Shirt without a seam was manufactured by Mr.Anderson’s brother, Mr. David Anderson, and was presentedto King George the IV., for which Mr. A. was rewardedwith fifty guineas. Messrs. It. and J. Gardener werethen at their apprenticeships with Mr. A., and witness¬ed the progress of this complicated production of inventive in¬genuity,—being occasionally employed in getting forward theroyal web, which contained another Shirt, now placed in theHunterian Museum, University of Glasgow.

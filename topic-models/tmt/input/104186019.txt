Aha, Johnny, monv a ane has been0beguiled wic ancc; and do it ance, ye may do itaye. What an ye get a bystart, and hae to suf¬fer for the foul act of fornication.Jock.

Ay, but my mither is aye angry at onybody that evens themselves to me, an it binnathem she likes, indeed she bade me tak ony body,if it wasna auld tottering Tammy; for his beardis aye brown wi’ sucking tobacco, and slavers a’the breast of his fecket.Jock. O Maggy take me, and I’ll tell youwhat I hae. First my father left me, when hedied fifty merks, twa sacks, twa pair of sunks;the hens and the gaun gear was to be dividedbetween me and my mither, and if she died first,a’ her gear was to come in among mine, and if Idied before her, a’ my gear was to come back toher again, and her to marry anither man, if shecould get him. But since 'tis happened sac, sheis to gie me Brucky and the black mare, the halfof the cogs, three spoons, four pair of blankets,and a eannas: she’s to big a twabey to her aingavel, to be a dwelling house to me and my wife,and I’m to get the wee byre at the end of theraw, to hand my cow and twa couties; the halfof the barn, and a bed of the kail-yard, as langas she leaves, and when she dies, I’m to pay forthe yerding of her honestly, and a’ the o’ercomeis to be my ain ; and by that time I’ll be as richas e’er my father was before me.8Wag. Truly, Johnnie; I’se no sae meikle tothe contiair, but an ye hae a mind to tak1 me wi’what I hae, tell me either now or never, for I’sebe married or lang be.Jock.

That’s right, I want nae mair, ’tis anunco thing to marry a naked woman, ana gethae thing but twa bare legs.Mag. O Johnny, ye’re in the right oh, formony a ane is beguiled and gets naething, butmy father is to gie me forty pound Scots thatnight I am married, a lade of meal, a furlot ofgroats: auld Ciummie is mine since she was acalf, and now she has a stirk will tak the bill ereBelten yet ;I hae twa sfane of glide lint, and threepockfu’s of tow, agude ca’f bed, t wa bousters andthree cods, with twa pair of blankets, and a cor-1ei ing, forby twa pair to spin, but my mither wad-na gie me creesh to them, and ye ken the butteris dear now.

Thou’s want for naething, my bairn,to get thee ready for marriage.The wooing being over and the day beingset, Jockey’s mither killed the black boul hornedyeal ewe, that lost her lamb the last year, threehens and a gule-fitted cock ; to prevent the rip¬ples, 5 pecks of maut masked in the muckle kirn,a pint of treacle, to mak it thicker, and sweeter,and mamier for the mouth ; 5 pints of whisky,wherein was garlic and spice, for raising theilwind, and the elearin v their water. The friendsand good neighbours went wi’ John to the Kirk,where Maggy chanced to meet him, and was; married by the minister. The twa companies;j joined the gither, and came hame in a crowd;i and at every change-house they chanced to passi by, Providence stopt their proceeding with full| stoups, bottles, and glasses, drinking their healths,| wishing them joy, ten girls and a boy. Jockey! seeing so many wishing well to his health, couptup what he got for to augment his health, andgar him live long, which afterwards couped himup, and proved detrimental to the same.So hame they came to the dinner, where hisBlither presenting to them a piping het haggis,made of the creesh of the black boul horned ewe,boiled in the meikle pot, mixt with bear-meal,onions, spice, and mint. This haggis being suptwarm, the foaming swats and spice in the liquorset John’s belly a-bizzing like a working fat; andhe playing het-fit to the fiddler, was suddenlyseized with a bocking and rebounding, whichgave his dinner such a backward ca’, that he losta’ but the girt bits, which he scythed thro’ histeeth. His mither cried to spence him, and bedhim with the bride. His breeks being filed, theywashed both his hips and laid him in his bed.Pale and ghostly was his face, and closed were12baith his een. Ah! cries his mither, a'disiliftlday indeed; his bridal and his burial may be inae day. Some cuist water in his face, and jag Vihim wi a needle, till he began to rouse himselfup, and then lisp out some broken words.Mither, mither ! cries Jockey, whar am 1 now ?Whar are you now, my bairn, says his mither,ye’re bedet, and I’ll bring the bride to you.Beded, says Jockey, and is my bridal done else ?Ay is’t said his mither, and here’s the bride cometo lie down beside you, my man. Na na, mither,says Jockey, I’ll no lie wi an unco woman indeed,and it binna heads and thraws, the way that Ilie wi’ you, mither. O fy, John, says his mither,dinna affront yoursel’ and me baith, tak her ino’er the bed ay out ye, and kiss her, and clapher, and daut her till ye fa’ asleep. The bridefa’s a-crying out, O mither,! mither! was this theway my father guided you the first night ? Na,na, thy father was a man of manners, and bettermettle; poor thing, Meg, thou’s ca’d thy hogsto a bonny market. A bonny market! saysJockey’s mither; a shame fa’ you and her baith,he’s wordy of her though she were better norwhat sire is, or e’er will be.—His friends andher friends being a mixed multitude, some tookhis part, some took her’s, there did a battle be¬gin in the clap of a hand, being a* very fierce13tumult, which emlefl in blood; they struch sohard with stones, sticks, beetles, and barrowtrams; pigs, pots, stoups, and trenchers, wereflying like bombs and granadoes; the crook,bonis, and tangs, were all employed as weaponsot war, till down came the bed, with agreat inouof peats! So this distubed a’ the diversion atJockey’s bedding, and the sky was beginning tobreak in the east before the hurly-burly wasover.'isJiiffi auicvl /hi /, nr. PART IT.I Wdt /ijw hdt .-/nndt him ^Now, though all the ceremonies of Jot-key andMaggy’s wedding were ended, when they Werefairly bedded before a wheen rattling unrhly wit¬nesses, who dang down the bed aboon them ; thebattle still Increased, and John’s work turned outto be very wonderful, for he made Janet} thatwas his mithers servant lass the last year, grewlike an elshen haft and got his ain, Magp' \\Tbairn forby. rl he humsheughs were very great,until auld uncle Rabby came in to redd them ;and a sturdy auld fallow lie was: he stood livelywith a stiff- rumple, and by strength of his armsrave them aye sundry, flinging the taen east andthe tither wast, till they stood a’ round aboutlike as many for-foughten cocks arid no tine durst3 cX \nv/ob si14steer anither for him. Jockey’s mither was caedo’er a kist and brokit a’ her hip on a round hec¬kle, up she gat, and running to foil Maggy’smither with the ladle, swearing she was the mitherof a’ the mischief that happened. Uncle Rabbyran in between them, he having a muckle nose,like a trumpet, she recklessly came o’er his lob¬ster neb a drive wi’ the laddie, till the blood came,ran down his old grey beard, and hang like snuflybubbles at it. O then he gaed wud, and lookedas waefu’ like as he had been a tod-lowrie comefrae worrying lambs, with his bloody mouth.With that he gets an auld flail and rives awa’ thesupple, then drives them a’ to the back of thedoor, but yet nane wan out; then wi chirtingand claping down comes the clay halien, andthe hen bawk wi Rab Reid the fiddler, who hadcrept up beside the hens, for the preservation ofhis fiddle.Ben comes the bride, when she got on her coat,clappet Rabby on the shouther, and bade himspare their lives, for there was blood enough shedin ae night, quoth she ; and that my beard canwitness quoth he. So they all came in obedienceto uncle Rabby, for his supple made their powsbaith saft and sair that night; but daft MaggySimpson sat by the fire and picked banes a’ thetime of the battle. Indeed, quoth she I think15/e’re a’ fools, but myself, for I came here to get;ji good supper, and ither folk hae gotten their skinveil paid.By this time up got Jock, the bridegroom,iliat was Jockey before he was married, but could-11a get his breeks ; yet wi a horse-nail he tackedns sark-tail between his legs, that nane mightee what every body should hide ; and rampling-y he cries, Settle ye, or I’ll gar my uncle settle'e, and saften your heads wi an auld supple.Poor llab Reid, the fiddler, took a sudden>last; same said he was maw-turned wi the fa’,for he bocked up a’ the barley, and then gar’dthe ale gae like a rainbow frae him, as brown aswort-brose.The hurley-burly being ended, and naethingbut fair words and shaking of bands, which wasa sure sign of an agreement, they began to cowtheir cutted lugs, and wash their sairs, a’ butJockey’s mither, who cried out. A black end toyou and your wedding baith, for I hae gotten ahunder holes dung in my arse wi' the round hec¬kle teeth.Jockey answers, A e'en baud you wi' them then,mither, ye will e'en be the better sail'd.Up gets auld Rabby, and auld Sandy, thesouter of Seggyhole, and put every thing in or¬der ; they prapet up the bed wi' a rake, and rip-pling kame ; the stoops being- broken, they wade« solid foundation of peats, laid on the caff bedand bowsters, and Jockey and Maggy were beddtthe second time.Jockey not being used to he wi‘ a naked wo¬man, except heads and thraws wi‘ his mith'er1,gets his twa hands abbot the bride's neck, andhis hough out-o'er lien hurdies, saying, I ne'erkist wife nor lass naked before, alid for fainuesfei ^1‘11 bite you, &e.Naething mair remarkable happened till abouthalf a year and four dikes thereafter, when in Icomes Marion Mushet, rinhing barefitfed arid'1 |barelegged. wi‘ bleart cheeks and a watery nose,cursing arid banning greeting and flyting.(Marion enters, crying,) And whar's John? !Mith.

I hadbetter married a tinkler, or followed the sodgers,as mony an honest man’s dochter has done, andlived a better life than I do.Up gets Jockey, and rins over the rigs for JohnRodger’s wife, auld Katty and howdy ; but or hewan back, she parted wi’ Patrick through perfectspite, and then lay twa-fauld o’er a stood in aswoon.Jock. A-weel, a-weel, sirs, though my first¬born is e’en dead without seeing the light of thewarld, ye’s a’ get bread and cheese to the blythe-meat, the thing; we should a warned on tlim' . ’1 ' If1hauket will sair the burial, and that will aye besome advantage ; and should Maggy die,, I rnayueen tak Jenny, the taen is as far a length as tlietither ; I’se be furnished wi’ a wife between the.twa.But Maggy grew better the next day, andwas able to muck the byre ; yet there gaed sic atittle-tattlin through the town, every auld wifetell a anither o’t, and a’ the light-hippet hissiesthat rins between towns.at e’en tugging at theirtow rocks, spread it round the kintry, and everybody’s mouth was filled wi’ Jockey and Jennyand how Maggy had parted with bairn.At last Mess John Hill hears of the foul fact,and sends the Elder of that quarter, and Clinkum-Bell, the grave-maker to summon Jockey andJenny, to the Session, and to see how the stoolof repentance wadset them. No sooner hadthey entered the door, but Maggy fa’s a greet¬ing and wringing her hands !

But I think there’s little ill thoughthey try it ance or twice or they be married ; ’tisan unco thing for a body to be bound to a busi¬ness or they ken whether they be able for it orno.Mag. Aye, aye, that’s your way of doingand his, but it‘s no the way ot ither honest fouk ;see what the Minister will say to it.Mith. ilie Minister is but a mortal man,22and there‘s defections in his members as well asin mine.Mag. Aye, but fouk should aye strive tomortify their members.Mith. Aye, aye mortify their members that'syour Whiggery, indeed ; But will you or onybody else, wi your mortifying of your membersprevent what's to come to pass ? I wish I sawthe Minister and his Elders, I'se gie them Scrip¬tures for a' his done yet. Tell nae me about themortifying of members, gin he has gotten a bys¬tart, let her and him feed it between them, andthey gie't soup about ; but she maun keep it thefirst quarter, and by that time muckle black Ladywill becauft; uTe sail sell the cauf and foster thewean on the cow's milk ; that's better mense fora faut, than a' your repen ting-stools; a wheenPapist rites, and rotten cerimonies, fashing fouks Iwi sack gowns and buttock-mails, and I dinnaken what. But bide ye till I see the Minister.Now Jockey and his mither wTent into the littlebyre and held a private meeting, mine presentbut auld Bruckie and the twa brutes, the bits ofcouties, that she might give him counsel how tobehave when he appeared before Mess John, toanswer for his bastard ; which coucludes the thirdand last part.23PART III.AfF he goes to the minister, and owns a’ his■ Taut to him; and Mess John desired him to ap¬pear before the congregation the next Sabbath,to be rebuked for his fau‘t.Jock. Indeed, Sir, I wad think naething tostan‘ a tims or twa on the black stool, to pleaseyou, if there were naebody in the kirk, on a ouke-day, but you and the elders to flyte a wee onme; but ‘tis waur on a Sunday to have a‘ bodieslooking and laughing at me, as I had been cod-iding the peas, sipping the kirn, or somethingjthat£s no bonny, like pissing the bed.Minist. Aweel John, never mind you thesethings, but come ye to the stool it‘s nothingwhen it‘s over, we cannot say o£er muckle to youabout it.Upon Sunday thereafter, John comes withUncle Rabby’s auld wide coat, a muckle greylang-tail’d wig, and a big bonnet, which coveredhis face, so that he seemed more like an old Pil¬grim than a young fornicator ! mounts the creepywi’ a stiff, stiff back, as he had been a man oisixty ! Every one booked at him, thinking hewas some old stranger, who knew not the stoolof repentance by another seat, so that he passedthe first dair unknown but to very few; yet? or24the second it came to be well known, that the]whole parish and many more, came to see him;which caused such a confusion, that he was ab¬solved, and got his children baptised the nextday.—But there happened a tullie between thetwa mothers’ who would have both their namesto be John. A-weel says auld John their fatherto the Minister, A-deed, Sir, ye maun ca’ the .tane John and the tither Jock, and that willplease baith these enemies of mankind.Minist. Now John, you must never kiss an¬other Woman but your own wife; live justly, likeanother honest man, and you’ll come to die well.Jock. A black end on a me, Sir, if ever I layan unlawfu’ leg upon a hissy again, an’ they sudlie down to me, as lang as our Maggy lasts; andfor dying, there’s nae fear of that, or I’ll no get fairplay, if ye an’ a’ the aulder folk in the parish be inot dead before me. So I hae done wi’ ye now,fareweel Sir.

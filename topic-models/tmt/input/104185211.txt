THEMadrid Shaver’sSINGULAR ADVENTURES,ANDWonderful EscapeFROM THE SPANISHINQUISITION.A TRUE STORY.• JI THEMadrid Shaver.Nicolas Pedrosa, a busy little being, whowas shaver, surgeon and man-midwife, in the townof Madrid, mounted his mule and pushed throughthe gate of San Bernardino, being call’d to a pa¬tient in a neighbouring village upon a pressingoccasion. Every body knows, that the ladies inSpain, in certain cases, do not give long warningto practitioners of a certain description, andnobody knew it better than Nicolas, who wasi resolved not to lose an inch of his way, norof his mule’s best speed by the way, if cudgellingcould beat it out of her. It was plain to Nicolas’sconviction, as plain could be, that his road laystraight forward to the little convent in front; themule was of opinion, that the turning on the lel>down the hill towards the Prade, was the road ofall roads most familiar and agreeable to herself,and accordingly began to dispute the point withNicolas, by fixing her forefeet resolutely in theground, dipping her head at the same time be¬tween them, and launching heels and cruppeyfuriously into the air, in the way of argument.Little Pedrosa, who was armed at heel with onemassy silver spur, of stout though ancient work¬manship, resolutely applied the rusty rowel to theshoulder of the beast, and at the same time, ad-, roitly tucking his blue cap under his right arm,; and flinging his skirt over his left shoulder encavalier, began to lay about him with a stout ash-4en sapling, upon the ears, pole, and cheeks, ofthe recreant mule. The fire now flashed from apair of Andalusian eyes, as black as charcoal, andnot less inflammable, and taking the cigar fromhis mouth, with which he had vainly hoped tohave regaled his nostrils in a sharp winter’s even¬ing by the way, raised such a thundering troop•of angels, saints, and martyrs, from Saint Mic¬hael, downwards, not forgetting his own name¬sake St. Nicolas de Tolentino, by the way, thatif curses could have made the mule to go, the dis¬pute would have been soon ended : but not a saintcould make her stir any other way than upwardsand downwards at a stand. A small troop ofmendicant friars were at this moment conductingthe host to a dying man—‘ Nicolas Pedrosa,’said an old friar, ‘ be patient with your beast, andspare your blasphemies; remember Balaam.’—‘ Ah! father,’ replied Pedrosa, ‘ Balaam cudgelledhis beast till she spoke, so will I mine till sheroars.’—‘ Fie, fie, prophane fellow,’ cries anoth¬er of the fraternity. ‘ Go about your work, friend,’quoth Nicolas, ‘ and let me go about mine; Iwarrant it is the more pressing of the two; yourpatient is going out of the world, and mine iscoming into it.’ ‘ Hear him,’ cries a third, ‘ hearthe vile wretch how he blasphemes the body ofGod.’ And then the troop passed slowly on tothe tinkling of the bell.A man must know nothing of a mule’s ears,who does not know what a passion they have forthe tinkling of a bell; and no sooner had the jung-ling chords vibrated in the sympathetic organsof Pedrosa’s beast, than bolting forward with a* *5sudden spring, she ran roaring into the throngof friars, trampling on some, and shouldering oth¬ers, at a prophane rate; when Nicolas availing*himself of the impetus, and perhaps not able tocontrol it, broke away, and was out of sight'moment. ‘AH the devils in hell blow fire yiW>^thy tail, thou beast of Babylon, muttered Nicol¬as to himself, as he scampered along, never oncelooking behind him, or stopping to apologize#for ’the mischief he had done to the bare feet and*,shirtless ribs of the holy brotherhood.Whether Nicolas saved his distance, as like¬wise if he did, whether it was a male or a femaleCostilian he usherd into the world, we shall not.just now enquire, contented to await his returnin the first of the morning, next day, when hehad no sooner dismounted at his shop, and deliv¬ered his mule to a sturdy Arragonese wench, thanDon sgnaciade Santor Aparicio, Alguazil-mayorof the supreme and general Inquisition, put anorder into his hand, signed and sealed by the In¬quisitor-general, for a conveyance of his body tothe Casa, whose formidable door presents itself inthe street adjoining to the square in which Ni¬colas’s brazen basin hung from, the emblem of histrade.The poor little fellow, trembling in every joint,and with a face as yellow as saffron, droptakneeto the alter which fronts the entrance, and cros¬sed himself most devotely : as soon as he had as¬cended the first flight of stairs, a porter habitedin black opened, the tremendous barricade, andNicolas, with horror, heard the grating of theheavy bolts that shut him in. He was ledG .through passages and vaults, and melancholy cells,till he was delivered into the dungeon, where hewas finally left to his solitary meditations. Hap¬less being; what a scene of horror! Nicolas feltall the terrors of his condition, but being an An¬dalusian, and, like his countrymen, of a livelyimagination, he began to turn over all the resour¬ces of his invention for happy fetch, if any suchmight occur, for helping him out of the dismallimbo he was in : he had not long to seek for thecause of his misfortune; his adventure with thebarefooted friars was a ready solution of all diffi¬culties of that nature, had there been any ; therewas, however, another thing, which might havetroubled a stouter heart than Nicolas’s—lie was.a Jew. this, of a certain, would have been astaggering item in a poor devil s confession, butthen it was a secret to all the world but Nicolas,and Nicolas’s conscience did not then urge himto reveal it. He now began to overhaul the in¬ventory of his personals about him, and with somesatisfaction counted three little medals of theblessed Virgin, two Agnus Deis, a Saint Nicol¬as de Tolentino, and a formidable string of beads,all pendant from his neck, and within his shirt;in Ids pockets he had a paper of dried figs, a smallbundle of cigars, a case of lancets, squirt and for¬ceps, and two old razors in a leathern, envelope ;these he had deliverer! one by one to the algunzil,who first arrested him,—1 and let them make themost of them,’ said he to. himself, ‘ they can nev¬er prove an Israelite by a case of razors.’ U pona closer rummage, however, he discovered in asecret pocket, a letter, which the Alguazii had/overlooked, and which his patient Donna Leon¬ora de Casafonda had given him in charge to de¬liver as directed. £ Well, well/ cried he, ‘ let itpass; there can be no mystery in this harmlessscrawl; a letter of advice to some friend or rela¬tion ; I’ll not break the seal; let the fathers readit, if they like, ’twill prove the truth of my de¬position, and help out my excuse for the hurryof my errand, and the unfortunate adventure ofa damned refractory mule.’—And now no soonerhad the recollections of the wayward mule cros¬sed the brain of poor Nicolas Pedrosa, than hebegan to blast her at a furious rate. ‘ The scrat¬ches and the scab to boot confound thy scurvyhide,’ quoth he ‘ thou ass-begotten bastard,whom Noah never let into his ark! The ven¬geance take thee, for an uncreated barren beastof promiscuous generation ! What devil’s crot¬chet got into thy capricous noddle, that thoushouldst fall in love with that Nazaritish bell, andrun bellowing like Lucifer into the midst of thosebarefooted vermine, who were more malicious andmore greedy than the locusts of Egypt ? Oh !that I had the art of Simon Magus to conjurethee into this dungeon in my stead; but I war¬rant thou art chewing thy barley straw withoutany pity for thy wretched master, whom thy jade’stricks have delivered bodily to the tormentors, tobe sport for these uncircumcised sons of Dagon’And now the cell door opened, when a savagefigure entered, carrying a huge parcel of clank¬ing fetters, with a collar of iron, which he putround the neck of poor Pedrosa, telling him,with a truly diabolical grin, whilst he was8rlvetting it on, s that it was a proper cravat forthe throat of a blasphemer.’—‘ Jesus Maria!quoth Pedrosa, ‘ is-all this fallen upon me, foronly cudgelling a restive mule?' ‘ Aye,’ criedthe demon, ‘ and this is only a taste of what isto come,’ at the same time slipping the pincersfrom the screw he was forcing to the head, hecaught a piece of flesh in the forceps, and wrench¬ed it out of his cheek, laughing at poor Nicolas,whilst he roared out with the pain, telling him‘ it was a just reward for the torture he had puthim to a while ago, when he tugged out a toothtill he broke it in his jaw.’ ‘ Ah, for the love ofheaven,’ cried Pedrosa, ‘ have more pity on me;for the sake of Saint Nicolas de Tolentino, myholy patron, be not so unmerciful to a poor bar¬ber-surgeon ; and I will shave your worship’sbeard for nothing as long as I have life.’ Oneof the messengers of the auditory now came in,and bade the fellow strike oft’ the prisoner’s fet¬ters, for that the holy fathers were in council, anddemanded him for examination. ‘ This is some¬thing extraordinary,’ quoth the tormentor, ‘ Ishould not have expected it this twelvemonth tocome.’ Pedrosa’s fetters were struck off; somebrandy was applied to staunch the bleeding ofhis cheek; his hands and face were washed, anda short jacket of coarse ticking thrown over him ;and the messenger, with an assistant, taking himeach under an arm, led him into a spacious cham¬ber, where at the head of a long table sat his ex¬cellency the Inquisidor-general, with six of hisaccessors, three on each side of the chair of state:the Alguazil-mayor, a secretary, and two notaries,Jr9i with other officers of the holy council, were at¬tending in their places.The prisoner was placed behind a bar at the1 foot of the table, between the messengers whoi brought him in; and having made his obesianceto the awful presence, in the most supplicatingil manner, he was called upon, according to the: usual form of question, by one of the junior judges,i to declare his name, parentage, profession, age,f place of abode, and to answer various interroga-i lories, of the like trifling nature : his ExcellencyI the Inquisidor-general now opened his reverendUi lips, and in a solemn tone of voice, that penetrat*!! ed to the heart of the poor trembling prisoner,interrrogated him as follows :—Nicolas Pedrosa, we have listened to the ac-|| count you give of yourself, your business and con-inections; now tell us for what offence or offences,| you are standing a prisoner before us; examinei your heart, and speak the truth from your con-S science without prevarication or disguise.May it please your excellency, replied Pedrosarith all due submission to your holiness and thiseverend assembly, my most equitable judges, Ionceive I stand here before you for no worse arime than that of cudgeling a refractory mule annimal so restive in its nature, (under correctionf your holiness be it spoken,) that although Irere blessed with the forbearance of holy Job,!Tor like him too I am married and my patiencerath been exercised by a wife,) yet could I notforbear to smite my beast for her obstinacy, and; die rather, because I was summoned in the wayt )f my profession, as I have already made knownft .10to your most merciful ears, upon a certain cryingoccasion, which would not admit of a moment’sdelay.Recollect yourself, Nicolas, said his Excellen¬cy, the Inquisidor general; was there nothingelse you did, save smiting your beast ?I take Nicholas de Tolentino to witness, re¬plied he, that I know of no other crime, for whichI can be responsible at this righteous tribunal,save smiting my unruly beast. Take notice,brethren, exclaimed the Inquisidor, this unholywretch holds trampling over friars to be no crime.Pardon me, holy father, replied Nicholas Ihold it for the worst of crimes, and therefore sur¬render my refractory mule to be dealt with as yousee fit: and if you impale her alive it will be nomore than she deserves.Your wits are too nimble, replied the judge;have a care they do not run away with your dis¬cretion ; recollect the blasphemies you uttered inthe hearing of those pious people.I humbly pray your Excellency, answered theprisoner, to recollect that anger is a short mad¬ness, and I hope allowances will be made byyour holy council for words spoke in haste to arebellious mule : the prophet Balaam was thrownoff his guard by a simple ass, and what is an asscompared to a mule? If your Excellency hadseen the lovely creature that was screaming inagony till I came to her relief, and how fine aboy I ushered into the world, which would havebeen lost but for my assistance, I am sure I shouldnot be condemned for a few hasty words spokenin passion.11Sirrah! cried one of the puisne judges, respectthe decency of the court. Produce the contentsof the fellow’s pockets before the court, said thepresident; lay them on the table.Monster! resumed the aforesaid puisne judge,! taking up the forceps, what is the use of thisi diabolical machine ? Please your reverence, re-| plied Pedrosa, ‘ aptum est ad extrahendos foetus.’—Unnatural wretch, again exclaimed the judge,u have murdered the mother.The mother of God forbid ! exclaimed Pedro-11 acquit me of that charge, and so saying heidered the letter we have before made mentionThe secretary took it, and by command ofi court read as follows:—“ Senior Don Manuel de Herrerra,“ When this letter, which I send by Nicolasdrosa, shall reach your hands, you will know *it I am safely delivered of a lovely boy, afterlangerous labour, in consideration of which Ily you to pay to the said Nicholas Pedrosa; sum of twenty gold pistoles, which sum his:eelleacy— Hold, cried the Inquisitor-generalrtuag liastily from Ids seat, and snatching away; letter, tlrere is more in this than meets thee; break up the court; I must take an exam-ition of this prisoner in private.As soon .as the room was cleared, the Inquisi--general, beckoning to the prisoner to follown and retired into a private closet where throw-r himself carelessly into an arm chair, he turn-a gracious countenance upon the poor affright-accoucheur, and bidding him sit down uponI believe I have a proof in my pocket thatna low stool by his side, thus accosted him:—Take heart, Senior Pedrosa, your imprisonmentis not likely to be very tedious, for I have a com¬mission you must execute without loss of time ;you have too much consideration for yourself, tobetray a trust, the violation of which must involveyou in inevitable ruin, and can in no degree at¬taint my character, which is far enough beyondthe reach of malice; be attentive, therefore, to myorders; execute them punctually and keep mysecret as you tender your own life : dost thouknow the name and condition of the lady whomthou hast delivered? Nicholas assured him hedid not and his Excellency proceeeded as follows :Then I tell thee, Nicholas, it is the illustriousDonna Leonora de Casafonda; her husband is thepresident of Quito, and daily expected with thenext arrivals from the South Seas: now, thoughmeasures have been taken for detaining him atthe port, where he shall land, till he shall receivefurther orders, yet you must be sensible DonnaLeonora’s situation is somewhat delicate; it willbe your business to take the speediest measuresfor her recovery ; but as it seems she has had adangerous and painful labour, this may be a workof more time than corld be wished, unless somemedicines more efficacious, than common are ad¬ministered ; art thou acquainted with any such,friend Nicolas, my posesses have been tolerablysuccessful; I have bandages and cataplasms, withoils and conserves, that I have no cause tocom-olain of; they will restore nature to, its properstate in all decent time Thou talkest like a fool,friend Nicolas, interrupting him, said the Inquis-13itor? What tellest thou me of thy swatbingsand swaddlings? quick work must be wroughtby quick medicine : hast thou none such in thybotica ? I’ll answer for it thou hast not; there¬fore, look you, sirrah, here is a little vial com¬pounded by a famous chemist; see that you mixit in the next apocem you administer to DonnaLeonora; it is the most capital sedative in nat¬ure ; give her the whole of it and let her husbandreturn when he will, depend upon it he will makeI no discoveries from her.— Humph! quoth Nico-]| las within himself, well said Inquisidor ! He(I took the vial with all possible respect, and was:« not wanting in professions of the most inviolableI fidelity and secrecy No more words friend Nic-1 olas, quoth the Inquisidor, upon that score ; I do| not believe thee one jot the more for all thy pro-i| mises, my dependence is upon thy fears and not[| thy faith ; I fancy thou hast seen enough of thisI place not to wish to return to it once for all.Ill Having so said, he rang a bell, and ordered Nic-5olas to be forthwith liberated, bidding the mes¬senger return his clothes instantly to him with'fall that belonged to him, and having slipt a purseininto his hand well filled with doubloons, he badei him begone about his business, and not see hisface again till he had executed his demands.Nicolas bolted out of the porch without takingi; leave of the altar, and never checked his speed1:till he found himself fairly housed under shelterof his own beloved brass bason Aha! quothNicolas, my lord Inquisidor, I see the king is notikely to gain a subject more by your intrigues;i pretty, job you have set me about; and so.14when I have put th5 poor lady to rest with yourdamned sedative, my uongue must be stopt nextto prevent its blabbing; but I’ll shew you I wasnot born in Andalusia for nothing. Nicolas nowopened a secret drawer, and took out a few piecesof money, which, in fact, was his whole stock ofcash in the world; he loaded and primed his pis¬tols, and carefully lodged them in the holsters ofhis saddle ! he buckled to his side his trusty spade,and hastened to caparison his mule. Ah, thouimp of the old one, quoth he/as he entered thestable, art not ashamed to look me in the face ?But come, hussy, thou owest me a good turn,methinks; stand by me this once, and be friendsfor ever! thou art in good case, and if thou wiltput thy best foot foremost, like a faithful beast,thou shalt not wmnt for barley on the way. Thebargain was soon struck between Nicolas andhis mule, he mounted her in the happy moment,and pointing his course toward the bridge ofToledo, which proudly strides with half a dozenlofty arches over a stream scarce three feet wide,he found himself as completely in a desart in halfa mile’s riding, as if he had been dropt in thecentre of Arabia Petraea. As Nicolas’s journeywas not a tour of curiosity, he did not amusehimself with a peep at Toledo, or Talavera, oreven Merida by the way ; for the same reason hetook a circumbendibus round the frontier townof Badajoz ; and crossing a little brook, refreshedhis mule with the last draught of Spanish water,and instantly congratulated himselt upon enter¬ing the territory of Portugal. Bravo! quothhe, patting the neck of his mule, thou shalt15have a supper this night of the best sive-meatthat Estramadura can furnish; we are now in acountry where the scattered flock of Israel foldthick and fare well. He now began to chauntthe Song of Solomon, and gently ambled on inthe joy of his heart.When Nicolas at length reached the city ofLisbon, he hugged himself in his good fortune;f still he recollected that the Inquisition had long; arms, and he was yet in a place of no perfect se-I curity. Our adventurer had in early life actedjl as assistant-surgeon in a Spanish frigate bound;jj! to Buenos-Ayres, and been captured by a British| man-of-war, and carried into Jamaica, had very|[ quietly passed some years in that place as jour-| neyman apothecary, in which time he had ac-I quired a tolerable acquaintance with the English| languish. No sooner then did he discover theBritish ensign flying on the poop of an EnglishI frigate the lying in the Tagus, than he eagerlyil caught the opportunity of paying a visit to the18 surgeon ; and finding he was in want of a mate,:f offered himself, and was entered in that capacityfor a cruize against the French and Spaniards,'i with whom Great Britain was then at war. In; this secure asylum Nicolas enjoyed the first hap-i py moments he had experienced for a long time;< past, and being a lively good natured little fel-0 low, and one that touched the guitar and sung') sequidillas with a tolerable grace, he soon recom-1 mended himself to his ship-mates, and grew in1 favour with every body on board, ftom the cap¬tain to the cook’s mate.When they were out upon their cruize, hover-16ing on the Spanish coast, it occurred to Nicolas,that the Inquisitor-general at Madrid had toldhim of the expected arrival of the president ofQuito, and having imparted this to one of thelieutenants, he reported it to the captain ; and asthe intelligence seemed of importance, he availedhimself of it, by bawling into the track of thehomeward-bound galleons, and great was thejoy,when at the break of the morning the man at themast-head announced a square-rigged vessel inview. The ardour of a chace now set all handsat work; and a few hours brought them near en¬ough to discern that she was a Spanish frigate,and seemingly from a long voyage : little Pedrosa,as alert as the rest, stript himself for his work,and repaired to his post in the cockpit, whilst thethunder of the guns reeled incessantly over hishead ; three cheers from the whole crew at lengthannounced the moment of victory, and a fewmore minutes ascertained the good news, that theprize was a frigate richly laden from the SouthSeas, with the governor of Quito and his suiteon board.Pedrosa was now called upon deck, and senton board the prize as interpreter to the first lieu¬tenant, who was to take posession, of her.— Hefound everv thinsj in confusion, a deck coveredwith the slain, and the whole crew in consterna¬tion at an event they were in no degree preparedfor, not having received any intimation of a war.He found the olficers in general, and the passen¬gers without exception, under the most horrid im¬pression of the English, expecting to be butcher¬ed without mercy. Don Manuel de Casafonda,17the governor, whose countenance bespoke a con-stituation far gone in a decline, had thrown him¬self on a sofa, in the last state of despair, andgiven way to an effusion of tears :'when the lieu¬tenant entered the cabin he rose trembling fromhis couch, and with the most supplicating action,presented to him his sword, and with it a casketwhich he caqvd in his other hand : as he tender¬ed these spoils to his conqueror, whether throughhis weakness, or of his own will, he made a mo¬tion of bending his knee: the generous Briion,shocked at the unmanly overture, caught himsuddenly with both hands, and turning to Ped¬rosa, said aloud,—Convince this gentleman heis fallen into the hands of an honourable enemy.Is it possible! cried Don Manuel, and lifting uphis streaming eyes to the countenance of the Brit¬ish officer, saw humanity, valour, and generouspity, so strongly characterized in his youthfulfeatures, that the conviction was irresistable. Willhe not accept my sword? cried the Spaniard.He desires you to wear it, till he has the honourof presenting you to his captain. Ah ! then hehas a captain, exclaimed Don Manuel, his sup-perior will be of another way of thinking ; tell himthis casket contains my jewels ; they are valuable;let him present them as a lawful prize, which willenrich the captor; his superior will not hesitateto take them from me.— If they are your excell¬ency’s private property, replied Predrosa, I amordered to assure you, that it your ship were lad¬en with jewels, no British officer in the serviceof his king will take them at your hands; the shipand effects of his Catholic Majesty are the only18piize of the captors; the personals of the passen¬gers are inviolate.—Generous nation ! exclaimedDon Manuel, how greatly have I wronged thee !The boats of the British frigate now came along¬side, and part of the crew were shifted out of theprize, an oilicer in the stern-sheets, and the crewin their white shirts and velvet caps, also came toescort the governor and the ship’s captain onboard the frigate, which lay with her sails to themast, awaiting their arrival: who were receivedon the gang-way by the second lieutenant, whilstperfect silence and the strictest discipline reignedin the ship, where all were under the decks, andno inquisitive eyes were suffered to wound thefeelings of the conquered. In the door of hiscabin stood the captain, who received them withcomplaisance, which does not revolt the unfort¬unate by an overstrained politeness : which couldnot fail to impress the prisoners with the mostfavourable ideas; and as Don Manuel spokeFrench, he could converse with the British Cap¬tain without the help of an interpreter; as he ex¬pressed an impatient desire of being admitted tohis parole, that he might revisit his connections,from whom he had been long separated, he wasoverjoyed to hear that the English ship wouldcarry her prize into Lisbon ; and that he wouldthere be set on shore, and permitted to make thebest of his way from thence to Madrid. Hetalked of his wife with all the ardour of the mostimpassioned lover, and on whom he doated withthe fondest affection. The captain indulged himin these conversatians, and being a husband him¬self, knew how to allow for all the tenderness of19his sensations. Ah, Sir, cried Don Manuel, turn-ino- to Pedrosa, who at that moment entered thecabin, this gentleman, whom I take to be aSpaniard, may have heard the name of DonnaLeonoro de Casafonda; if he has been at Madrid,it is possible lie may have seen her; should thatbe the case, he can testify to her external charms;I alone can witness the perfections of her mind Senior Don Manuel, replied Pedrosa, I haveseen Donna Leonora, and your Excellency iswarranted in all you can say in her praise, thesewords threw the uxorious Spaniard into raptures;his eyes sparkled with delight; the blood rushedinto his emaciated cheeks, and every featureglowed with unutterable joy : he pressed Pedrosawith a variety of rapid enquiries, all which heevaded saying that he had ordy a casual glanceot her. The embarrassment, however, which ac¬companied these answers, did not escape theEnglish captain, who, shortly after, drawingPedrosa aside into the surgeon’s cabin, was byhim made acquainted with the melancholy situ¬ation of that unfortunate lady, nay, the very vialwas produced, with its contents, as put into thehands of Pedrosa by the Inquisitor.My heart bleeds said the British Captain, forthis unhappy husband; assuredly that monsterhas destroyed Leonora; as for thee, Pedrosa,whilst the British flag flies over your head, neith¬er Spain, nor Portugal, nor Inquisitors, nor de¬vils, shall annoy thee under its protection ; butit thou ever venturest over the side of this ship,and rashly settest thy foot upon Catholic soil,when we arrive at Lisbon, thou art a lost man 20I were worse than a madman, replied Nicolas,should I attempt it.—Keep close in this asylum :had it been our fate to have been captured bythe Spaniard, what would have become of thee.Nicolas replied I should have applied to the In¬quisitor’s vial; but a ship so commanded and somanned is in little danger of being carried into aSpanish port 1 hope not, said the captain, andI promise thee, thou shalt take thy chance in heras long as she is under my command; and if weconduct her to England, thou shalt have thy pro¬per share of prize-money, which, if the galleonbreaks up according to her entries, will be some- |thinuf towards enablino- thee to shift, and if thou |art as diligent in thy calling, as I am persuadedthou wilt be, whilst I live thou shalt never wanta seaman’s friend At these cheering words, 1little Nicolas threw himself at the feet of his gen- >erous preserver, and with streaming eyes, poured 'out his thanks from a heart animated with joy |and gratitude.—The captain raising him by the 1hand, forbade him as he prized his friendship, $ever to address him in that posture ary more; ■*thank me, if you will, added he, but thank me -as one man should another: let no knee bend inthis ship but in adoration of God—But now,continued he, let us turn our thoughts to the sit¬uation of our unhappy Casufonda: we are now ,drawing near Lisbon, where he will look to be |liberated on his parole. By no means let himventure into Spain, said Pedrosa; I am well as¬sured there are orders to arrest him in every port,or frontier town where he may present himself.I can well believe it, replied the captain; his21piteous case will require further deliberation; inthe mean time, let nothing transpire on yourpart; and keep yourself out of his sight as care¬fully as you can.—This said, the captain left thecabin, and both parties repaired to their severaloccupations.As soon as the frigate and her prize cast an¬chor in the Tagus, Don Manuel de Casafondaimpatiently reminded our captain of his promisedparole. The painful moment was now come,when an explanation of some sort became una¬voidable: the generous Englishman, with a coun¬tenance expressive of the tenderest pity, took theSpaniard’s hand in his, and seating him on acouch beside him, ordered the centinel to keepthe cabin private, and delivered himself as fol¬lows :—Senior Don Manuel, I must now impart to youthat you have enemies in your own country, whowill arrest you on your landing; but reposesuch trust in my houour, and do not demand afurther explanation.—Heaven and earth ! criedthe astonished Spaniard, who can be those ene¬mies, and what have I done to deserve them ! Sofar I will open myself answered the captain, asto point out the Inquisitor-general. The bestfriend I have in Spain, exclaimed the Governor,my sworn protector he my enemy ! impossible.Well sir, replied the captain, I must exert myauthority for your sake, to make this ship yourprison, till I have waited on our minister at Lis-b bon, and enquire for your safety ; but suspend thec harshness of this measure till I return ; and at|; the same time, he gave orders for the barge ; and22strict injunctions not to allow of the governer'squitting the frigate; he put off for the shore.Tiie emissaries of the Inquisition had tracedPedrosa, our captain had no sooner gone ashorethan i’e was accosted by a messenger of state, forthe surrender of Pedrosa; our worthy captain thensaid, that Spaniard is now born on my books, andbefore you shad take him out of the service of myking you must sn.’k his ship. He instantly pro¬ceeded to the house «?f the British Minister: herehe found Pedrosa’s intelligence, expressly ver¬ified.The captain lost no time in returning to hisfrigate, where he imparted to .Don Manuel theintelligence he obtained at the British Minister’s.The proposal was now suggested of sending let¬ters into Spain, and the governor retired to hisdesk and wrote them. In the afternoon the Min¬ister paid a visit to the captain, and received apacket from Don Manuel, and promised to for¬ward them by a safe conveyance.In due course this fatal letter from Leonoraopened all the horrible transactions to the wretch¬ed husband:—“ The guilty hand of an expiring wife, underthe agonizing operation of a mortal poison, tracesthese few trembling lines to an injured, wretchedhusband. If thou hast any pity for my partingspirit, fly the ruin that awaits thee, and avoidthis scene of villany and horror. I have bornea child to the monster, whose poison runs in myveins. The Inquisitor is my murderer—Mypen falls from my hand—Farewell for ever I”Had a shot passed through the heart of DonManuel, it could not more effectually have stoptits motions, he dropped lifeless on the couch, butby the care of the captain and Pedrosa. He soonrecovered Grief like his cannot be described bywords, ’twas suffocating woe.Drop the curtain over this melancholy pause,and attend the mournful widower, now landedupon English ground, and conveyed to theI house of a noble Earl, the father of our amiableIf captain. At the period of a few tranquillizingf weeks, here passed in the bosom of humanity, let-j ters came to hand from the British Minister atLisbon, in answer to a memorial, that I should| have stated to have been drawn up by the friend-' ly captain before his departure from that port.‘ By these letters it appeared, that the criminalwas either no longer in existence, or in a situationever to be heard of any more, till roused by theawakening trump, he should be summoned tolastremendous last account. As for the unhappywidower, it was fully signified to him, fromauthority, that his return to Spain, whether up¬on exchange or parole, would be no longer op¬posed ; nor had he any thing to apprehend onthe part of government, when he should arrivethere. The same was signified in fewer wordsUto the exculpated Pedrosa,Whether Don Manuel de Casafonda will at aliiluture period, avail himself of the overtures, timenjalone can prove: as for little Nicolas, whoseIprize money has set him up in a comfortable littlelishop in Duke’s place, where he breathes theijveins and cleanses the bowels of his Israelitishbrethren, in a land of fredom and toleration. His24merry heart is at rest, save only when, with firein his eyes, and vengeance on his tongue, heanathematizes the Inquisition : and struts in thesynagogue every Sabbath, with as bold a stepand as erect a look, as if he was himself HighPriest of the Temple, going to perform sacrificesupon the re-assembling of the scattered tribes.

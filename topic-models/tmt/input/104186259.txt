Stole Nancy’s picture* and the charm.i.That she had brac’d upon his arm :!Then, as she seem’d to breath her last,i A frightful monster held her fast,| Threat’ning he should from Nancy part,1 No more to press her to his heart:j Jack gave in agony a scream,! Then smil’d to find ’twas but a dream.n,k ■ * •! Next morn a vessel hove in sight j. An enemy ! hot grew the fight;! She struck ; a brig of largest size;. And Jack made England with the prize :Reach’d home, where Nancy long had wept,I And sore fatigu’d turn’d in and slept;But truth assuming fancy’s part,He held his Nancy to his heart;Nor, as at sea, did these things seem.He woke, and found ’twas not a dream.DUNCAN GRAY.Duncan Gray cam here to woo,Ha, ha, the wooing o’t ;4 _■On new-year’s-day, \Vffen we were fou,Ha, hi, the wooing o’t.Maggie coost her head fu’ heigh,I.ook’d askfent and uhcb sfeeigh, ,Gart poor !Dunca‘n ^tahd abeigh,Ha, ha, the wooing o’t.Duncan fleech’d, and Duncan pray’d,Ha, ha, the wooing o’t jMeg was deaf as Ailsa Craig,Ha, ha, the wooing o’t.Duncan sigh’d baith out an’ in,Grat his een baith blear’t an’ biin’,Spak o’ louping o’er a lin,Ha, ha, the wooing o’t.rime an’ chance are but a tide,Ha, ha, the wooing o’t.Slighted love is sair to bide,Ha, ha, the wooing o’t.Shall I like a fool quoth he,For a haughty hissy die ?She may gae to France for me!Ha, ha, the wooing o’t.How it comes, let dortons tell,H :, ha, the wooing o’t j5Meg grew sick, as lie grew well,Ha, ha, the wooing o't;Something in her bosom wrings,For relief, a sigh she brings,An’ oh !

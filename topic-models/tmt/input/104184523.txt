Edinburgh, on the24th of June, 1821, his father was agame keepenbut afterwards a dog-train¬er. He was early put to school, whenhe acquired a good knowledge of Eng¬lish Grammar, Writing and Arithmetic.About the age of ten, a trifling acci¬dent occurred at home which for fearof punishment from his father, deter¬mined him to leave home, and fromthat moment he dated the commence¬ment of his sinful career. He had madeno wicked acquaintance as yet, but cmo.4mitted several depredations by himself.The firs.t of these was stealing a Ban¬tam Cock from a woman at the back ofthe New Town, Edinburgh. Havingtaken a fancy to it, he offlred to buy it,but the woman wouLi not sell it; hefell on the schemefrof putting anothercock of his own a-fighting, and thencame off with his prize. His next waslifting a shop till from a poor woman inStock.Bridge. Being some miles fromtown and tired, he mounted a pennywhich was grazing on the road side, androde home, where he kept it for sometime* in an out-house, where he had for-,mt rlv kept a Cuddle j he kept it therefor several days, until the owner foundit out by accident. At Leith races in1813, he enlisted in the Norfolk Mil¬itia, and learned the drum and Bugle-horn ; the Regiment was disbanded inabout a year afterwards, and he was dis- 'charged. His father was then livingin the south back of the Cannongate,Edinburgh, and he went home, whenhe was put as an apprentice to the Mill¬wright and engineering business, withCockbura and Baird, in the Canongate,*'5where he behaved with honesty, andwas very well liked by his employers.His master having given up businesshe was of course thrown idle and at thistime got acquainted with many worth¬less characters, among whom was oneBarney, an Irishman, he had been breda taylor in Dumfries, he was older thanHaggart, of great bodily strength, anda most skillful pickpocket.—Barney puthim up to a number of tricks, and theyagreed to travel together. In Ai.gust1817. just when on the point of goingto England, they past a day at Porto-bello Races, and picked a Gentleman'spocket of a£ll. the first ever Haggartattempted in day-light j with this tookout-aide places on the Jedburgh Coachand got themselves genteely dressed.They attended St James* fair at Kelso,and picked £°Z0 from two persons ;from thence they went to Dumfries,and stopt three weeks, they attendedLockerby fair, and going into a publichouse, a farmer and drover were cast¬ing out, when Barney blew the coal,and they fell a fighting, and both tum¬bled ; Barney picked the farmer's pock-6et of £%3. Kaggart called for thewaiter, and appeared in «» violent pas¬sion, paid for a bottle of porter, abusedhim for putting them into such com*pany, and immediately left the house.They departed next morning, and wentto Langholm fair, w here they took froma sheep fanner, *£100, in ten poundnotes, and £10, in 20 shilling, notes—About half an hour after, they saw JohnRichardson a Dumfries Officer runningabout, but he did not notice them.The> took a post-chaise, and went toAnnan, and next day took the Goachfor Carlisle.On other nights they got 2 gold wat-clv: ; they took about £70. in wholedin i. ♦heir stay in Newcastle. Theythen went to Durham and at nightbroke a lonely house on the road toYork j they got *£20, here ; the) wereapprehended for this act, tried, andfound Guilty, and pdt back to prisonto be brought up for sentence of deathat the end of the assizes.—They brokethe prison that night, but Haggart onlyescaped t he provided himself with arope-ladder, and gave the saw to Bar-1fie^ who made his escape that samenignt. When Haggart was coming toDurham from Yo»*k with the saw, incompany with a York pick-pocket, theywere pursued by two constables; andjust as one was apprehending Haggart,.he laid him low with his pistol.—Theygot clear away, and he never knew whe¬ther the man was murdered or not, buthe thought so.—They next went toColdstream fair, and Barney beingtoundattempting a farmer’s pocket, got threemonths in Jedburgh jail. Haggartwent to Newcastle again, and to thesame lodgings, where he was treatedlike a son ; little did the people knowwho they were so kind t<£—He did nu¬merous tricks here, and then proceededto Edinburgh, where he carried on th£same line ; he did not live in his father'shouse.In September he started for Perthwith one Henry, and had some adven¬tures.—They returned to Leith, andweretakenby the Police for some crimesgot bail, and were liberated.Haggart had a number of adventuresin Edinburgh and neighbourhood, andswas put 4 months in Bridewell.—Afterbeing released, he met with some of hiscompanions, and took a trip throughthe North : he was in Aberdeen Jtiil forsome time, and after committing moredepredations, returned to Edinburgh.They broke into several houses inEdinburgh and Leith, and on NewYear’s morning 1820, Haggart had forhis share, 5 8ilver Watches and a Goldone, taken on the South and North brid¬ges.— He remained in Edinburgh tillthe iSth, when he was taken up and putinto the Lock-up house to find bail; hegot out, and one night paid a visit tothe Lock-up house, and gave the keep¬er so much drink, that he got the key,and liberated5 six prisoners.He went to Leith the night follow¬ing, and took lodgings in Cupar Street,and lived with a woman of the town ;while here, he eommitted various actsin Leith, Edinburgh, and neighbour,hood, by tying some shop doors, thrust¬ing his band through the windows andgrr.spiwhatever goods lay in his road,brea|ving ii o numerous houses, pickingpocket* of watches, &c.—In the course9«of these operations he removed to dif-i ferent lodgings. •On the 1st of March, while sitting inthis lodgings with a pick-pocket of thename of Forrest, in Johnston Street,'North Leith, Captain Ross of the Pol-! ice and one of his men came in upon;them ; Ross seized Forrest and cirriedhim off, leaving Haggart in charge ofthe Policeman ; when left alone, theJ Policeman opened a be i-room do«r andi was looking into it, when Hafggart fpr-j ced him in, locked the door, and was|i making his way down the stair when! he was met by Ross and another Pol-1 iceman ; a struggle commenced, butJ the three overpowered Haggart, andI he was carried to tne Police OfficeI streaming with blood. He was keptI here two days, and then put into the| jail to srand trial.—On the ^7th MarchI he got a small file, and cut the chains| off his legs, penetrated through twoij thick walls ith his handcuffV liberated, Forrest, and got to the outside about^ 5 o’clock next morning—When on the| outer stair, he saw a man cotnhur upQu^en Street, and he prepared to give10him battle ; but the man only said,*• Run, Haggait, run, I wont touchye ” Haggart took hold of Forrest’shand, and ran even on to Dalkeith,without stopping, stopped there allnight, and stole 12 yards blue cloth,started at two o’clock next morning forKelso, robbed a farmer of £4i. and setoff for Dumfries.—They were joinedby 2 other pick-pockets, one of whomwas hanged shortly after at Glasgow.In Dumfries he picked several pock¬ets, and entered different dwelling-houses, when he met in with his oldfriend, Barney M'Guire, never havingseen him since they parted at Kelso in1818. TheywereintendingtoleaveDum-fries that night, but Barney was taken up.Haggart started for Carlisle next mor¬ning, but was' overtaken and carriedbajek to Dumfries : Captain Ross arriv¬ed in a few days and carried him backto Leith jail.Barney was transported for fourteenyears, fiaggait was tried at Edinburghon the 12th of July, but got oft'; he w asthen sent to Dumfries, to stand trial atthe circuit’th^ret for house-breaking.His trial did not go on, and he wasi sent back to jail,—Here he got acquaintwith a lad, John Dunbar, who was un¬der sentence of transportation. He al¬so got acquaint with some people be¬longing to the town, who seemed wil¬ling to do him a favour, so Haggartmade the plans of fo t keys, and ^per¬son was to get them made for him,there being 4 doors betwixt his ceil and; the street. Having thus as be tho'iu'Utsecured his liberty, he vva» too easilyled into another scheme with Dunbar.Ha:'s> -ft thought hiipself certain of hisowrn liberty, but he thought it wouldi be a grand thing to clear the jail of allthe prisoners. Laurie, another prison¬er, proposed get*ing a stone, and tyingit in a napkin, and, some morning toknock down iimiter the head ja lor,and take the key$cFrom him. Haggartwas not fond of using the stone, a-, did not want to liurt the jailor; ad i lieproposed, when Thomas Morrin cauieup to the man under sentence.pf death,I to gag him into a closet at tue head pi the stair, and take the keys from iitr;Dunbar and some, ethers got the stdie<12and put it into a bag. On Tuesday the10th of October about twel ve o’clock,they noticed Hunter the head turnkeyleave the jail to attend the ilaces, andshortly after, Morrin came up with twoministers, whom he locked in the cellwith M'Grory, who was under sentenceof death.—Shortly after, Haggart plac¬ed himself in the closet at the head ofthe stai’rj where he had previously putthe stone and bag. tlunbar then cal¬led up Morrin to let out the ministers.He came up accordingly with a plate ofpotatoe-soup for M'Grory, and when hegot' to tiie top of the stair, Haggartcame out upon him from the closet, andthe pushing open of the door knockedthe plate out of his hand; he then struckhim one blow with tb^i stone, dashedhim down, and without the loss of a mo¬ment pulled the key of the outer doorfrom his pocket; He gave only one blowwith the stone1 ami threw it down. Dun¬bar picked it up, but no more blows'ere given) so that iiorrin must haveReived his other blows in felling.kf-Tgar1 'observed Dunbar on the topof km, rifling his breast for the key13which he ha?l got. Simpson had aholdot Morrin’s shoulders, and was beatinghis back upon the steps of the stair.Haggart rushed past them, crossed theyard as steadily as he could, pulled thekey from his pocket, anct opened theouter door.On getting out at the door he ranround the east corner of the jail wail,and then walked rapidly along the backstreet, and round a great part of thetown, till he came to the back of theKing’s Arms Inn. Dunbar made upto him, and that very moment they sawa policeman coming right up to meet| them ; on this they wheeled about andran, but Dunbar was taken before heran ten yards, and Baggart had themortification to see his follow adventur¬er secured ; he once thought of boltingamong them to rescue him, but themob toas too great for him ; he wentup through the yard of the King's Annswithout meeting any body, crossed theHigh Street, and ran down the Vennel• to the Nith. He kept along the water¬side till ;he got away to the east of Cum-lungan Wood, having run nearly tenmiles in less than an hour*. He thengot on the high road to Annan. • nhe saw a post-chaise at full gallop ai t ^ostwithin 20 yards of him. Upon this tiebuttoned his coat, and leapt a hedgeinto a fieid where some people wereraising potatoes. They all joined diepolice men, who had got out of thechaise in pursuit of him ; he crossedthe lield at a slapping pace, and madefor Cumlungaa Wood; he bolted overa very deep ditch covered with briers,and ran a few steps along the siae ofthe hedge to make the police-menthink he was going into the wood ; he' them wheeled round, looted, and whenth<Y went up the one side of the ditchhe ran down the other: little did theyknow he was so near them, he couldhave breathed upon John Kiciiard-onas he passed him. In this way he cameto tne cross road which leads from theNith to the public road, and never dida fox double the hounds in better style.Hq then made for Annan, and get¬ting on a mile or two on the Carlisleroad, he went into a belt of planting.Watching an opportunity, he dived in-to a hay stack; and lay there till nextday at two o’clock in the afternoon,when he heard a woman ask a boy ifthat lad was taken who had broke outof Dumfries jail; the boy answered no,but the jailor died last night. On hear¬ing this, i/aggart- lay insensible for agood while ; he left the stack, and see¬ing a scare crow in a field, he tooksome of the old clothes and put themon to disguise himself. On the Wed¬nesday night he slept in a hay-loft; inthe morning 2 men were feeding tneirhorses, and he overheard them speak¬ing ab'out him ; he started for Carlisle,and then to Newcastle, where he stop¬ped for some days, and along with oneFleming picked in the marketfrom a man ; here he pa"sed close toJohn Richardson who was in quest ofhim, but was not noticed, //e leftNewcastle for Scotland, he got uponthe Berwick Coach, and then took aticket for Edinburgh, but only went toDunbar in the Coach, remained in Dun¬bar, and set off for Edinburgh nextmorning, met with a gentleman andtook the same lodgings with him in the16Lord Duncan Tavern, Cannongate. Af¬ter seperating from the gentleman, hestopt at Jockos Lodge with a friend ;while here he vieited his father andsome acquaintances, disguised in wo.meif’s clothes. One nignt dressed inhis own clothes, taking a walk fromPortobello to Leith, he met CaptainKoss of the Leith Police, their eyes met,and both stood motionless until Haggartfeigned to pull a pistol from his breast,the Captain knowing him too well be-fore, immediately took to his heels, andi/aggart immediately turned throughthe fieiiis, and made to Jock’s Lodge ;he then crossed the Forth, and' wentthrough Cupar to Dundee, and disguis¬ed himself in sailor’s clothes; here hecommitted a number of depredations.He then returned to jNewhaven andwent up to Edinburgh, and the first,thing he saw was a bill posted up offer¬ing a reward of 70 Guineas for his ap¬prehension, this determined him to gonorth again ; he arrived in Dandee, andfrom thence went to Perth ; he attendedthe fairs in Perth, Dunkeld, Kenmore,&c. and robbed some Cattle-Dealers to at17considerable amount. One night in hislodgings in’Perth, 2 policemen camein upon him, but the determined man¬ner in which he received them, madethem hesitate in apprehending, andJ/aggart gained an opportunity to es¬cape ; he left Perth for Glasgow, andmade up his mind to go to Ireland, hestarted in the Steam Boat; here he wasrecognised by the Provost of Kirkaldy,who went ashore at Lamlash, Haggartwas ready to jump overboard, but theboat went off without the Provost; helanded in Belfast where he attendedfairs, &c. and was in continual scenesof robbing, knocking down, &c. AtDrum more market he was seized andtaken before a magistrate ; he was ask¬ed what name be had, he answered iahigh Tipperara, it was John M'Colgan,from Armagh ; he was cross examined,and shewn a Dublin paper with a des¬cription of his person, &c. he deniedbeing a Scotsman, and passed off thebrogue so well that the magistrate wasin doubts, but he was ordered to be de¬tained, and three yeomen sat in thecotirt-house to guard him j he plied18them so well with drink, that he pre¬vailed on them to let a Voung womanbring him some supper, and when shecame, he got leave to speak with herpri vately behind the boxes of the court,where there is a large window, he bolt¬ed right thro’ the window without beinghurt by the fall: he crossed the street,and into an entry, where he saw hiskeepers below the window starmg ateach other; he started ior Belfast andthen to Dublin, and paid his passagefor America at the Pigeon house, butmeeting in with one called O’Brien, hechanged his mindj here he robbed aman of 100 guineas in gold, and jaunt¬ed thro* the country in Cars with wo¬men of bad fame ; he was taken up forrobbing a drover at Downpatrick, andput into jail, where he saw more scenesof wickedness than ever he had witnes¬sed all his life ; the women’s room wasimmediately above the men’s, and 8days’ provision was served out to themat one time ; they blocked op the doors,made a hole betwixt the 2 apartments,and kept possession in the most riotousmanner ; before his trial he bribed the19drover not to swear he was the person,and he was banished for 7 years; injail he was visited by the magistrate ofDrummore, who ordered the jailor toput him in strong irons.iTaggart denied that he had eygrbeen in Drummore and said his namewas O’Brien & not M'Colgan ; he wasmoved to Kilmainham jail among othercriminals ; here he made ins escape, butwas catched by some of the prisonersinforming the jailor of hie designs.Next day the whole of the prisonerswas called out into the court yard, andin a few minutes John Richardson fromDumfries made his appearance, and be¬gan his examination, he passed himonce, but upon a second look-over herecognized him. and said, Davie, do youken m*_, f/aggart turned to the jailor,and in a master-piece of Irisn brogue,said, what does the man say. Don’t youknow him, was the answer, he said hedid not, but John persisted that he did.On the 2d day he was put in irons, andconducted by John and an Irish Officerto Dumfries. They were 3 days- and3 nights on the road, and he experien-20ced great kindness from the officers.On their approach to Dumfries, thou-sands of people met them with torchesin their hands. From Dumfries he wasconveyed to Edinburgh jail, and plac-ed under the care of Captain Sibbaid,who he said was the kindest jailor inthe world. He was tried on the 11thof June, and the Jury gave in a verdictof guilty; when the Judge was passingthe sentence, he said he grew dizzyaud gasped for breath ; he was carriedback to jail, where he behaved in themost penitent manner, and xvrote a his¬tory of his life for behoof of his father,from v'hich this narrative is a faithfulextract.21EXECUTION.Early on the morning of his execu¬tion, David ifaggart joined earnestly fin devotional exercise with his minis¬terial attendant. After the Chaplainof the Jail had given a prayer, one ofthe officers of justice appeared, and re¬quested all the persons present to re- *’tire, as he had something to commun¬icate to the unhappy prisoner. Hag.gart immediately exclaimed in a hur¬ried tone, “ Oh ! I suppose it is the ex-ecutioner.” His firmness for a mo¬ment abandoned him, and he walkedrapidly across the cell, with his armsfolded, and with dark and deep des¬pair strongly painted on his counten¬ance. He speedily however, regainedhis composure: and when the execu-S2tioner did appear, at once allowed hisarms to be bound, he was then removedto a hall in the lower aart of the Lock¬up-house, where he wtre received by twoof the clergymen*if Edinburgh, and themagistrates. After prayers, the pro¬cession proceeded to the scaffold. Theconduct of the unfortunate youth therewas in the highest degree becoming."While the benificial influence of reli¬gion was apparent in his whole demea-nour, his natural firmness of characternever for a moment forsook him; hekneeled down, and uttered an earnestprayer, and, after addressing a fewwords of deep and anxious exhortationto the great multitude by which he wassurrounded, he met his fate with thesame intrepidity, which distinguishedall the actions of his short, but guiltyand eventful life.23The following song was made by Hag-gart the day after his condemnation;but his mind soon changed to a moreserious subject, and his whole deport¬ment was extremely pious.Able and willing, you will me find.Though bound in chains, still free inmind ;Tor with thesethings I’ll ne’er be griev’d,Although of freedom I’m bereav’d.I am a rogue, I don’t deny.But never liv’d by treachery;And to rob a poor man I disown,But them that are of high renown.Now, for the crime I am condemned,The same I never did intend.Only my liberty to take,As I thought my life did lie at stake.No malice in my heart is found.To any man above the ground.Now, ail good people that s k ofjfce, *You may say I died for my ^jrty. ?jAlthough in chains you see me fast,No frown upon my friends you’ll cast, ;7or my relations were not to blame,And I brought my parents to grief and jshame.Farewell relations and friend* also.The time is come that I must go;As for foes, I have but one,Bat to the same I’ve done no wrong.

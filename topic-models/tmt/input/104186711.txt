prepanj thee to die,my blood it rune cold at the sound.4THE MAID OF THE MILL.• I’ve talk’d and prattle’d to fifty maids,And chang’d them as oft, do you see;I’ve talk’d, &c.But of all the fair maids that dance on the green,The Maid of the Mill for mo.The Maid of the Mill for me.There’s fifty young men hare told me fine tales.And call’d me th.ir fairest she;There's fifty young men, &c.But of all the gay youths that sport on the green.Young Harry’s the lad for me,Young Harry’s the lad for me.Her eyes are as black as the sloe in the hedge,Her cheek like the blossom in May ;Her eyes, Arc.Her teeth are as white as the new-shorn Hock,Her breath like the new»made hay :The new-made hay, the new-made hay,Her breath like uie new-made hay.He’s tall and straight, like the poplar tree,His cheeks are as fresh as a rose;He’s tall and straight, &c.fie leeks like a Spuire of high degree,When dress’d in his Sunday,s cloths,When dress’d in his Sunday’s deaths.With hugging and kissing to church we will go,And he marry’d and lanquish no more ;With hugging and kissing, &ctThe bells they shall ring, and the music shall play,'The Maid of the Mill will ancore.The Maid of the Mill will nncore.DESPAIRING MARY.Mary, why thus waste thy youth time in sorrow?See a‘ around you the flowers sweetly blaw,Blythe sets the sun o'er the wild clifts o' Jura,Blythe sings the mevis in ilka green shaw, ;How can this heart e’er mair think o’ pleasure,Simmer may smile but delight I have nane ;Cauld in the grave-lies my hearts ! only treasure,Nature seems dead since my Jamie is gane.This ’kirchief he gave me a true lovers token.Dear, dear to me, was the gift for his sake,1 wear’t near"my heart, but this poor heart is brokenHope died wi’ Jamie, and left it to break.Sighing for him, I lie down in the e’ening.Sighing for him, 1 awake in the morn.Spent were my days, 3 in sepret repining,Peace to this bosom can never return.Oft have we wandered in sweetest retirement,'1’elling our loves 'neath the moon’s silent beam*;Sweet were our meetings of tender endearment,But fled are these joys lik.% a fleet passing dream ;6Gruel remembrance 1 ah, who wilt thou wreck me.Brooding o’er joys that for ever are flown,Cruel remembrance ! in pity forsake me,Flee to some bosom where grief is unknown.A PATRIOTIC SONG,TUK*—J05NY COPI.M'S Brethren, now we're met again,To show what spirit we maintain,And that we ever are the same,To meet the French in the morning,CHORUS.Then Bonaparte are ye waking yet,Or are your boats all ready yet,;Uponjfour shores, when ye think fit,We’ll meet ye in the morning.Tho’ many powers you have undone,And nearly Europe over-run.The reason’s obvious as the sun,They Jay o’er lang in the morning.Then Bonaparte, &c.You’re well aware it is the case.Where’er you saw a British face,You’ve found it to your sad disgrace.That they should rise in the morning.Then Bonaparte, &c.1Some of our patriots, in the dark,May try to aid you in your warkBut, muzzl’d, they can only bark,And loungers prove in the morning.Then Bonaparte, Sc. .Tour piteous measures to fulfil,Against our trade you try your skill JBut that won’t bring tn your willWhile we can rise in the morning.Then Bonaparte, See*My Brethren, then, just to displayOur sentiments on such a day,Permit, me, in your name, to sayWe’ll meet the French in the morning.Then Bonaparte, &c.NOBODY COMING TO MARRY ME.liASt night the dogs did bark,I went to the gates to seeWhen every lass had her spark,but nobody comes to me.And its O dear what shall become of me I0 dear what shall I do!Nobody coming to marry me,nobody coming to woo.Last time that I went to my prayers,1 pray’d for half a day,L8Come cripple, come lime, come blind,come somebody, take me away.For its O dear, <&c.My father’s a hedger and ditcher,my mother does nothing but spin;And I am a handsome young girl,but the money comes slowly in.For its O dear, *c.They say I am beautious and fair,they say I am scornful and proud :Alas !

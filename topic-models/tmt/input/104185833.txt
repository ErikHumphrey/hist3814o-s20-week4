The Athenians banilhed Prota¬goras both from their city and country, and cauferlhis books to be publicly burnt, becaufe in one ofthem he feemed to doubt of a Deity: neither were;they lefs fevcre toward Diagoras, firnamed <Tb£Atheijl, who being juftly accufed of Atheifm, tiedfor fear of punilhment; upon which they pro-] claimed, That luhcfoever did kill him, Jhould have atalent cf fiver in recompense, which is as much asfix hundred crowns: how much more then Is theCHAP.

But let fuchniad and brutilh wretches know, that they fhallone day be convinced of their folly, when it is toolate: and they may likewife find by the followinginftances, which are of undoubted truth and cer¬tainty, that the divine juftice doth fometimes exe¬cute his fevere judgments upon them in this world,and makes them monuments of vengeance for de¬terring others, that they may hear, and fear, and dor,o more fo ivickedly.I. A certain blafphemous wretch being drinkingand merry at a common inn among his companions,afked them, Whether they thought a man «was pojfejfed•with a foul or no ? To which fome of them replied.That the fouls of men were immortal, and that fomeof them after their releafe from the body lived inheaven, and that others were condemned to hell, as weare taught from the writings of the holy prophets andapojlles; but he replied, and fwore, He did not be¬lieve the foul did ftrvive the body, but that heaven andhell were mere fables, invented by cunning priejh toprocure money; and as for his part, he would fell hisfoul to any perfon who would buy it. Then one ofhis companions took up the cup, and faid, Sell methy foul for this cup of wine, which he confented to,and drunk it off: now the devil himfelf was therein the fhape of a man (as he is commonly not farfrom fuch debauchees) who bought it again of theperjured Perfons, B!afphernersy &c. 7other man at the fame price j and ft»on after pe¬remptorily demanded his foul ; the whole companyaffirming it was fit he fhould have it, lince hebought it, not knowing who it was that alked it :but on a fudden this infernal merchant laid hold ofthis wretched foul-feller, and carried him into theair before them all, toward his own habitation, tothe great aftoniffiment and amazement of the fpec-tators, and was never after heard of; but no quef-tion found to his coft that men had fouls, and thathell was no fable, contrary to his profane and fenfe-lefs opinion.—Difcipul. de temp. Serin. 132.II. Not inferior to the former was the impietyof one, not many years fince in this nation, calledMarlin, a fcholar by profeffion, brought up fromhis youth in the univerfity of Cambridge, and after¬wards a fcurrilous poet and playmaker, who givingthe reins to his wit and fancy, ran into fuch ex¬tremes, that he denied God, and Jefus Chrill, andblafphemed the Trinity, not only in words, but asit is credibly reported, writ books againft it, affirm¬ing our Saviour to be a deceiver, and Mofes a fe-ducer of the people, and the holy Scriptures to bebut vain and idle ftories, and all religion to be onlya politic cheat and device : but heaven, by an emi¬nent judgment, foon flopt the mouth of this blaf-phemer; for it happened, that as he intended tohave ftabbed a perfon whom he had malice againft,the other perceiving it, avoided the ftroke ; andwithal catching hold of his wrilf, he ftabbed inhis own dagger into his own head, which woundedhim in fuch a terrible manner, that notwithftand-ing the immediate help of chirurgery, he died foonafter, and that in a very fad condition; for hecurfed and blafphemed to the laft gafp; ami hislaft breath paffed out of his body with an horrid8 Dreadful Judgments upon Atheifisyoath, to the great terror of all that beheld him;and herein did the divine juftice remarkably appear,in that his own hand, which had written thofeblafphemies, was made an inftrument to punifhthat head and brain, which had lb wickedly devifedthem.—Beards Theatre.III. In the year 1527, a young Italian, efteemeda man very brave, and valiant in arms, was to fightwith another young man, who (becaul’e he was me¬lancholy, and fpake very little) was called Forche-bene ; they went together with a great company tothe place appointed, which was without the portof St. Gall ; whither being come, a friend to theformer went to him, and laid, God give youth vie- jtory; the proud young man adding blafphemy to :his temerity, anfwered. How Jball he chufe but giveit to me : they came to ufe their weapons, and aftermany blows given and taken both by the one andother ; Forchebene being come as the minifter andinftrument of God, gave him a fudden thurft inthe mouth, with fuch force, that having faftenedhis tongue to the pole of his neck (where the fwordwent through above the length of a fpan) he madehim immediately fall down dead, the fword re¬maining in his mouth, to the end that the tonguewhich had fo grievoufly offended, might even inthis world endure punifhment for fo horrible a fin.—L. Remys confid. c. 59.IV. Another of our own nation is not to be’overpafled, who for Atheifm may be compared tothe former, and for God’s fevere judgment uponhim, may give place to none: it was a gentlemanin Berkfhire, whofe name I forbear lo mention jthis man had a great eftate, but was an open fcof- .fer, and contemner of all religion i a profeft A-perjured Perfons, Blafphenters, &c. 9^heift, and a (corner of the word and facraments,inldmuch that I have heard it very credibly report¬ed, that being witnefs to the baptifing of a child,he would needs have it named Beelzebub. He waslikewife given to all manner of debauchery, keep-! ing feveral notorious ftrumpets openly in his houfe,without (hame: he was fo accuilomed to fwearing,that he could fcarce fpeak without an oath. Thismiferable man (or rather brute) having continued! long in this damnable courfe of life, at laft divine! vengeance found him out, for going one day ahunting with one of his comrades; as they were1 difcourfing of divers idle ftories, it pleafed Almighty! God to ftrike him with fudden death; for fallingj fuddenly on the crupper of his horfe, backward, hewas taken oft" (lark dead, with his tongue hangingout of his mouth, in a very fearful manner, and be¬came a terrible example of God’s juftice againft allwicked Atheifts.—Beard's Theatre.V. Cluvine, an author worthy of credit, whoprofefleth that he had this relation, not only byhearfay, but from eye-witnefies, who faw it, givesthis wonderful account, That in the month ofMarch, 1632, there lived nigh the borders ofMufcovia a nobleman, by office a gatherer of tri¬bute or taxes, by name Albertus Perofcius; hismanner was, when poor men could not prel'entlypay their taxes, to dirtrain upon their cattle, anddrive them to his own home: now it came to pafs,that this nobleman being from home, loft all hisunjuft gains in one night; for all his cattle, boththole he had taken by violence, and whatj he hadpurchafed with his money, fuddenly died. Thiswretched man coming home, was told by his wifeand fervants what a fearful judgment from Godwas befallen him, whereat he began to rage and19 Dreadful Judgments upiti Atheijlixrave extremely 5 and taking his mufquet, (hot it upagainft heaven, breaking forth into thefe blafphe-mous fpeeches, Let him that hilled my cattle devourthem : if thou wouldjl not let me eat them, eat them thy-felf: upon thefe furious barkings againft God, therefell fonie drops of blood, and this wicked man wasturned into a black dog, and howling he ran to thedead cattle, and began to feed upon them ; and forought I know (faith mine author, who wrote thisaccount prefently after) is yet feeding upon them.His wife, great with child, being greatly aftonifhed,and terrified with the ftrangenefs of God’s fuddenand awful judgments, fliortly after died.—Clark'sExam. 1 Part.VI. Simon Churmay in 1201, having moft fub-tilly and acutely difputed about the Trinity fomeof his familiar friends perfuaded him to put it intowriting, that fo the memorial of fuch excellentthings might not be loft ; whereupon he proudlybrake forth into this Atheiftical fpeech, O Jefule,Jefule, &c. O little Jefus, little Jefus, how muchhave I confirmed and advanced thy law in this quefiion !but if I had a mind to deal crojly, I know how withfironger reafons and arguments to weaken and difprovethe fame : which was no fooner fpoken, but he was{truck dumb; and not only fo, but he became anidiot, and ridiculoufly foolifh, and was made a com*mori hifiing and mocking-ftock to all that faw him.—Mat. Paris.VII. Not much unlike this, is that of Michael,a b'afphemous Jew, who as he was banquettmgwith his companions, fell to blafpheming Chrift,and his mother, boafting. That he had gotten thevictory over the Chrifiians' God; but as he wentperjured Perfcr.s, Bla/phemerSy &c. IXiown ftairs out of the room, he fell down, andbrake his neck—Fincclius.VIII Miferable was the end of Pirietes, who writa blafphemous book, wherein he openly mocked atGod, and all religion; for he fell into moft defpe-rate dd'pair ; and notwithftanding drift watch waskept about him, yet he killed himfclf.—Theat.Hrji.IX. In the year 1502, there lived one HermanusBifwick, a grand Atheift and a notable inftrumentof the devil, who affirmed, That the world never hada beginningy as foolijh Mofes dreamed; and that there•were neither angels, nor devils, nor hell, nor futurelife, but that the Jouls of men perifhed with their bo*dies; and that Jefus Chrijl was nothing elfe but a fe-ducer of the people; and that the faith of Chrflians,and whatever elfe was contained in the holy Scriptures,was mere vanity. Thefe opinions, full of Atheifmand impiety, he was lo hardened in, that he con*ftantly avouched them to the death, and was for thefame, together with his books, defervedly burnt inHolland.—Theat. Hijl.X. A certain rich man at Halberftadt in Germany,abounding with all manner of worldly happinels,he gave up his whole foul in delighting therein ;fo that he had no fenfe of heaven or religion; yea,he was fo atheiftital as to fay, That if he mightlead fuch a life continually upon the earth, he wouldnot envy thofe that enjoyed heaven, nor defire to ex¬change his condition with them : but foon after itplealed God, contrary to his cxpeftation, to cuthim off by death, and fo the pleafures which hedoated on ‘came to end. But after his deaththere were feen fuch diabolical apparitions in his12 Dr endful Judgments upon Athe\ftsyhoufe, that no man tJurft inhabit it, {o that it be¬came defoiate: for every day there appeared theform of this epicure, fitting with a great manyguefis, drinking, caroufing, and making good cheer;the table being furnifhed feemingly with all man¬ner of delicacies, and attended on by many perfbns,together with fidlers, trumpeters, and the like, iothat whatever he delighted in while he was alive,was there daily to be feen, God permitting Satanto deceive mens’ fight by inch appearances, to de¬ter others from living in fuch a courfe of Atheifmand impiety.—Theat. Hijl.XI. At a village called Benarides in Spain, twoyoung men (one whereof wras noted to be an outra-gious fwearer and blafphemer of God’s holy name)being together in the fields, on a fudden there arofea terrible tempeft of rain and wind, accompaniedwith fo impetuous a whirlwind, that it amazed allthat beheld it ; the two young men feeing it furi-oufly coming towards them, to avoid the dangerran away as fait as they could pofiibly; but not-withftanding their hafte, it overtook them, and forfear it fhould carry them up into the air, they fellflat down upon the ground, where the whirl-windvvhifked about them for fometime, and then pafledforward : one of them arofe fo affrighted, and infuch an agony, that he was fcarce able to (land onhis feet; the othy lying ftill without motion, fomethat flood under an hedge hard by, came to feehow he did, and found him to be (lark dead, notwithout fome wonderful fymptoms of divine juf-tice ; for all his bones were fo crufhed, that thejoints of his legs and arms were to be turned everyway, as though his who'e body had been made ofmofs; and befides, his tongue was plucked outby the roots, and could not by any means be found,perjured Per Jons y Blnfphemers, &c. 13though it was diligently fought for ; and this wasthe miferable end of this wretched youth, whowas made an example to the world, of God’s ven¬geance againft fwearers and blafphemers.— Beard'sTheatre.XII. Martiques, governor of Brittany in France,in the war againft the Proteftants, perluaded themto yield to the king, fince their flrong God had nowforfaken them, and fcoffingly faid, It tvas timefor them to frig, Help us now, 0 Lord, for it is time ;but he foon found that their ftrong God was ableto defend them, and to confound the proud andinfolent, he himfelf being prefently after llain in thefiege.—Adis and Mon.XIII. It is related in ecclefiaftical hiftory, that,when the emperor Julian was fetling out upon hisParthian expedition, he threatened to perfecute theChriftians with the utmoft feverity, as foon as hereturned victorious. Upon this occafion, Libanius-the rhetorician, afked one of them, with an intuit¬ing air ; What the carpenter's Jon was doing, whilefuch a form hung over his followers ?—The Creator ofthe world, replied the Chriftian, whom thou difdaiu-fully callef the carpenter's Jon, is making a cojjn foryour emperor. The event proved the anlwer tobe prophetic ; for, in an engagement with the ene¬my, that royal,-but wretched apoflate, was mortallywounded ; and cried with his expiring breath, U/-dfi, O Galilae ! 1 am vanquifhed, O Galilean ! Thyright hand hath the pre-eminence !XIV. In the year 510, an Arlan bifliop calledOlympius, being in the baths of Carthage, openlyfcofted and blafphemed the holy and facred Trinity;but lightning fell down from heaven upon him threeB14 Dreadful 'Judgments upon Atheifs,times, wherewith he was burnt and confumed toallies.XV. There was alfo in the time of AlphonfusIcing of Arragon and Sicily, in an ilk toward Africa,a certain profane hermit, called Antonios, who im¬pudently and impioufly belched out blafphemousJpeeches againft our bldTed Saviour, and the Vir¬gin Mary his mother; but he was hruck with amofl: grievous and tormenting difeafe, even to beeaten and gnawn to pieces with wprms till he died,«—JEneas Sylvius.XVI. Neither hath divine vengeance left itfelfwithout witnefs againft curfers, and thole who bydenying God give themfelves to the devil ; as mayplainly appear by the following dreadful examples.A foldier travelling through Murcia, a county ofAlmaign, and finding him/elf not well, went to aninn, where be lay to recover his health, and deli¬vered to his hoftefs a- certain Turn of money whichhe had about him : a while after being recovered ofhis licknefs, he demanded his money again ; but thewoman, upon confultation with her hulband, de¬nied the receipt of any, and accufed him of wrong¬ing her, in demanding what fhe never received : onthe other fide, the foldier was much enraged, ac-cufing her of cheating him : when the man of thehoufe heard the noife, though he was privy to allbefore, yet he diflembling the matter, took his wile’spart, and thruft the foldier out of the houfe ; who,feeing himfelf thus unjufily abufed, drew his fword,and ran againft the door "with the point thereof,whereat the landlord began to cry out, Thieves,Thieves; affirming, That he would have enteredhis houfe by force, and have robbed him ; where¬upon the poor foidier was taken and caft into pri-peijured Perfons, Bla[pbemers> t^fc. i 7Ton, an 1 by procefs of law, was ready to be con¬demned to death ; but on the very day wherein thisheavy fentence was to be pronounced and executed,the devil entered into the prifon, and told the fo!-dier, That he ivas condemned to die ; neverthelefs, if he•would give him'elf body and foul to him, he would pro-inife to deliver him out of their hands. The priionerreplied, That he hud rather die, being innocent, and•without caufe, than to be delivered on that account.The devil then reprefented to him the great dangerof death wherein he was, and ufed all manner of. craft to delude him *, but finding all his argumentsuneffc&ual, he at length left over his entreaties ;j but yet promifed him both afiiftance and revengej upon his enemies for nothing ; advifing him whenl| he came to his trial, he ftiouid plead, Not guilty,l| and declare his innocence, and the wrong which he! had fuffered, and to entreat the judge to grant himI the favour, That one in a blue cap, who was in theI court, might make his defence for him ; (now this oneI‘ in the blue cap was the devil himfelf.) The foldierimmediately accepted his offer; and being called tothe bar, and indidled of felony, he prefently defired.to have his attorney, who was there prefent, toplead his cauf’e ; which being granted him, this no¬torious witty crafty lawyer began very cunningly todefend his client, affirming him, To have been falflycccufed, and confequently would be unjuflly condemned;and that his hofl did withhold the money, and had of¬fered him violence : and to demonftrate the truth ofwhat he aflerted, he reckoned up every circumftanceof the whole action ; yea, the very place where theyhad hid the money. The hoft on the other fide| very impudently denied all; wifhing withal, Thatthe devil might take him foul and body if he had the mo¬ney : this fubtle attorney in the blue cap, findingnow the advantage which he had hitherto lookedB 216 Dreadful Judgments upon Alhejlt,for, left off' his pleading, and immediately feizingupon the hoff, carried him out of the feffions-houi'e,vmd hoifted him into the air fo high, that he wasnever after feen nor heard of. And thus was thefoldier wonderfully delivered from death, to the a-ifonifhment of all beholders, who were eye-wit-neffes of this terrible judgment upon this perjured,curling hoff.— Wierus of Spirits^ lib. 3.XVII. Luther in his expofftion upon the Corin¬thians, gives this relation; That a certain de¬bauched perfon, of a very wicked life, and of fuchevil education, that at every word he fpake almoft,the devil was in his mouth; for which practice,though he was often reproved by his neighbours,and exhorted to correct and amend fo vile and de-teftable a practice, yet it was all to no purpofe ; con¬tinuing therefore in this damnable practice, it hap¬pened, that as he- was one day palling over a bridge,he fell down, and in his fall, he cried out, Hoi/1 upwith an hundred devils, which he had no fooner ut¬tered, but the devil, whom he had called for fo oft,was at his elbow, who prefently ftrangled him, and,carried him away with him.XVItl. John Wierus gives an account alfo to thispurpofe, that in the year 1551, at Megalapole, nearVoildftat, it happened that the people being drink¬ing and carouting at Whitfuntide, a woman in thecompany commonly named the devil in her oaths,till he that had been called upon fo often, came ona fudden, and carried her through the gate aloftinto the air, before all the company prelent, whoran out in great aftonithment to fee whether hewould, tranfport her, and they obferved her hang¬ing in the air without the town ; and then fallingperjured Perfotu, BIafpkemers> &c. 17-down on the ground, they found her lUrk dead.-—IVierus,XIX. The fame author affirms, that about thistirm there dwelt in a city of Savoy, a man whowas of a very vicious converfation, and likewife agreat (wearer, who put many good men to much,(ru tiefs pains in admoniOiing and reproving him forhis wicked behaviour; for he would give no ear tothem, nor in the leaf! reform his ways : now it hap¬pened that the plague was in the city, and he wasintefted therewith ; and therefore hirnfeif, his wifeand kmfwoman withdrew tbemleives apart into agarden-houfe that he had; yet in this his extremitydid not the miniiters forfake him, but continuallyexhorted him to repentance, and to difeover to himhis grievous and manifold off nces; but he was (bfar from being moved with thefe religious admoni¬tions, that he feemed daily more and more to hardenhimi'e f in his ill courfe of ife, therefore hafleninghis own deltruft on : it happened one day as he wasfw-aring, denying God, and giving himi'e.f to thedevil, and cahing (or him with horrid vehemency ;behold the devil appeared, and 1’uddeniy fnatchinghim up, carried him into the air with great velocity,his wife and kinfwoman looking on, and law himfly over their heads : in this his fwift tranfportation,his cap fell off his head, and was found at Rofna,and himlelf was never after feen, nor heard of. Themagiftrates being advertiied hereof, came to thep ace where he was taken up, to be better informedof the truth of the report, and took the depofltionsof the two women upon oath, of what they had feenot this extraordinary affair. By this we may fee theterrible, yet juft vengeance of God upon (uch fin-lurs; ami it may be a warning to thole who are foinfjpireii by datan, that they cannot fpeak but they18 Dreadful Judgments upon Atheijls,muft name him, who is both an enemy to God andj| ; man, inftead of commending themfelves toGod, andI . praying for his grjce and afllftance.—John Wien/su| de Spirit.XX. ' Martin Luther in his table-talk mentionsIf! this remarkable hiftory : There was a Popifh prieft,who had formerly been a Froteflant, and apolfatized£o Popery, as Adam BuJiffina teftities: this prieftthundered out moll bitter curies againft Luther inthe pulpit, preaching at a town called Ruthner-wald -, and among the reft he wifhed. That if Lu¬ther's doctrine were true% a thunderblot might Jlrike himto death : now about three days after, there arofe amighty tempeft with thunder and lightning, whereatthis curfed prieft was extremely afraid, his guiltyi confcience accufihg him, that he had fpoken moilfalfely and malicioufly againft the truth, and there¬upon he ran with all fpeed into the church, andthere fell to his prayers before the altar ; but thevengeance of heaven foon found out and punifhedhis hypocrify; for he was there ftruck with light¬ning, and though they with much difficulty reco¬vered life iu him, yet as he was led homeward thro’the church-yard, another fiafh fell upon him in fucha manner, that he was burnt from the crown of thehead to the foie of the foot, as black as a fhoe, dy¬ing with a manifeft mark of the divine juftice uponhim—Luther's Col. Men.XXI. Theodorus Beza gives an account of twonotable inftances of the feverity of God’s judgmentupon a curier, and a perjured perfon, of his ownknowledge. I knew, laid he, a 'man in France,of good underftanding, well inftru&ed in religion,and a mailer of a family, who in his anger curling,and bidding the devil take one of his children, had1perjured Perfo/is^ Blafphemers, &>c. 19prefently his wifli anfwered, for his child was im¬mediately poffefFed with an evil fpirit, from whichthough by the fervent and continued prayers ofgood Chriftians, he was at length releafed, yet erehe had fully recovered himfelf he died.The like we read to have happened to a woman,whom her hufband, in a great rage, devoted, wi;hbitter curfes, to the devil, upon which Satan imme¬diately aflaulted her, and robbed her of her wits, fothat fire could never be recovered.Another awful example, faith he, happened notfar hence, even in this country, upon a perjurer,who forefwore himfelf, intending thereby to preju¬dice and deceive another; but he had no foonermade an end of his falfe oath, ere a grievous apo¬plexy feized upon him •, fo that without ever fpeak-ing one word more, he foon after miferably died.—.Beza> Homilia.XXT. Strange and terrible is that which hap¬pened at Noeburg in Germany, to a fon who wascurfed by his mother in her anger, wifhing, andpraying to God that Ihe might never fee him returnalive; which accordingly happened ; for the fameday the young man bathing himfelf in the water,was drowned, and never returned to his motheralive, according to her ungodly wilh.—Theat.

Henry Earl of Schwartzenburg, througha corrupt notion, ufed commonly to wilh he mightbe drowned in the privy, and as he wiflhed, lo ithappened to him ; for in the year, 1148, he beingin St. Peter’s cloifter, in the city of Erford, withFrederick emperor of Germany the emperor hadoccafion to go to the privy, whither he was fol¬lowed by fome of his nobles, and Schwartzenburgamong the reft, when ftuidenly the floor that wasta Dregful Judgments upon Athcijlf,under them beg^n to the emperor immediatelytook hold ot the iron grates of a window where¬at he hung by the hinds till fome p-rfons came andrelieved him from his peri'ous iiiuation ; fome ofth ‘ gentlemen tell to the bottom, and were drown¬ed ; and amonglt or'urs, this fa i Het.ry, Eari ofSchwartz nburg —Wattley HJt Man.XXIV.

Lamentable is the relation of what happenedin Holland in June l63-i, as it is written byTheodorus Pa!udamy.s, a Proteftant minifter atLewarden in Friezland, which mayfervefora ter¬ror to all wretched fvyearers and drunkards*; a per¬son named Dowee Sitfes, a mafon in that country,being reported to be in a defperate condition, I ac¬companied a gentleman who was fent to him byorder from the lords of the provincial, where wefound two matter chirurgions, and their two fervants bufy in making plaitters, and drefling the pa¬tient, and he in fuch a lamentable condition, aswe could not behold but with amazement, his hairwas burnt off his head to his ears; his whole faceburnt except his eyes, his arms burnt in federalplaces, his hands to the ends of his fingers wereburnt like a roafted fowl, but could move all hisfingers, his breatt and back burnt in feveral places,and yet his ihirt whole, his belly under the navel,for about the breadth of an hand was as black as aperjured Perf;as, Blafphemcrs, Ipc. 39(lock, in which phee the chirurgions made feveralincifionsj and he felt it not, h:s privities, hips,thighs, and legs were terribly burnt, yet not hisflockings, his feet wrre ail'd burnt, and indeed nopart was free, lb that he was a woful fight: Afterthe patient was dreft. and had got a little breath,both he and his wife gave a full abcount 6f thefollowing pall ages upon oath k, upon'the 15th ofJune at evening, this Dowee Sitfes came-drunk in¬to a tavern, where he with the man of the hoyi'e,and another drank three quartsrof wine, ami com¬ing home at ten at night, he lay down to fieep up¬on cufliions in the kitchen, and fell into a dreamabout a ftory he had read in a book of Simon deUries, of a certain company that daheed in mafejue-.rade, with every one a lighted torch in their hand,wherewith they burnt one another; whereupon hewaked, and flood up, thinking to go into the yardjj to make water, and of a fudden he found himfelfof a light flame in the midft of the room, which■ burnt him thus dreadfully, and fome part of his: cloaths; upon which he cried out for help, but nonecame; then he began to faint, and in his uiftrefs« cried out; O God, be gracious unto me a poor /inner,f and thereupon the flame ceafed in the twinklingof an eye; but he growing faint, laid his head up¬on a cufliion in the room. About two in the morn¬ing his wife came down and found him in this fadcondition, and felt ibmething under her feet, whidiwas like a parcel of red allies and burnt rags, andtaking hold of her hufliand, had only a burntpiece of his fleevi in her hand, • whereupon fhecries our, O Lord, Dov'fe, '■ thou art grievau/yburnt: he anfwered, The devil hath brought vie inthis cafe, upon which fhe called in the neighboursand chirurgions; his wife laid he had been muchgiven to druukennefs, and often reproved in vainD 240 Dreadful Judgments upon Atk<'f.s%by the minifttrs ; that he drank much brandy, andother Arong liquors, though he had often fwornagainft it, and ufually curfed himfelf, Wifl/mg tinttf hf were drunk again, tie devil might tear himlimb from limb, lb that God made ule of the devilas an executioner of his judgment to bring themiferable man’s own curfe upon him, not onelimb or member being left upon him.—Drunkardforewarned.LIV. Remarkable is the relation, of undoubtedcredit, (and with which we fliall conclude thischapter) of the dreadful judgment that happenedupon one John Duncalf, of Kings-Swinford in Staf-fordfhire, who in January 1677, coming to thehoufe of Humphrey Baby at Grangewel', aboutthree miles from Wolverhampton, he begged of thewoman visuals and drink, who formerly knowinghim, and compaffionating his condition, freely gaveit him; but while fhe was {looping to draw himfome drink, he ftole her bible, and fold it after-wards for three {hillings, to a maid not far off,whereby the woman came to hear of it, and payingher the money, received it again, but could nothear what was become of the man; but a while af¬ter John Duncalf hearing it difeourfed, that he ftolea bible, grew very angry, and gave out theatningwords againft a young man that reported it; but be¬ing feverely charged with it, he did not only deny itwith fome fiercenefs, but execrated, and curfedhimfelf, wifhing Ids - hands might rot off of it weretrue, which words he had no fooner uttered, butby his own confefiion to divers that came to feehim in his miferable condition, he faid, That im¬mediately thereupon he had an inward horror andtrembling upon him, a dread and fear of the divinemajejly and juflice of God; which fear and work-perjured PerfotiSy Blafphefilers &c. 41j! of his confeicncey continued many days nfler'and being alke>l upon this ingenuous acknowledg-|i ment, ivhy he did not confefs his wiciednefSy and en-I deavour that the Bible might be rejlored to the oiun-| try he anfwered, Phe devil and his oaOn heart wouldI not fujjfer hint; but acknowledged, That within a! few days after his citrftn* himfelf, his fiefs began toi look black at the wrifis of his bands, and fo continu¬ed divers weeks before it did fenfibly rot, when hejj finding himfeif weak and faint, and fearing an[! ague, was going to his acquaintance, but not be¬ing able to go further, he laid himfdf down in abarn, and there continued two days and nights;| before he was found, front whence he was remov-iti ed to another barn near Wolverhampton, and had a■ | keep?r appointed him •, his flefh began firft to rifeijj in great knots and lumps at his wrifts and knees,| and to break and run, and after to ihrink from theo j bones, at which time white putrid matter cameI out abundantly, caufing exquifite pain and tor,'SI inent, and the fmell was fo offenlive for feverati; weeks together, that thofe who came to vifit him:i |i (who were many thoufands) were not able to abideI the place, nor Ifand near without door, except theyhad herbs, or other things to fmell to : after this|| many little worms came out of his rotten fleih, and• foon after both his legs fell off at his knees, andj then both his hands; he conldantly acknowledgingit to be the jull judgment of God for this< fearfulcurling of himfelf, and for all his other fins, de¬firing the prayers of fome reverend divines, whoBcame to vifit him in his mifery, That God wculdgive him repentance, and pardon his fins of idlenefs,fiealing, lying, curfing, fwearing, drunkeunefs, un¬clean thoughts, and confiant profanenefs, and thathe would fave him for Cbrifi s fake, and give himpatience in the mean time. Thus he continued aD 3The miferablt Ends ofdreadful fpeftacle of divine juftice for fome week^,and then died, and may be looked upon as a monu¬ment of God's feverity, and that although fentenceagainji every evil work is net always executed fpeedi-ly, yet God leaves not himfelf without witnefs inthis, as well as in former ages againll atheifm andimpiety; and particularly, againfl blafphemtrs,1 coffers, fwearers, curlers, and perjured perfons,as manifeftly appears by the foregoing dreadfulexamples.The miferable ends of Magicians, Conjurers,and Witches: With an account of Appa¬ritions, Poffeffionsy and other Jlrange andwonderful Feats and Illujions of 'the Devil.HAT there are really magicians, conjurers.and witches, who have commerce, and fa-miliatity, with evil fpirits, is fo clear and plain, bothfrom holy Scripture, councils, canons and civillaws in all 'nations, that none but thole Atheiftswho would endeavour to perfuade themfelves thereare no fpirits, and confequently no other life afterthis, ever denied it; but fince the reality of thisconverfe with demons, and their appearances, andpoiTeffions has been fo clearly demonftrated informer ages, but efpecially in this, by perfonsof moft acute judgment and learning, wherein theyCHAP.

Saul, the firlt king of ifrael, being much dif-Sturbed in mind for fear of the army of the Phili-flines, which came againlt him, wou'ul by all meansknow aforehand the iffue of this doubtful war, nowI whereas before, whillt he performed the duty of agood king, and obeyed the commandments of God}, he had cleanfed his realm of witches and inchanters;3 yet he is now io fenfelefs, as in his extremity to afkcounfel of them, adding this wickednefs to all thereft of his fins, that the meafure thereof might befull; he went therefore to a witch to know his fate,I who taufed a devil to appear to him in the {tape ofSamuel, and foretel him of God’s juft judgmentupon him in the final ruin and deftruCUon of himfelfand his family.II. An example not much unlike this in the event‘ we find recorded of Natholicus, the thirty-firft kingof the Scots, who after he had unjuftly ufurped| the crown and feepter, and by much bloodfhedhad obtained the throne of that kingdom without. | any legal right or title thereunto, he endeavoured44&Tl. e iniftrablt Ends ofby the fame means to confirm and eftabSifh the go- jvernment to himfelf, and therefore, as guilt is al¬ways accompanied with fufpicion and fear, he fentone of his truftieft fervants to a witch, to enquire |of things to come, both how long he fliould enjoythe crown, and how many years he fhould live;the witch anfwered, That he fuould not live long)but j/jould Jhortly be murdered) not by his enemybut by his familiar friend; and when the mefTengerwas very earnefi: to know who fliould kill him, fheanfwered, He himfclffhould do it; the man at firftheard this with deteffation, abhoring the thoughtof any fuch villany, yet at length conlidering that ,it was not fafe to. difeover the witches anfwer, andon the other fide that it could not be long conceal¬ed, he refolved, for his own fecurity, rather to killthe tyrant with the favour of many, than to favehim alive with the hazard of his own head; there¬fore as foon as he was returned home, he defired !the king that he might fpeak with him in privateabout the witch’s anfwer, and there he fuddenlyflew him, and gave him his juft defert, both forhis horrible cruelty, and wicked forccry. Let allthofe that make no confcience of running to witch-j es, either for loft goods, recovery of their own orfriends health, or upon any other occafion, remem¬ber this example, either for their inftruction to a- :mend, or for their terror if they continue that de- !vililh practice.—Buchan, hijl.

As divers very worthy authors have credi¬bly related feveral wicked a<ftions committed bymagicians, and witches, fo feme of them have re¬corded the manner of their entering themfelves into,that curfed profeffion, and the ceremonies there¬of, as they have been difeovered by thofe who haverenounced thofe deteftable pra&ices, which it maydivert Sf.igL-ians and Witchet. 45r not be ui'prop- r h;re briefly to relate. The vvi-I zar-Js and witches being met at a piace and tinteI appointed, tlie devil there appears to them in hu¬ll man fhipe, admonifhing them to be faithful,ii and promiflng them fuccefs and length of lift ;then thofe that are prelent recommend the perfonwho is to be entered; the devil then requireshim to Knoui ce the Chriftian faith, and facra-ments, and giving him his hand, teiis him thatthis alone is not fuflkent, but that he mull vvor-flrp him likewife, and give himfelf to him bodyi and foul for ever, and bring as many as poflihly hecan into the fame fociety, and that he muft prepare1 himfelf certain ointments, and then be confirmedI therein.ilV. Manlius writes, that in the year 1553, twowitches ftole a neighbour’s child, and murderingj it, cut it in pieces, and put it into a kettle to boil,1 when the forrowful mother looking for her infant,ll came by chance into the houfe, and Lund thej] limbs thereof horribly confumed, for which abo¬il minable fa£t the authors of it were burnt, havingIti confefled this their vihany.V. Another author fays, two other witches are( reported to have killed abundance of children, andthat in Germany eight witches were taken, whoconfefled they had murdered an hundred and fortyfive children in making their ointments; they area!fo reported to have each of them a fpirit or impattending on them, who are to aflid and obey themin all things, and to give them notice of their fo-lemn meetings or appointments ; at which time’, itis faid, they frparate themfelves from all company,and night beittg come, they ftrip-themfeives naked,and anoint themfeives with their ointments, thenmiferable E/uls ofare they carried out of the houfe, either by ttiewindow, door, or chimney, mounted on their imps,to their meeting-place, which is fometimes manyhundred miles'from their dwellings, where theyfind great numbers of wizards'and witches arrivedby the fame means, who all make their accuftomedreverence to Lucifer in his throne, adoring him,proclaiming him their lord, and rendering him allhonour, as their king; this iblemnity being fmilli-ed, they fit at a table, where no delicate meats arewanting to pleafe their appetites, after which theydance, and the incubufles in the fhape of propermen fatisfy the lufts of the witches, and the fuc-eubufies 1'erve for whores to the wizards; fometimesat their folemn affemblies the devil commands eachto tell what wickednefs he hath done, and accordingto the deteftablenefs thereof, he is honoured andapplauded : Thefe, and many other fuch wonderfulthings are mentioned by authors of good credit, andfeveral perfons have made confefilon, and given anaccount thereof.VI. In the year 1645, one Rebecca Jones, beingfufpe&ed for a witch, was brought before Sir Har-bottle Grimftone and Sir Thomas Bows, juftices ofthe peace for Eficx, to whom fhe voluntarily confef-fed, ‘Ihat about liventy-Jive years before, living•with one John Bifkop in that county, there came onemorning to the doer a very handfome young nun asJhe then thought, but noiv {he thinks it ivas the de¬vil, •who ajked her haw floe did, and defined to feeher left wrijl, and then he took a pin from her feeveand pricked it twice, and there came out a drop ofblood, which he took upon his fnger and departed,and going a while after to St Ofyths, Jbe met a nunin a ragged fait, with fuch great eyes, as much af¬frighted her, who came to her, and gave her three47divers Mefghians and Witches.: things like to moles, having four feet apiece, b it no| tails, and black, and bid her nurfe them till he de-| fired than again.

There was a conjurer at Saltzburg in Ger¬many, who boafted that he could gather togethert all the ferpents within half a mile round about, in¬to a ditch, and feed them, and bring them up there ;I and being about the experiment, behold the oldand grand ferpent came in the while, which whilftl he thought by the force of his charms to make en¬ter into the ditch among the reft, he fet upon him,and inclofed him round about like a girdle, foftrongly, that he drew him by force into the ditchfwith him, where he miferably died; and fo thisjuggler was couzened by the devil, who was morecunning than himfclf.—Beard’s Theatre.VIII.

It was reported, that tins wretch had given Ihimfelf to the devil, and had provided ftore of holy jbread (as they ca'led it which he always carriedabout with him thinking thereby to fccure himfelffrom him ; but it fcrved to little purpofe, as theft quel declared.IX. A' out the year 1437, Charles Vlf. beingKing of France, Sir Giles of Britain, high confta-b!e of France, was accufed for having murderedabove an hundred and threefcore infants, and wo- Simen with child, with whofe blood he writ, or cau-fed be written, books full of conjuration, hoping iby fuch abominable praftices. to obtain great pre- |ferhaent, but it happened quite contrary to his ex-pe&acion ; for being convi&ed of thefe horrible fcrimes, (it being the divine will that fuch grofs and ijhorrid iniquities Ihould not go unpunifhed) he was *condemned to be hanged and burnt to death,! <which was accordingly executed upon him at Nants 1by the authority of the Duke of Brittany.—Beard'n hTheatre.X.

There was within the memory of our fa¬thers (faith Camerarius) John Fan ft us of Cumiligon,a German, who had learned the black art at Craco-itf via in Poland, he meeting one day at the table withf fome who had heard much of his magical tricks,I was earneftly entreated by the company to fhow! them fome fport, and being overcome in the end bylit the importunity of his pot-companions, who were| alfo well armed in the head, promife'd to ftiew themu whatfoeverthey would have; they, with a generalra confent, require him to bring into the place a vineI laden with ripe grapes, ready to be gathered; for1 they thought, becaufe it was in the month of De-jS cember, Fauftus could not Ihow them that whichJwas not; yet he condefcended to them, faying.That immediately before they Jlirred from the table,1 they fjould fee the vine they defired; but upon this1 condition, that they Jhould not /peak a word, nor-offer to t fie from their places, but Jhould all tarrytill he bid them eut the‘grapes, and that ivhofoever•would do other-wife, ivas in danger to hfe his life:they having all promifed to obey him, Fauftus focharmed the eyes of thefe drunken revellers, thaC'5<?

Delrio, in his magical difeourfes, gives thisrelation: Two magicians met together in the Queenof England’s court, as I have it from unqueftionedwitnefles; thefe two agreed, that in any one thingthey fhould infallibly obey one another; the onetherefore commands the other to thrufl his headout of the cafement of a window, which he had noJb.oner done, but a large pair of flag’s horns werefeen planted on his forehead, to the great pleafurecf the fpe&ators, who joked upon him with athouland abufes and mocks; he refenting the dil*grace, and thirfling after revenge, when his turncame to be obeyed, he with a charcoal drew thelineaments of a man upon the wall, and then com¬manded the fame magician to Hand under that pic¬ture, that the wall fltould immediately give placeto receive him ; the other appreheniive of the ex¬treme danger he was in, began to beleech hun thatdivers Magicians and Witches. 53{ he would excufe him-, but the other abfolutely re-1 fufed : being therefore compelled, he ftands under!( it, and then the wall Teemed to open, and he be¬ing entered therein, was never afterward Teen more.The Tame author fets down another relation as a| matter of undoubted truth; a notable conjurer, forj a trial of his great fkill, had cut oft' the head of the; inn-keeper’s fervant where he lodged; and whenhe was about to fet it on again, he perceived hej was hindered by the prefence of .another magician,' that chanced to be by at the time: he thereforeili befought him that he would not oppofe him ; butthe other not regarding his requeft, the firlt magi-i a cian caufcd a lily to fpring out upon the top of thei| table, and when he had chopped off the head ofli it, together with its flowers, upon a fudden, downi’ll falls the magician that hindered him, headlefs toIII the ground ; that done, he fets on the head of the| fervant again, and fpeedily conveys himfelf away,I left he ftiould be queftioned for the murder of his^ rival.—Detrio Difquif.

MelanEl.XIX. Not long fince at Stetin, an univerfity ofPomerania, there was a young fludent, who, uponfame difcontent, gave himfelf to the devil, and madea bond upon the contract; which, that it might notcorns to the knowledge of any, he laid up in one ofhis books; but it pleafed God fometime after, thatanother fludent wanting that book upon fonve occa-fion, knew not where to get it, at lad he remem¬bered that fuch an one had it, and thereupon wentto him, And borrowed it of him; the young manhaving forgotten that he had put his bond into it:the other, when he came home, began to turn overdivers Magicians and Witches. 55the book, and there met with the bond; and read-n ing of it, was much affrighted ; and not knowing'| what to do, he went to Dr. Cramerus, proftffor of|j divinity in that univerfity, to aik his advice*, whoJ wifhed him to keep the bond; the other replied, HeI durft not; then laid the doctor, Bring it to rue, andi 1 will keep it. Some few nights after, as the doctor,1 was in his ftudy, the devil came rapping at his ftudydoor, faying, Cramer, Cramer, Give me my bond, for!ii it belongs to me, and thou kajl nothing to do with it; tofj whom the doctor anfwered, Satan, thou Jhalt noti.l have the bond ; thou hajl nothing to do with it; I haveiJ put it where thou canf not fetch it; jor it is in my Bible,i at the third chapter of Gendis, where thefe words are.Hi The feed of the woman foal l break the ferpent's head: up-II on which the devil went his way, taking the chain*I her window with him, and the young man neverII heard of him afterward.—Beard’s Theatre.XX. A young man at Wittenburg in Saxony,It being kept fhort of money by his father, was tempt-I ed by the devil to yield himfelf body and foul tojr him, upon condition to have his vvilhes fatisfied,Jand his neceffities fupplied; which he, being pinch¬ed with want, confented to, and confirmed it by ait bond, written with his own blood: but prefently af-.1)1 ter he began to decay in his bodily health; and be¬lli ing thereupon brought to Martin Luther, and byjij him examined, he, at length, confeffed the wholeI matter to him; which, when Luther heard, he af-j fembled the whole congregation together; and allI of them joined together, and prayed for him, where¬by the devil at laft was forced to bring the bond, andf to throw it into the window amongft them, biddingI the young man to take it to him again. On a time,|i as Luther was walking in his garden, the devil ap-| pcared to him in the Hkenefs of a black boar; but he5^ ’The imferable Ends tflighting him, and not regarding him, he vanifliedaway. Luther likevvife telleth us that when he waslodged in the caflle of Warteburg, in a chamber farfrom any company, he was many times molefted bynoifes made by the devil, in his chamber, and onthe flairs. But I (faith he) encountered him •with thatyivj/ewa’, Omnia i'ubjecifti pedibus ejus, Thou hafi putcdl things under his feet} and fo I laid me down andflept in fafety.Another of the German divines in Luther’s time,as he was fitting at his book in his ftudy, the devilappeared, looking over his ihouider, which the mi-nifler perceiving, took a piece of paper, and writ init, The Son of God came to dejitoy the •works of the devil;and fo holding up the paper, he immediately vanifli- ‘ed.—Luthery Colloq. Menjal.XXI. In the life of Mr. Richard Rothwell (a fa¬mous preacher at Mansfield, in the county of Not¬tingham, about the year 1672,) we havejthis remark¬able account, as it was drawn up by Mr. StanlyGower of Dorchefter: There was one John Fox,living about Nottingham, who had no more learn¬ing than enabled him to write and read. This manwas poflcflcd with a devil, who would violentlythrow him down, and take away the ufe of everymember of his body, which was changed as blackas pitch, while thole fits were upon him-, and then >fpoke with an audible voice within him; whichfeemed fometimes to found out of his belly, feme- I ■times out of his throat, and fometimes out of hismouth, his lips not moving; and thus he continuedfor a confiderable time; many prayers were put upto God for him, and great refort was made to him, ,efpecially by feveral famous miniflers; as Mr. Ber¬nard of Batcomb, Mr. Lanly of Trufwell, and o- ithers, betwixt whom and John Fox, there paired 1divers ^Li^uians and Witches. 55! many papers in writing, he difeovering his tempta¬tions, and they writing him aniwers, becaufc he| was i'truck dumb, as ye fhall find afterwards.Among the reft, Mr. Rothwell went to fee him,| and before he came, the devil told all that were inthe houfe of it. faying, Tonder comes .Rothwell, but I;j will make a fool of him before he goes ; whereupon thepeopie looked out, and law him coming about au quarter of a mile from the houfe : as loon as he en-f tered the room, the devil faid, How Rothwell iscome, and, as fome fay, added, Thou faye/l there is noI poffcJf’Oti; Whut thinkejl thou now ? Here is a man opens1 not his lips, and yet he fpiaketh ; and after a while he! faid, Say nothing to me of this man, for I tell thee heu is damned; and he added thereto many fearful blaf-I phemies.Rothwell. Thou art a liar and the father of liesI ': nor art thou fo well acquainted with the mind of God|! concerning this man, which makes thee thus to tormentihim ; therefore I believe thee not .• I believe he fhall befaved by Jefus Cbrijl.Devil.

It feems Mr. Rothwelis horfe hum- :bled at that place, the devil having power to caufeit, though without hurt to either horfe or mamMr. Rothwell then faid, Tboti hajl often beguiledtne, 1 hope God will i« time give me wifdom to dfcern,'and power to withjland all thy delufwns, and he it is thathath delivered me out oj thy hands, and 1 doubt not willalfo deliver this poor man; the devil then blafphemedfearfully, and quoted many feriptures out of theOld and New Teftament, both in Hebrew andGreek, cavilling and playing the critic therewith,and backing his allegations out of the fathers, andpoets, in their own language, which he quoted very ;readily, fo that the company trembled to hear fuclithings from one that underftood no learning, andneither moved tongue nor lip all the while ; but Mr, !!Rothwell was wonderfully enabled by divine powefto detefl the devil’s lophiftry; upon which the de¬vil laid, What fund I talking with thee, all men knowthou art bold Rothwell, and thou fearejl nobody, nor ca • -rejl for words, therefore I will talk to thee no more.'ibis name he carried to liis grave ; for the people'divers Magicians and Witches. 59would fay, “ This is he whom the devil cal'ed bold“ Rothwell”Mr. Rothwell turning to the people, faid, Goodpeople, you fee the goodnefs of our God, and his greatPower, though the devil made a fool of me even nousi] through my weaknefs, God hath made the devil dumb| now ; do but obferve how the man lies, therefore' let usS0 to prayer, and that God who hath made him dumb,j will, I doubt not, drive him out of this poor man.j The devil hereupon raged, blafphemed, and faid,S*' And wilt thou go to prayer, if thou doji, I will. makeI fuch a noije, that thy prayerJhall be di fir acted, and thouknowefl God will not hear a dijlraElei prayer; but thenhafl got a device, becaufe thou wilt not be dijlradied, thouiJbuttejl thy eyes in prayer, (for fo he always did) butif thou pray, l will pull out thy eyes. -Rothwel!.

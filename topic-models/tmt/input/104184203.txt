And because soni*of tho members are uncompounded, and entirethemselves, as the tongue, the heart, &c., and som<are of a mixed nature, as the eyes, the nose, andothers; we therefore say, that there are many thing]which agree and live together, that inform a wise maihow to make his judgment before he be too rash tdeliver it to the world.Hair—Hair that hangs down without curling, if ibe of a fair complexion, thin, and soft withal, signifiea man to be naturally faint-hearted, and of a wealbody, but of a quiet, harmless disposition.

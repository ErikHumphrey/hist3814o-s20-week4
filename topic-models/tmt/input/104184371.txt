He is a believer. I think none of my readerswill doubt but he has more religion than is to befound in all the prefent French Convention, thateven fome of our own coutjtiymen fnow them-felves Devils enough to admire; for befides ab¬juring God end all religion, they even refufsd therefpefl that Satan thinks he has a right to, asthey have decreed# that all the people-'of Francefliall believe death is eternal lleep ; thus puttingeven the Devil out of the queftton; but as hewifiiss to be fuprerae in that refpefk, he foonbrought part of them to the guillotine, and thereft taking the hint, fet up Paganifm, and worfhlpeven at prefent his infernal majefty under thetitle of the God of Reafon. enly intle-id of allow¬ing every feventh day to him, as they ufed to do>to God, they gave him evci-y tenth. Thus havethey and their Britifti admirers far out deviledSatan; for I can allure them their prototype theDevil i* no infidel.2. He fears God. This you have the Devil’*own ’Uthority for; and that in a confeflion againftliimfeif. x. He confefles Chrift to be the Son ofGod; but no thanks to him for that, for it doesnot need the Devil’s evidence 2. He acknow¬ledges he may be tormented. 3. He acknowledgesthat there is a time appointed when he fhall betormented. But when, and by what means thisIhall be executed, I think as needlefs, as it is im.pofiible to know on this fide the blue blanket.I will, l confefs, «ome very much within thecompafs of this part of my difeourfe, to give anaccount, or at lead to make «n cflhy towards it,of the fhare the Devil has had in the fpreadingreligion in the world; and of dividing and fubdi-viding opinions in religion; perhaps to eke it out,and make ic reach the farther; and alio to fliowhow far he is, or has msde himfelf millionary ofthe famous clan for propagating the faith. St istrue, we find him heartily employed, in almoftevery comer of the world, promulgating error*;but that may require an hiftory by itfelf.J think it no injury at all to the Devil, to faythat he had a great hand in the old holy war, a*it was ignorantly and enthufialhcally called; ftir-ring up the GhritUan princes and powers of Eur peto run a madding after the Turk* and Saracens,and make war with thefe impatient people abovea thoufand miles off, only becaufe they had enter¬ed into God's heritage when he had fairly tunedit into a common, and laid open for the nextcomer, fpending their nation’* ireafure, and em¬barking their kings and people ( I fay) in a warabove a thoufaad miles on, filling their headswith that religious madnefs, called in thofe days.Holy Zeal, to recover the Holy Land, the Se¬pulchres *f Chrift and the taints, and, as theyoalkd falfely, the Holy City, tho’ true religionfays it Tvas the accurfed city, arid not worth fpill-ing cne drop of blood for"his religious bubble was certainly of Satan,who as he certainly'drew them in, fo like a trueDevil he led them in the lurch when they camethere, faced about to the Saracens, animated theimmortal Saladdm againft them, and managed lodextroufly, that he left the bone* of thirteen orfourteen hundred thoufand Chriftians there, asa trophy of his infernal politics, and after theGhriftian world had run-all a fanta terra, or inEnglift, a fauntering about an hundred years, hedropt it to play another game lefs foolilh, but tentimes more wicked than that which went before it;namely, turning the crufadoes of the Chriftian*one againll another; and as Hudibras faid in an¬other cafe,“ Made them fight like mad or drunk,“ For Dame religion, as for punk.”Of this you have a complete account in the hif-tory of the Pope’s decrees againft the Count deThouioufe, and the Walchnfes and Abigenfcs,with the crufadoes and tnaffacres which followedupon them, wherein, to do the De/We politicsfeme juftice, he met with ail the fyccefs he coulddefire.

IfScripture-evidence may be of any weight in thequeltion, there is no room to doubt the genealogy°t the Devil. He is not only fpoken of as anangel, but as a fallen angel; one that had been inheaven, had beheld the face of God in his full ef-l gVlCi ^.S!ory> »nd furrounded the throne of1 ‘j ^7. ‘’‘ghj from whence commencing rebel,and bemg expelled, he was caft down, down«ovn, God aEd the Devil himfeif only knowwhere; for indeed we cannot fay that any mannn earth knows it; and wherever he is, he has,enee man's creation, been a plague to him—beena tempter, a feducer, a calumniator, an enemv,and the objeft of man’s horror and averfion.flow long the Devil remained wandering orconfined in chaos, or how lie employed himlelf,nillory is filer.t, and tradition lays* but little.Rabbi Judah fay?, the Jews are of opinion, thathe remained twenty thoufiancl years in that ccn»dition; end that the world would contain twentythouftndmore, in which he feall find wovk enoughto fatisfy his mifehitvous dtfires; but he fhowsno authority for. his opinions. Indeed let theDevil have been as idle as they think he was be*fore, it mull be acknowledged that he now is their.oft buly, vigilant a*d diligent of God’s crea¬tures, and very full of empfoyfeent too. iuch a*this.As the Devil’s Hifloriographer Royal has rotyet favoured ws with any publication of his infer¬nal Highnefs, w* are left much in 'the dark formatefoa’s, and i; uft draw ;htm as inferences fremthis a£Ho« and connexion*. This we are cott*vineed of, when we come tofpe&lc of his fhape, orperfonality of fubftance; and as we (hall haveoccafion to fay a good deal on that fcore after¬wards, we leave the reader, from the credibilityof the witnsfTes, to attach what degree of beliefhe pleafes to it. Only we are certain, whateverhis puiffimce is as prince of the power of the air?it is limned here, and that in tvo particulars:iirft, he is Hmitated fr >m afiuming a body, orbody fhapes with fubflance: and fecondly, fromexerting feraphic powers, and a<fling with thatfupernatural force, which as an angel he was cer-tiinly vetted with before the Fall and which weare not certain is yet taken from him: or at mott,vre do not know how much it mayor may not bediminifhed by his degeneracy, and by the blowgiven him at his expulfion. This we are certain^that be his power, greater or lefs, he is reftrainedfrom exevcifing it in this world; and he who wasonce equal to the angel who killed 180,000 menin one night, is not able now without a new com-iniffioa, to take away the life of onejob, nor touch,any thing he had.But let us confider him then limited and re¬trained as be is, yet he remains a mighty, a ter¬rible, an immortal being, far fuperiorto man as ,well in the dignity of his nature, as in the dread¬ful powers he retains till about him. It is truethe brain Gck heads of our enthufiaftics paint himblacker than he is; and as I have faid, wickedlyreprefent him clothed with ten ovs that do notreally belong to him; as if the power of goodand evil was wholly vetted in him, and that hewas pi <ed m the throne of ids Maker, to diftri-bute both puniihments end rewards, in this theyare very wrong, terrifying and deluding fanci ulpeople about him, till they turn their heads afndfright liicm into belie# that the Devil will letthem alone if they do fuch and fuch good things,or carry them away with him they knew not whi¬ther, if they do net, as if the Devil whofe properbafinefs is mifchief, i'edueing and deluding mankind,hnd drawing them in to be rebels like himfclf,fhould threaten to feize upon them, carry themaway, and in a Word fall upon them to hurt themif they did evil, and on the contrary be favour¬able £tnd civil 'o them if they did well. Onthe contrary we have a clear diicovery,x. That he is the vanquifhed, but implacableenemy of God, his Greater, who has conqueredand expelled him from the habitations of blifs;on which account he is filled with envy, rage,malice, and all uncharitablenefs; would dethroneGod and overturn the thrones of heaven, if itwas in his power.a, That he is man’s irreconciiiable enemy; notas he is man, not on his own account limply, notfor any advantage he (the Devil) can make bythe ruin and deftruttion of man; but in mereenvy at the felicity he is fuppofed to enjoy asSatan’s rival, and as he is appointed to fucceedSatan and his angels in the poffelTion of thofe glo¬ries from which they are fallen.So Satan looking narrowly into the nature andframe of our (li ft parents; from the nature ofS.ve, he bad room £b conclude, that Ihe was of acohftitblion eafy to be feduced, and efpecially byflattering her; raifing a commotion in her foul,and adifturbance among her paflions; and accord¬ingly he fet himfcli to work, to diliurb her re-pofe, and put drains of great things into herhead; together with feme thing of \ namelefsfcind, which (however fome have been ill-naturedenough to iuggeft.) I lhall not injure the Devilfo much as to mention without better evidence.But T only giro the general hint of thefe things,ns they appear recorded in the annals of Saian’sfir ft tyranny, and at the beginning of his govern¬ment in the world: thofe that rouhi be moreparticularly informed, may enquire of him andknow farther.And here, to be fure, began the Devil’s newlkingdom: as he had now Deduced the two firftcreatures, he was pretty fure of fuccefs upon allthe race; and therefore prepared to attack themalfoj as foon as they came on; nor was their en-creafing multitude any difeouragement to his at¬tempt, but juft the contrary; for he h d sgentsenough to employ, if every man and woman thatfhould be born was to want a Devil to wTaii uponthem, feparately and fim»ly, to Deduce them; where¬as fome wliole nations nave been fuch wuling lub-je£V.s to him, that one of his teraphic imps may,for aught we know, have been enough to guide awhole country ; the people being entirely fubjeft-ed to his government for many ages, as in Ame*rica for example, where fome will have it, thathe conveyed the firft inhabitants; at leaft, if hedid not, we don’t know who did, or how they gotthither.But as to the America s, let the Devil andthem alone to account for them going thither;this we are fcertain of, that we knew nothing ofthem for many hundred years; and when we did,they that went from hence found Satan in a fulland quiet pofleffion of them, rqling them with anarbitrary government, particular to himfelf. Hehad led them into a blind fubje-dion, nay, l mightcall it devotion (for it was all the religion tha.6was to be found among them); worlhipping hor¬rid idols in his name, to whom he directed humanacrifices continually to be made, till he delugedlie ca jiury with blood, and ripened them up forthe dedruftion that followed, from the invalionof the Spania. ds; whom he knew would hurrythem out of the world as faft as he (the Devilhimfelf) could defire of them.To return to the beginning of things, in themidft of his conqupfi, he found a check put to theadvantages he expedited to reap from his victory,by the immediate promife of grace to a part ofthe pdfterity of Adam, who notwithftanding thefall, were to be pur chafed by the Mtffiah, andfnatched out of his (Satan’s) hands, and overwhom he could make no final conquefl; fo thatbis phwer met with a new limitation, and thatfuch as indeed fully difappointed him in the main-thing he aimed at, viz. preventing the beatitudesof mankind; which were thus feeuced, (and whatit th<- numbers of mankind \Vere upon this accountincreaUid in fuch a manner, that the felefted num¬ber fhould, by length of time, amount to jutt Usmany as the whole race had they not fallen, wouldhave axnountfcd to in fill?) And thus, indeed thewo. id may be 'aid to be upheld and continued forthefak'of thofe few; lince, till their nun«.bercan be completed the creation cannot fall, anymove thas that without them, or but for them, itwould not have flood.Th# fecond exploit the Devil atchieved, wasabftra&ing the mind of Cain Adam s eldell fon,from his allegiance to God, who, on finding thathis brother's more virtuous facrifice was prefer¬red to his own, conceived and perpetrated the fa-tanic deed of butchering Abel. For which Godcurfed €ain, blafted his race, and drove themfrom his prefence. ‘ has the Devil too fuc-cefsfully pr-fftifed his wiles on the Antedeluvian;for tho7 oeth the third fon of Adam bad had twofons, in thofe days we find “ that men began to“ caU 'fen the name of the Lord;’' yet in tracingthe fuccetfion of blood *n the royal original lineof \dam brought down as low as Noah and histhree Cons, for it continued a /cries of 1450 years,Cay fome. 1640, fay others; in which time, finfpread itfelf to generally through the whole race;and the fons of God, fo the fcripture calls themen of the righteous feed, the progeny of Sethcame in unto the daughters of men, that is, join¬ed thetnfelves t» the curfed race of Gain, andmarried promifcuoufly with them according totheir fancies—the *omen it feems being beauti¬ful and tempting; and thsugh the Devil couldnot make the women handfome or ugly in one orother family, or either fide, fo as to make boththe men and women tempting and agreeable toone another, where they ought not to have beenfo; cad perhaps as it is often feen to this day,the more tempting for being under a legal re-ftraint. Thus having completely debauched themthe whole 1500 years, he led them to fcorn andcontemn, Noah, aad treats him as a fantaftic reli¬gious fool for building the fhip in which he andthe flock on beard were to (kip over bills and4ance over plains: but foon were they left inthe Devil s lurch; and he no doubt amazed andnonplufied to guefs what would enfuc from thisinundation.No fooner did the Devil fee the ark reftingon Mount Ararat, and Noah and his farai'y andevery living er a ure descend from it; end know¬ing all his infernal work was .to begin, that hemight again flriks at the root inftantly com¬mences with Noah, who had been a very greatpieacher; ard by mea?s of his witched chil^Canaan gets hits drunk, and fo ftopt his mouth;for we never hear of him after, though lu liveda long tinar.It would be tediou* and defultory to trace Satanthrough alt his indefatigable workings to feducemankind to devil worflup; and how completelyhe lucceeded. God called Abraham out fromamong his idol-worlhipping friends, and in hisfeed crewed a church, .in which, in fulnefs oftime, the Mefliah, who before had expelled Sa¬tan from heaven, was to appear and give hiskingdom a mortal *osnd. Nor (hall we fliowthe many defe&ions'in the brighteft luminaries ofthe church, to the coming of our Saviour, andk was, no doubt, than at a low ebb, though therewas a glorious remnant of faiflts who waited thefalvation of ifrael, and kept ■iataa at bay. Andthis was a more mortal dab to the thrones prin¬cipalities infernal^ chan the creation of man ; andtherefore with this I break off the antiquities ofthe Devil’s history, or the ancient part of hiskingdom : for from hence downward, we (hall findhis empire had declintd gradually; and thoughby his wonderful addreft, bis prodigious applica¬tion, and the vigilance and fidelity of his indru-ments, as well human as iaferpa! and diabolical;and of the human, .as well the eccjefiaflic as t heijcular, he had many times retrieved what he hadloft, and fometimes bid fair for recovering theuniveifil empire he once pofiefftd oyer mankind;ye t he has be'jn (lilt defeated agsin, repulied andbeaten back and hi* kingdom has declined in manyparts of the w orld, and efpecially in the northernts. And we (hall confuler how he has politi-• , maintained his inte-rsdl, and increafed his^dominion among the wife and righteous genera-non that we cohabit with, and among w hich is infar, the fu'ojed of the modern putt of Satan’shilioiy, and of winch we are next to give an ac¬count.The Modern History of the DEVIL.PART II.1H.WE examined the antiquities, of Satan’s hif-tory, »ni brought his affairs down from thecreation as far as our blefTed Ghriftian times; efpe-cially to the coming of the MefTuh, when onewould think the Devil could have nothing to doamong us. I have indeed but touched at fomethings which might , have admitted of a fartherdefeription of Satan’s affairs, and the particularsof which we may all come to a farther knowledgeof hereafter; yet I think I have fpoken to thematerial part of his conduit, as it relates to hisempire in this world; what has happened to hismore fublimattd government and his angelic ca¬pacities, 1 (hall have an occafion to tou.h at infeveral foil'd particular* as we go along.The Meniah was now born, the fulnefs of timv/as come that the old ferpent was to have hihead broken, that ’-i tor fay, his empire or domi¬nion over man. which be gained by the fall of ourfir 11 father and mother in paradife, received adownfal or overthrow.It is worth obferving, in order to confirm whatI have already mentioned of the limitation of Sa¬tan's power, that not only his. angelic flrengthleems to have received a farther blow upon thecoming of the Son of God into the world, but hefeems to have had a blow upon his intetle&s; hisferper.tine craft and devil-like fuotiity teem t..have been cireumcifed and cut fhort; and inlteaof his being fo cunning a fellow as before, when,as laid, it is evident he outwitted all mankind,not only Eve,. Cain, Noah, Lot, and all the pa¬triarch*. but even nations of men, and that intheir public capacity : and thereby Ld them intoabfu d and ridiculous things, fuch as the buildingof Babel, and deifying and vorfhipping their king*whendeadand rotten jidoliaing beafb,dock*,ft*»es,any thing, and even nothing; and in a word, whenhe-managed mankind juft as he pleafed.Now, and from this time forward, he appeareda weak, fooliih, ignorant Devil, compared to whathe was before. He was almoft upon every occa-fion refilled, difappointed, balked, and defeated;efpecially in all his attempts to thwart or crofsthe million miniftry of the Mefli*h while he wasupon earth, and lometimes upon other and verymean occafions too.And firft, how foolifh a projett was it, and howbelow Satan’s celebrated artifices in like cafes, toput Herod uoon fending to kill the poor inno¬cent children in Bethlehem in hopes to deftrovChrift? for take it for granted it was the Devilput it into Herod’s thoughts that exeeut>>fi, how■fimple »nd foolilb foever now, we muft allow himto be very ignorant of the nativity himfelf, orelfe he might have eafily guided his friend Herodto the place where the infant was.Thi# Uiows,,that either the Devil is in generalae ignorant as we are of what is to happen in theworld before' it is really come to pafs; and con-fequently can foreiel notbir-, no, not fo much esour famous old Merlin or mother Shipton did; orelfe that great event was hid from lum by an itn.mediate power fuperior to his, which I cannot^think neither, confidering how much he was con¬cerned in it, and how certainly he knew that itwas or.Qc to come to pafs.But be that as it will, it is certain the Devilknew nothing where Chrift was born, or when;cor was he able to direft Herod to find him out;and therefore put him upon that foolifli as well ascruel order, to kill all the children, that he mightddtroy the Meffiah among the reft.The next iitriple (lep the Devil took, and in*deed the moft foolifli one that he could ever becharged with, unworthy the very dignity *»f aDevil, and below the underOanding that he al¬ways was allowed to act with, was that of comingto tempi tire Mcffiah in the wildernefa; it is cer¬tain that the Devil knew our Saviour to be theSon of God; and it is as certain he knew, thatas {ueh he coaid have no power or advantageover him; how foolifh then was it in him to at¬tack him in that ruavner, “ If thou be the Sen of■ God?’* why he knew him to be the Son of Godwell enough; he faid fo afterwards, “ I know“ thee wh6 thou art the holy One of Ged;’’ howthen Cfuld he be fo weak a Devil as to fay, ifthou art, then do fo and fo?The cafe is plain, the Devil though he knewhim to be the Son of God, did not fully know themyftery of the incarnation; nor did he kno>* nowfar the power of Cluitl extended, and whether asi man, he was not lubjedt to fall as Adam was,though his referved Godhead might be ft ill im¬maculate and pure, and upon 'this foot, as hewoe'id leave nt* method untried, he attempts himthree times. One immediately after another; Lutthen, finding himfelf difoppointed, he died.This evidently proves, that the Devil wa; ig¬norant of the m) fiery or godlinefs, as the textcalls it, God mjuiftft in the Belli; and thereforemade that foolifh attempt upon Chrift, thinkingto have conquered his human nature, as capableof fin, which it was not; and at this repulfehell groaned; the whole army of regimented De¬vils received a wound, and felt the fl;ock of it;it was a fecond overthrow to them; they fond along train of fuccefs; carried a devil fli conqueftover the greatelt part of the sriaticr. of God;but now they were cut fhert; the feed of the wo-[ *8 ]man was aow come to break the ferpem’s head;thati*, to cut &ort his power, to.contraft thelimits of his kingdom, and in a horrible manner,whenever Chrift met with him; or elfe veryhamble and iub®iflive, as when lie begged leave. to go into the herd of fwine, a thing he has oftendone GheeDefeated here, the fird ftratsgem I find himconcerned in alter it, w.<s his entering into Jadas,and putting him upon betraying Chrifi to the chiefprielt; but here again he was entirely miSakfen;for he did not fee, as much a Devil as he vas,what the event would be; but when he came toknow that if Ohrift was put to death, he wouldbecome a propitiatory and be the great fticrificeof mankind £0 as to refeue the fallen rac^f fromthat death they had incurred the penalty of bythe fall; that this was die fulfilling of all ferip-ture prophecy; and that thus it was that Chriltwould be the end of the Jaw: I fay, as loan as heperceived this, he Grove all he could to preventit, and djfturbed Pilate’s wife in her ileep, in or¬der to fet iter upon her hufbend to hinder his de¬livering him tep totheJ*ws; for then, and nottill then, did he know haw Chrifc was to var.quiflix hell by the power of his crofs.Thus baffled and thwarted, the Devil refoldedon this truly hellifh thing called perfecution, andarmed the whole Romdlt empire againft God’sChurch; but tho' fora long time he was gluttedwith blood and fatisfied with deftru£hon, yet un¬der Conftantine the Chrillian Church was efta*bliflied and religion flouriffled in peace, whichcontinued till the days of Arias, who was zealoally oppofed by the orthodox biiliop of theKart, Athanafius, whom they banifhed and calledfeveral times, as error ran high, and as the Devifeither loft or get ground. The emperor Avian achild of the Devil, elponfrig the diabolical tenetsof arms, a violent perfecution arofe betwixt theAriars and the orthodox. So virulently didthey carry on this perfecution, that the Devilby means of the emj^ror Julian made one pulhfor eftablilhing Paganiftn again; but like KingJames II. he drove too hard ; and Julian had ioprovoked the whole RomUh empire which wasgenerally become Chriflian, that had th« spoliatelived he would not have been able to have heldthe throne; but as he was cut off in .his begin¬ning, Paganifm expired with him; and even Satanwith propriety might have joired him whi n mor¬tally wounded (throwing a handful of his ownblood, as it were at heaven), crying, Thou haltconquered me, O Galilean.Juvian, the next emperor, being a glcnouaChriliian, and a very good and great tnan, theDeVil abdicated for a while, and left the Chvillianarmies to re eltabJHh the orthodox faitnj r.orcould he bring ti e Chriltiani to a breach againamong themfelves a great while rfter. But ti eDevil, a more cunning filhermcn than ever St Pe¬ter was, foon fet the Bithops effeftually by theears with the new notion of Primacy; which baitthe prieOs eagerly fwsllowt d, and fcon fell tobanifving and paity-making (or the luperiotity ashea-tily as ever temporal r rants did for domi¬nion; and took as black and devililh methods tocarry 'tor, as the wcift of thofe tyrants everhad done before them.At laft Satan declared for the Roman pototyF,and that upon excellent conditions, in the reignof the emperor Mauvitus ; for Boniface, who hadlorg oontcrded for the title of.fuprer e, fell intoa treaty w ith Phocas captain of the emperor’sgustd; whether the bargain was from hell ornot, kt ary one judge, the conditions fcbfolute ycomw/^ to -'nnour of making tl et , ' v ,z' i^8t f^ocas firll murdered his matCoumcnenrPlr°r '"!* hisfons’ ^ifaceihouldror- o a * tre *®n, and declare him rmpe-* ttp’r, • m return, Phocas fliould acknowledgethe prunae. „f the ch urch of Rome and d Jwh7chZ ,blih‘'P- A bleffed compaA!in 'hh ri^ Ct tht- Devil to the head of affair*Poral ri r8nWOrId’ a8 " ^ fPiritual 85 tern-oveA v C Civii Since the conquefti C J0- Parac^fe> by which death and thenoinr J3” u10 a more importantpoint than he g^ned at this time.I hen he drew the Bifhop of Rome to fet upie the D.U^rI,S8eaatr)'<)'r In h u fet °Pen the ^tes o{ hell to themaii put them npon locking ur the gates of heaven,»nd gmng the Bifltcp the kiy ; /cheat which, Mblic LdM! tl"!D';'il fo gtlded over, or f.enSd n !g^t0,reC.UVeit’ that Gideon'ster fh a -jt^e <jatl'!ollc world went a-whoring af-idol A6 ^d°n 5 nd Lthe Bifll0P of Rorne fer‘t moreo etTn ieh?eVl1 bIit’ th-.ver he pretended, to let into heav.n, thongh he opened the door aswide as his key was able to doof key bdng g‘ven to thc BiHiopit Hmfel/ StJe?rWbo’ by the ™y> never had•therein , VtS loft by fomebody or*!d i; £he \z feems did not tell them who,)L thP a"S r°v again by a Lombard foldier,S outh wifh^rAntharisj Wh°’ attemptingdire* t J h,8Jkmfe'Was miraculoufly forced tothro?tAhJrd t0 £ia,.feIf’ and cu" hi‘ °wnIZZ ; V^ Ktng -ntharisand hisnobleS,hap-oeC r itlhlW OWd° ic’ and wer^ convertedkey wS yu y U; and that the KiRg i8nt thetl Jn R-? an°rther made ,ike *t» to Pope Pelagias,then Bifhop of Rome, who thereupon affumed 'v.and afterwards fetting a price' or toll upon theentrance, as wc do here at palling a turnpike;thefe fine things, 1 fay, were tuccefshillj managedfor fome years before this I am now Ipeaking of;and the Devil got a great deal of ground by ittoo; but now he triumphed openly, anti havingfet up a murderer on the temporal throne and a-church emperor upon the ecclefiaftic throne, andbotrvof his own chufing, the Devil may be faid tobegin his new kingdom from this epochs, and callit the federation.Since this time indeed, the Devil’s affairs wentvery merrily on, and the Clergy brought fo manygewgaws into their worfhip, and fuch devilifhprinciples were mixed with that which we callthe Chridian faith: that in a word, from thistiaie the. Bifnop of Rome commenced whore ofBtCylon in the molt exprefs terms that could beimagined; tyranny of the woift fort crept intothe pontificate ; errors of all forts into the pro-feffion ; --nd they proceeded from one thing to an¬other, till tfce very Popes, for fo the Bilhops ofSome were now called, by way of diftinaiou; If«y, the Popes thtmfelves, their fpirituol guides,profeffed openly to confederate with the Devil,and to carry on a perfonal and private eorref-po uce with him, at the fame time taking uponthem the titld of Chrift's Vicar, and the infallablegoids of the confciences of Chriftians,This wt have fundi y inftances of, in fome merryPopes, who, n fame lies not, were forcerers, ma-gici^as, had familiar fpirits, and immediate con.variation with the Devil, as well vifihly as iavi.Cb.e; and by this means became what we callDevd’s incarnate.Among the. mitances of Satan’s appearances, weha't tThr iallowing: Charles VI. of Jfaance, fur-n&med the beloved, was riding over the foreftnear Mon:, a ghifUf frightful fellow (that is tofay« th« D^vil fo clothed in human vizor came upto his horfe and taking ho:d of his bridle, ftopthim, with addition of thefe words, M Stop king:“ whether go ye : y»u are betrayed l’’ and irmne-distely dtfappeared. It is true the king h*d beendiftempercd in his head before and fo he mighthave been deceived; and we might perhaps havebeen led to have charged it to the acconnt of awhimfxcal brain, or the power of his imagina¬tions ; but this was in the face of his attendants,feveral of his great officer!,, courtiers, and princesof the blood, being with him, who all fay the manheard the words, and immediately to their aftonifh-ment, loft fight of the fpe&re, who vanifhed from9 them all.Tliefe are fome of the Devil’s extraordinaries,and it muft be confefled they are »ot the moft &-greeable to mankinds fer foiaetimes lie takes up¬on him to diforder his friends very much on thefeoccafions. And in the above cafe of Charles VI.O'- France, the king, they fay, was really dement¬ed ever, after that is, as we vulgarly, but not al¬ways improperly, exprefs it, he was really frightedout «f his wits. Whether the malicious Devilintended ir fo or not, is not certain, tho’ it was»ot fo foreign to his particular dnpofirion if bedid.It » true, Satan may be ebiiged to make differ¬ent appearances, as the fevefal circuraftances ofthings call for it; in fome places he makes his pa-,blic entry, and then he rauft fhow himfelf in thehabit of ceremony: in other cafes he comes uponprivate bufinsfs, and than he appears in difguiie;in fame cates he may think it fit to be in cog, andthen he appears drtffed ala mafque; fo the; fayhe i pprare i at the famous 3t Bartholomew s • cd-dii^ at Paris, where he came' in skdTcd like atrumpeter, danced in his habit, founded a levit,aad then went out and rung the alarm bell (which■was the lign il to begin the mafiacre) half an hourbefore the time appointed, led .the king’s mindfhould alter and his heart tail himf this ftory be not made upon him (for wefhould not (lander the Devil) it would fecm hewas tnoroughly latisfiad in King Charles the IX’afteadinefs in his caufe; for the king it teems hadrelaxed a little once before: Sstan might be a-fraid he would foil off again, and fo prevent theexecution. Others fay, that he did relent imme*diatel v after ringing the alarm-bell; but then itwas too late; the wark Wes • egun, and the rageof blood having been let loofe among the people,there was no recalling the order. Which was exe¬cuted ful'y; for every Proteftant in Paris waathiit night butchered, and they had been collectedby ‘air pronvdes from every corner in Prance.So long a feries of deiufion followed this, thatev- n the famous doctors of the faculty at Paris,■whenJo'.nFaullus brought the firft printed booksthat had then been feen in the world, or at leaftnot there, into the city aad fold them for manu-ferpts, they were furprifed at the performance,and queftioned Fsuftus about it; but he affirmiagthey were manuferipts, and that he kep a greatm : y c erks employed to write them, they werefatisiteti for a while.Hut looking farther into the work, they obfer-ved the exu& agreement of every book one withunotner that every line ftood in the lame place,ever pa^e a like number of lines, every lint alik; number of words; if a word was mit-fpelt ia•nt it wvs alfo mif-fpslt mail; nay, that ifthere was a blot in om a w** alike in ell; heybegan again to mui’e bow tb (houiube? -u aworn, the learned divines, not able to[ *4 jcomprehend the thing, iand that was always fu{-icient ■ concluded it mufl be tht Devil; that itwas done by magic and witchcraft; and that infliart, poor b'auftus fwho was indeed nothing buta mere printer) dealt with the Devil.So the learned doctors, not being able to UH"derftand how the work was performed, concludedas above, it >a-< all the Devil, and that the manwas a wizzard; accordingly they took him up fora magician, and a conjurer, and one that workedby the black art ; that is to fay, by the help ofthe Devil : and in a word, they threatened tohang him in their criminal court*, which madefach a noifc in the world, as raifed the fame ofpoor John Fauftus to a frightful height, till at lafthe was obliged for fear of the gallows, to difcoverthe whole fecret to them.N. B. This the true original of the famousDr Fauftus orFofter, of whom we have be¬lieved fuch flrange things, as that it is be¬come a proverb, as great as the Devil andDr Fauflus; whereas poor Fauflus was nodoflor, and knew no more of the Devil thanany other body.FT N I 5.

O CO t- 00FASHIONABLE SONGS.1 Th£ Death of Nelson.2 ’Tis the last Rose of Summer.3 The bonnie wee Rosebud.4 Blue Bonnets over the Border.Loch-na-Garr.The Lass o’ Gowrie.Jenny, the Maid of the Moor.Cease your Funning.THE DEATH OF NELSON.’Twas in Trafalgar’s bay,We saw the Frenchmen lay,Each heart was bounding then jWe scorn’d the foreign yokeOur ships were British oak,Hearts of oak our men.Our Nelson mark’d them on the wave.Three cheers our gallant seamen give,Nor thought of home or beauty;Along the line this signal ran—England expects that every manThis day will do his duty.2And now the cannons roarAlong the affVighted shore,Our Nelson led the way,His ship the Vict’ry nam’d ;Long be that Vict’ry fam’d !For vict’ry crown’d the day !But dearly was that conquest bought.Too well the gallant hero foughtFor England, home, and beauty;He cried, as ’midst the fire he ran—England expects that every manThis day w'ill do his duty.At last the fatal wound,Which spread dismay around,The hero’s breast receiv’d ;Hear’n fights on our side,The day’s our own, he cried ;Now' long enough Fve liv’d !In honour’s cause my life was past,In honour’s cause 1 fail at lastFor England, xhotne, and beauty !Thus ending life as he began,England confess’d that ev ry manlhat day had done Ids duty.'113 THE LAST ROSE OF SUMMER.Tits the last rose of summer left blooming alone;All her lovely companions are faded and gone;sNo flower of her kindred—no rosebud is nighTo reflect back her blushes, or give sigh for sigh.I’ll not leave thee, thou lone one, to pine on thestem;Since the lovely are sleeping, go, sleep thou withthem.Thus kindly I scatter thy leaves o’er the bed,Where thy mates of the garden lie scentless anddead.So soon may I follow when friendships decay,And from love’s shining circle the gems dropaway.When true hearts lie wither’d, and fond ones areflown,Oh ! who would "inhabit this bleak world alone ?THE BONNIE WEE ROSEBUD.A honnie wee rosebud grows down by yon burnic,A bonnie weft rosebud as e’er you did see ;Wi’ salt eilken leaves, underneath a green thornie :O spare the wee rosebud ! O spare it for me tThe redbreast sing? wanton around this sweetposie.Fond, fond to make love doth the w'ee birdieflee.Sure nane’d be sae cruel as steal frae my breastie,This bonnie wee rosebud—O spare it f..*r me!How fain would I change for the wee birdie’s sta¬tion !How blythe wad I peep ’neath the green thornvtree !Enraptur’d to muse, and transported to gaze onThis bonnie w'ee rosebud—O spare it for me !O hasten the moment, blest moment of pleasure,When lock’d to my breast the wee rosebudwill be,"United for ever, my soul’s dearest treasure—Do spare the wee rosebud, spare, spare it forme!BLUE BONNETS OVER THE BORDER.March, march, Ettrick and Teviotdale :Why, my lads, dinna ye march forward inorder ?March, march, Eskdale and Liddesdcle;All the blue bonnets are over the border.Many a banner spread flutters above your head,Many a crest that is famous in story;Mount and make ready then, sons of the moun¬tain glen,Fight for your Queen, and the old Scottishglory.Come from the hills where your hirsels are graz¬ingCome from the glen of the buck and the roe;fr£Come to the era* where the beacon is blazing :Come with the buckler, the lance, and thebow.Trumpets are sounding, war-steeds are bound-ing: —Stand to your arms and march in good order:England shall many a day tell of the bloodyfray,When the blue bonnets came over the border.LOCH-NA-GARR.Away, ye gay landscapes, ye gardens of roses.In you let the minions of luxury rove;Restore me the rocks where the snow-flake re¬poses,If stiil they are sacred to freedom and love.Yes, Caledonia, dear are thy mountains,Round their white summits tho’ elements war,Tho’ cataracts foam ’stead of smooth flowingfountains,I sigh for the valley of dark Loch-na-garr.Ah ! there my young footsteps in infancy wan¬der’d ;My cap w’as the bonnet, my cloak was the plaid:On chieftains departed my memory ponder’d,As daily I stray’d through the pine cover’d glade.I sought not my home till the day’s dying gloryGave place to the rays of the bright polar star;6For fancy was cheer’d by traditional story,Disclos’d by the natives of dark Loch-na-garr.Shades of the dead ! have I not heard your voicesRise on the night-rolling breath of the gale !Surely the soul of the hero rejoices,And rides on the wind, o’er his own Highlanddale.Round Loch-na-garr, while the stormy mist ga¬thers,Winter presides in his cold icy car;Clouds there encircle the forms of my fathers,They dwell ’mid the tempests of dark Loch-na-garr.THE LASS O’ GOWRIE.’Twas on a simmer’s afternoon,A wee before the sun gaed down,My lassie wi' a braw new gown,Came o’er the hill to Gowrie.The rosebud, ting’d wi’ morning showers,Bloom’d fresh within the sunny bowers,But Kitty was the fairest flowerThat ever bloom’d in Gowrie.I had nae thought to do her wrang,But round her waist my arms I flang,And said, ‘ My lassie, will ye gangTo view the Carse o’ Gowrie ?7I’R take ye to my father’s ha’,In yon green field beside the shavr.And make you lady o’ them a’,The brawest wife in Gowrie.'Saft kisses on her lips I laid,The blush upon her cheek soon spread;She whisper’d modestly, and said,“ I’ll gang wi’ you to Gowrie.”The auld folk soon gied their consent,And to Mess John we quickly went,Wha tied us to our heart’s content,And now she’s Lady Gowrie,SWEST JENNY, THE MAID OF THEMOOR.Thu lasses of Scotland are bonnie and free ;The maidens of Erin are fair;The sweet girls of Britain are lovely to see—And let them deny it who dare •,13ut the fairest of lasses that all those surpasses,Is Jenny, the maid of the moor.Sweet Jenny, dear Jenny,bweet Jenny, the maid of the moor.The lasses of Scotland are tender and true;The maidens of Erin are kind ;The sweet girls of Britain can monarch* subdue,And lovely in person and mind :8Yet ths fairest of lasses, that all those surpasses.Is Jenny, the maid of the moor.Sweet Jenny, dear Jenny,Sweet Jenny, the maid of the moor.The lasses of Scotland are fam’d far and near ;The maidens of Erin breathe love ;l he sweet girls of Britain to Britons are dear,And soft as the down on the dove .•Still the fairest of lasses, that all those surpasses,Is Jenny, the maid of the moor.Sweet Jenny, dear Jenny,Sweet Jenny, the maid of the moor.CEASE YOUR FUNNING.Cease your funning, force or cunningNever shall my heart trepan-,All these sallies are but malice,To seduce my constant man.’Tis most certain, by their flirting,Women oft have envy shown ;Pleas’d to ruin other’s wooing,Never happy in their own.KILMARNOCK:printed Jor the Bookiellers.

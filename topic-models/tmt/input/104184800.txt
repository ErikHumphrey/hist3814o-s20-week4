He was early put to school, whenhe acquired a good knowledge of Eng¬lish Gran?mar, Writing and Arithmetic.About the age of ten, a trifling acci¬dent occurred at home, which for fearof punishment from his father, deter-mined him to leave home, and fromthat moment he dated the commence¬ment of his sinful career. He had madeno wicked acquaintance ac yet, but com-4Imtted several depredations by himseThe first of these was stealing a B:;tarn cock ffcm a woman at the backthe New Town, Edinburgh. Haviitaken a fancy to it, be offered to buybut the woman would not sell it ;tell on the scheme of putting anotlcock of his own a-fighting, and tfcame off with his prize. His ne^t vlifting a shop till from a poor womanStock-Bridge. Being some miles frutown and tired, he mounted a ponwhich was grazing on the road side, arode home, where he kept it for sottime, in an out house* where he hadfimerly kept a Cuddie ; he kept it thefor several days, until the owner fouit out by accident. At Leith races1813, he enlisted in the Nohfolk Allitra, and learned the Drum and Bug,horn j the Regiment was disbandedabout a year afterwards, and he was dicharged. His father was then liviin the south back of the CannongatEdinburgh, and he went home, wh'he was put as an apprentice to the Milwright and engineering business, vviCockburn and Baira1, in theCannongat15I where he behaved with honesty* andwas very well liked by his employers.His master having giving up businessshe was of course thrown idle, and at thisitime got acquainted with many worth¬less characters, among whom was oneBarney, an Irishman, he had been bredia tailor in Dumfries, he was older thanHaggart, of great bodily strength, anda most skillful pickpocket.—Barney puthim up to a number of tricks, and they.agreed to travel together. In August1817* when just on the point of goingto England, they past a day at Porto-icbello Races, and picked a Gentleman’supocket of £11. the first ever Haggartliattempted in day-light; with this tooki| outside places on the Jedburgh Coachiii and got themselves genteely dressed.I They attended St. James’ fair at Kelso,Hand picked c£20 from two persons ;t| from thence tney went to Dumfries,(. and stopt three weeks, they attended!: Lockerby fair, and going into a publict house, a farmer and drover were cast-1 ing out, when Barney blew the coal,I and they fell a fighting, and both tum-I bled ; Barney picked the farmer’s pock-0et of £28. Haggart called for the]waiter, and appeared in a violent pas¬sion, paid for a bottle of porter, abusedhim for putting them into such com¬pany, and immediately left the house.They departed next morning, and wentto Langholm fair, where they took frcmljia sheep farmer, ^100, in ten poundjjfnotes, and ^J0, in ^0 shilling notes-About half an hour after, they saw JohiRichardson, a DumfriesT)ffieer, runningabout, but he did not notice them|They took a post-chaise, and went tc|Annan, and next day took the Coacifor Carlisle.On other nights they got 2 gold vvatfdies; they took about £70 in wholfduring their stay in Newcastle. The;[then went to Durham and at nighlijbroke a lonely house on the road t]York; they got ^20 here ; they werjapprehended for this act, tried, anfound Guilty, and put back to prisoito be brought up for sentence of deadat the end of the assizes—They brokithe prison that night, but Haggart onlescaped : he provided himself withrope-ladder, and gave the saw to Ba|7Hey, who made his escape that samei night. When Haggart was coming toi Durham from York witn his saw, incompany with a York pick pocket, theywere pursued by two constables ; andi just as one was apprehending Haggart,he laid him low with his pistol.—They;j got clear away, and he never knew whe¬ther the man was murdered or not, but( he thought so.—They next went ioColdstream fair, and Barney being foundattempting a farmer’s pocket, got threemonths in Jedburgh jail. Haggartwent to Newcastle again, and to thesame lodgings, where he was treatedI like a son ; little did the people knowwho they were so kind to.—He did nu¬merous tricks here, and then proceededto Edinburgh, where he carried on the,same line ; he did not live in his father’shouse.In September he started for Perthwith one Henry, and had some adven¬tures.—They returned to Leith, andwere taken by the Police for some crimesgot bail, and were liberated.Haggart had a number of adventuresin Edinburgh and neighbourhood, and8was put 4 months in Bridewell.—Afterbeing released, he met with some of hiscompanions, and took a trip throughthh North : lie was in Aberdeen jail forsome time, and after committing moredepredations, returned to Edinburgh.They broke into several houses inEdinburgh and Leith, and on NewYear’s morning 1820 Haggart had forhis share, 5 Silver Watches and a Goldone, taken on the South and North brid¬ges.—He remained in Edinburgh tillthe IStb, when he was taken up ami putinto the Lock-updiouse to find bail ; hegot out, and one night paid a visit tothe Lock-up-house, and gave the keep¬er so much drink, that lie got the key,and liberated six prisoners.He went to Leith the night follow¬ing, and took lodgings in Cupar street,and lived with a woman of the town ;while here,, he committed various actsin Leith, Edinburgh, and neighbour¬hood, by tying some shop doors, thrust-,iog his iiand through the windows andgrasping whatever goods lay in his road,breaking into numerous houses, pickingpockets oi watches, &c.—In the course' 9fctf these operations he removed to dii>ferent lodgings.On the 1st of March, while sitting inhis lodgings with h pickpocket of thename of Finest, in Johnston Street,North Leith, Captain Uoss of the Pol-ce and one of his men came in uponithem : Ross seized Forrest and carriedaim off* leaving Haggart in charge otthe Policeman ; when left alone, thei Policeman opened a bed-room door, andi vas looking into it. When Haggart for¬ced him in, locked the door, and wasnaking his way down the stair, when|e was met by Ross and another Pol¬iceman ; a struggle commenced, buthe three overpowered Haggart, andtie was carried to the Police OfficeStreaming with blood. He was kepti#ere two days, and then put into theijjaii to stand trial.—On the 27th March>e got a smdt file, and cut the chainsM* nis legs, penetrated through twohick walls with his handcuffs, liberatedrorrest, and got to the outside about5 o’clock next morning—When on theu\r stair, he saw a man coming upJueen Street, and he prepared to give!•10liiin battle ; but the man only said,“ Run, Jtlaggart, run, 1 wont touchye.” Haggart took hold of Forrest’shand, and ran even on to Dalkeith,without stopping, stopped there allBight, and stole 12 yards blue cloth,started at two o’clock next morning forKelso, robbed a farmer of *£4. and setoff for Dumfries.— They were joinevlby 2 other pick-pockets, one of whomwas hanged shonly after at Glasgow.Jn Dumfries he picked several pock¬ets, and entered different dwelling-houses, when he met in with his oldfriend, Barney JYFGuire, never havingseen him since they parted at Kelso inISIS. They were intending to leaveDutn-iiies that night, but Barney was taken up.Haggart started for Carlisle next mor¬ning, but w'as overtaken and carriedback to Dumfries ? Captain Ross arriv¬ed in a few days, and carried him backto Leith jail.Barney was transported for fourteenyears. H ggart was tried at Edinburghon the 12th of July, but got off; he wasthen sent to Dumfries, to stand trial atthe circuit there for house-breakiug,11"lis trial did not go on, and lie wasent back to jail.—Here he got acquaintt'ith a iad, John Dunbar, who was un*er sentence of transportation. He al»o got acquaint with some people be-onging to the town, who seemed wil¬ling to do him a favour, so Haggartnade the plans of four keys, and a per-on vm to get them made for him,here being 4 doors betwixt lbs cell andhe street. Haviag thus as he thought,ecured his liberty, he was too fc. s ily?d into another scheme with Dunbar,laggart thought nimself certain of his-jwn liberty, but be thought it woulde a grand thing to clear the jail of allibe prisoners. Laurie, another prison-,r, proposed getting a stone, and tying■i; in a napkin, and some morning toiinock down Hunter, the head jailor,nd take the keys from him. Haggartli/as not fond of using the stone, as hehid not want to hurt the jailor ; and hereposed, when Thomas Morrin cameip to the man under sentence of death,o gag him into a closer, at the head ofhe stair, and take the keys from him ;Dunbar and some others got the stone^and put it into a bag. On Tuesday the3 0th of October, about twelve o’clock,they noticed Hunter the head turnkeyleave the jaii to attend the Races, andshortly after, Morrin came up with twoministers, whom he locked m the cellwith M'Grory, who was under sentenceol death.—Shortly after, Haggart plac¬ed himself in the closet at the head olthe stair, where he had previously putthe stone and bag. Dunbar then cal¬led up Morrin to lei out the ministers.He came up Accordingly with a plate ofpotatoe-?oup for M Grery, and when hegot to the top of the stair, Haggartcame out upon him frcivi the closet, and.the pushing open of (he doer knockedthe plate out ot his hand ; he then struckturn one blow with the stone, dashedhim down, and without the In s of a mo¬ment, pulled the key of the cuter doorfrom iiis pocket; be gave only one blowwith the stone and threw it down. Dun¬bar picked it up, but no more blowsw ere given, so that Mornn must havereceived his other blows in tailing.Haggart observed Dunbar on the’topof him, rifling his breast for the kev13which he had got. Simpson had a holdbf Motrin’s shoulders, and was beatingibis back upon the steps of the stair.IHaggart rushed past them, crossed thestair as steadily as hegcould, p'ulled theeey from his pocket, and opened theniter door.On getting out at the door he ranround the east corner of the jail wall,and then walked rapidly round the backdreet, and round a great part of thetown, till he came to the back of theKing’s Arms Inn. Dunba: made up:o him, and that very moment they sawi policeman coming right up to meetthem ; cn this they wheeled about andran, but Dunbar was taken before he!iran ten yards, and Haggart had theimortification to see his fellow adventur¬er secured ; he once thought of boltingkmong them to rescue him, but themob was too great for him ; he wenttip through the yard of the King’s Armswithout meeting any body, crossed the^iigh Street, an Iran down the Vermelfo the Nith. He kept along the water¬side till he got away to the east ofCum-i Sungau Wood, having run nearly ten14mites in less than an hour. He thengot on the high road to Annan, whenhe saw a post-chaise at full gallop almostwithin 20 yards of him. Upon this hebuttoned his coat, and leapt a hedgeinto a field where some people wereraisipg potatoes. They all joined thepolice-men, who had got out of thechaise in pursuit of him j he crossedthe field at a slapping pace, and madefor Cumlungan Wood ; he bolted overa very deep ditch covered with briers,and ran a few steps along the side ofthe hedge, to make the police-menthink he was going into the wmod ; hethen wheeled round, louted, and whenthey went up the one side of the ditchhe ran down the other: little did theyknow he was so near them, he couldhave breathed upon John Kichardson,as he passed him. in this way he cameto the cross road which leads from theNith to the public road, and never dida fox double the hounds in better style.He then made for Annan, and get¬ting on a mile or two on the Carlisleroad, he went into a belt of planting.Watching an opportunity, he dived in-15D a hay stack, and lay there till nextlay at two o’clock in the afternoon,yhen he heard a woman ask a boy ifpat iad was taken who had broke outIf Dumfries jail; the boy answered, no,iut the jailor died last night. On hear¬ing this, Ilaggart lay insensible for aood while ; he left the stack, and see¬ing a scare crow in a field, he tookiome of the old clothes and put themin to disguise himself. On the Wed-esday night he slept in a hay-loft; inhe morning 2 men were feeding theiricrses, and he overheard them speak-Jpg about him ; he started for Carlisle,nd then to Newcastle, where he slop¬ed for some days, and along with oneifieming, picked £22. in the marketTorn a man ; here he passed close toJ ohn Richardson, who was in quest ofilim, but was not noticed. He leftNewcastle for Scotland, he got uponihe Berwick Coach, and then took aicket for Edinburgh, but only went toDunbar in the Coach, remained in Dun-ar, and set off for Edinburgh nexticroing, met with a gentleman, andook the same lodgings with him in the16Lord Demean Tavern, Canongate. Af¬ter seperating from the gentleman, hestopt at Jock’s Lotlge with a friend ;while here he visited his father andsome acquaintances, disguised in wo¬men’s clothes. One night dressed inhis own clothes, taking a walk fromPortobello to Leith, hs met CaptainRoss or the Leith Police, their eyes metand l^oth stood motiorjess until Haggartfeigned to pull a pistol from his breast,the captain knowing him too well be¬fore, immediately took to his heels, andHaggart immediately turned throughthe fields, and made to Jock’s Lodge;he then crossed the Forth, and wentthrough Cupar to Dundee, and disguis¬ed himself in sailor’s clothes ; here hecommitted a number of depredations.He then returned to Newhaven, andwent up to Edinburgh, and the firstthing he saw was a bill posted up, offer¬ing a reward of 70 Guineas for his ap¬prehension, this determined him to gonorth again ; he arrived in Dundee, andfrom thence went to Perth ; lie attendedthe fairs in Perth, Dunkeld, Kenmore,&c. and roDbed some Cattle-Dealers to aI considerable amount. One night in his'lodgings in Perth, 2 policemen camenin upon him, but the determined man-mer in which he received them, made(them hesitate in apprehending him, andHaggart gained an opportunity to es¬cape ; he left Perth for Glasgow, andmade up his mind to go to Ireland, andstarted in the Steam Boat; here he wasrecognized by the Provost of Kircaldy,who went ashore at Lamlash, Haggart;,was ready to jump overboard, but theboat went off without the Provost j helanded in Belfast, where he attendediairs, &c and was in continual scenestof robbing, knocking down, &c. At'Drutnmore market he was seized and(taken before a magistrate ; he was ask-led what name he had, he answered inhigh Tipperara, it was John M‘Colganrifrom Armagh ; he was cross examined,land shewn a Dublin paper with a des-icription of his person, &c. he deniedbeing a Scotsman, and passed off’ thebrogue so well, that the magistrate wasan doubts, but he was ordered to be de-fained, anil three yeomen sat in theourt-house to guard him ; he plied18them so well with drink, that he pre-^jvailed on them to let a young womanbring him some supper, and when shecame, he got leave to speak with herprivately behind the boxes of the court,,where there is a large window, he bolt¬ed right thro’ the window without beinghurt by the fall: he crossed the street,and into an entry, where he saw hiskeepers below the window staring aieach other; he started for Belfast, antthen to Dublin, and paid his passagifor America at the Pigeon house, bumeeting in with one called O’Brien, hchanged his mind ; here he robbedman in LOO guineas in gold, and jaunteithrough the country in Cars with wcmen of bad fame ; he was taken up fcrobbing a drover at Downpatrick, anput into jail, where he saw more sceneof wickedness than ever he had witnesed all his life; the women’s room wiimmediately above the men’s, anddays’ provision was served out to theat one time ; they blocked up the door (imade a hole betwixt the 2 apartment tand kept possession in the most rioto:manner j before his trial he bribed t!19: drover not to swear he was the person,tand he was banished for 7 years; injail he was visited by the magistrate ofJDrummore, who ordered the jailor to: put him in strong irons.Haggart denied that he had everbeen in Drummore, and said his namej was O’Brien, and not M'Colgan ; he was; moved to Kilnaainham jail among otherj criminals ; here he made his escape, buti was catched by some of the prisonersinforming the jailor of his designs.Next day the whole of the prisonersi were called out into the courtyard, andin a few minutes John Richardson fromI Dumfries made his appearance, and be-i| gan his examination ; he passed himonce, but upon a second look over herecognized him, and said, Davie, do youI ken me 9 Haggart turned to the jailor,t| and in a master.piece of Irish brogue,said, what does the man say ? don’t youknow him, was the answer; he said he> did not, but John persisted that he did.I On the 2d day he was put in irons, andj| conducted by John and an Irish Officerij to Dumfries. They were 3 days and|f 3 nights on the road, and he experien-20bed great kindness from the officers.On their approach to Dumfries, thou¬sands of people met them with torchesin their hands. From Dumfries he wasconveyed to Edinburgh jail, and placed,under the care of Captain Sibhald, whohe said, was the kindest jailor in theworld. He was tried on the 11th ofJune, and the Jury gave in a verdict of;guilty ; when the Judge was passing thesentence, he said he grew dizzy andigasped for breath ; he was carried backto jail, where he behaved in the mostpenitent manner, and wrote a history ofhis life for behoof of his father, fromwhich this narrative is a faithful extract.EXECUTION.t:i Early on the morning of this execu¬tion, David Haggart joined earnestlyin devotional exercise with his minis-| terial attendant. After the Chaplainmi of ihe Jail had given a prayer, one ofI the officers of justice appeared, and re-i tire, as he had something to commun-i| icate to the unhappy prisoner.— Hag-ii gart immediately exclaimed in a hur-ii ried tone, Oh ! I suppose it is the ex-il ecutioner.” His firmness for a mo¬il ment abandoned him, and he walkedn rapidly across the cell, with his armsii folded, and with dark and deep des-q pair strongly painted on his counten-nance. He speedily, however, regainedI his composure: and when the execu-2%tioner did appear, at once allowed Idarms to be bound, he was then removedto a hall in the lower part of the Lockupi-house, where he was received by tw*of the clergymen of Edinburgh, and thmagistrates. After prayers, the prccession proceeded to the scaffold. Thconduct of the unfortunate youth therwas in the highest degree becoming"While the beneficial influence of reSgion was apparent in his whole deme !nour, his natural firmness of chaiactinever for a moment forsook him; 1kneeled down, and uttered an earne|prayer, and, after addressing a fe!words of deep and anxious exhortatioito the great multitude by wliich he wsurrounded, he met his fate with tlsame intrepidity, which distinguish'all the actioiis of his short, but guil Li*and eventful life.23The following song was made by Hag*gart the day after his condemnation ;but his mind soon changed to a more.serious subject, and his whole deport¬ment was extremely pious.Able and willing, you will me find,Though bound in chains, still free inmind;For with these things I’ll ne’er be griev’d,Although of freedom I’m bereav’d.I am a rogue, I don’t deny.But never liv’d by treachery;And to rob a poor man I disown.But them that are of high renown.Now, for the crime I am condemned,The sa me I never did intend,Only my liberty to take,As I thought my life did lie at stake.24No malice in my heart is found,To any man above the ground,Now, all good people that speak of me,You may ssy I died for my liberty.Although in chains you see me fast,No frown upon my friends you’ll cast,For my relations were not to blame.And I brought my parents to grief andshame.Farewell relations and friends also,The time is come that I must go jAs for foes, I have but one,But to the same 1 have done no wrong.1 finis.

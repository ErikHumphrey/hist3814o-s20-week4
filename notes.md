# Notes â€” Week 4

## Excel & R

* I have an intermediate understanding of Excel, but it's a good idea to do this brief exercise on the basics.
* I've heard a lot jokes about pivot tables coming up a lot on job interviews and people not having much experience with them. They're really not all that complicated, I think.
* To get the sum of female children from 1 to 4 years of age, I put the formula `=SUM(P15500:P15503)` in cell R15500.

### Basic counting and plotting in R

* I noticed that the plot preview generated by R resizes dynamically to fit the window, hiding labels and such if necessary. This makes sense given the ability to zoom with the network graphs in Week 3, but it's nice to know that it's infinitely scalable. Although they're still flexible, some other statistical packages I've used, like Minitab, felt more like they were generating raster graphics that were teh same as if they were exported as an image. In a sense, both are still "what you see is what you get" (WYSIWYG), though.
* One drawback of R Studio is that you can't drag or copy resulting plots, tables, etc. directly into documents and spreadsheets like you can with Minitab.

* I tried all the visualizations under "Preface" and "Basic Histogram", and made a note to try out the rest later. Line graphs and scatter plots drew the most appeal to me, and would definitely be the most useful visualization for certain types of data.

## Voyant

* I had never heard of this tool before.

### Introduction

### Explore the newspaper corpus

> corpus: a collection of written texts, especially the entire works of a particular author or a body of writing on a particular subject. *(Source: Google, `define corpus`)*

### Build your own corpus

### Going further

## AntConc

* I had also never heard of this one before.
* AntConc was even easier to install than OpenRefine from Week 3; the Windows download was simply an executable (EXE). I chose to use the 64-bit version, and it ran fine without having to install any dependencies I don't yet have.
* I followed the tutorial with the given corpus with no issues.
  * Loading the corpus folder revealed that it had a total of 3080 TXT files.
  * I made a simple search for "the". During this time, the program was predictably unresponsive, but after allowing it a couple minutes to process all the files and several more minutes for it to count all the Concordance Hits (or process something else about all the files), it returned that "the" appeared at 488,253 times across all the files (case-insensitive, because I left "Case" unchecked).

  I noticed that nouns mostly apepared after "the" (not pictured), with a variety of types of words appearing before "the".

  * I did it again for "a". Concordance Hits: 225,822. That's less than half the number of "the" hits. 
  
  Though "the" and "a" are different kinds of articles, the words appearing near them weren't too different. It surprised me that there were more instances of "the" than "a". I guess the writing style here demands more use of definite articles (before a noun that is known to the reader), rather than indefinite articles (for general objects or objects of unknown identity).
  * I did it again for "shot". Concordance Hits: 546.
  * The sort feature is handy!
  * I'm guessing a search for `wh*` would allow anything after "wh" in the word, like "while", "when", and "where", whereas `wh?` would only show words with three characters, like "why" or "who", but not "whom". This would also match the descriptions in the Wildcard Settings interface.
  * It's also worth noting that `wh?` requires a character, whereas `wh+` would also find just "wh". `wh*` can find "wh".
  * I was right. For posterity, `wh*` had 346,960 Concordance Hits, while `wh?` had 331,460 Concordance Hits. Surprisingly close!
  * I saved the sorted outputs "wh-asterisk-sorted.txt" and "wh-questionmark-sorted.txt".
  * The "or" operator (`|`), collocates, word lists, and keyword lists also seem like extremely useful tools for a variety of comparisons.

* I was pleasantly surprised to see that AntConc allowed for wildcard settings to be customized.

### Going further

* I've made a note to complete the Jupyter notebook later. For now, I gleaned it to get the gist of it. The graphical interface of AntConc is simple to use, but limited compared to the programmatic approach of using Python libraries. There are pros and cons to both.
  * Incidentally, Jupyter has always been a pretty good way of organizing a walkthrough, and the interactivity it allows is pretty nice. The last time I used it was for generating some sort of deep learning / machine learning model (or neural network?) that allowed me to feed in a document of facts and then input questions, after which it would return the most likely answer to the question given the facts. Microsoft Azure's [QnA Maker](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/qna-maker/) API has a similar idea with a more user-friendly approach. But I digress.

## Topic models

## Bonus

### Image analysis

* The images on this page remind me of the cryptic images used in [wargames / "Capture The Flag" cyber-security challenges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wargame_(hacking)). I've done a few iterations of a beginner-level event at Carleton University, [Hack All The Things](https://h4tt.ca/).
* The *Popular Science Monthly* magazine covers are from around the First World War and the Second World War. The art style is certainly reminiscent of propaganda poster art around the time.
* I deleted the files mentioned and corrected some file names. I also made many file names more descriptive of the image, to match the others.
* Imj proved to be yet another extremely useful tool, which I'll be sure to use again in the future.
